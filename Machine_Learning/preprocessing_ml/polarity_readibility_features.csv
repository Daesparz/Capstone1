Réveille Coffee,"This is a cute coffee shop, I love the ambiance, the coffee and service are great. The only downside to coming to this cafe is that they only have one outlet making it hard to charge devices while working, the one outlet they do have is VERY loose (meaning your charger will fall out of it). Other than that, nice and friendly environment. Remember, no wifi on the weekends.

Réveille Coffee,"I wanted to like this place, however the ventilation is so poor in this Cafe and the smell of bleach permeated the coffee shop. Not only that, I saw cleaning supplies left carelessly outside the bathroom which I thought was very sloppy. Though the furniture is nice and the food is okay, this major detail of bleach was so bad. My coffee tasted of bleach because of the smell. By the end of my time drinking coffee here, my eyes were burning. I wish I were not exaggerating because I really wanted to like this place in the Castro, but I think the management needs to rethink the way they do hygiene at the coffee shop.

They don't make their own syrups in house which also makes it not worth the high price tag. A place back home that I love makes their own syrups and their lattes are less than this.

Came here to order a large cold brew and they said it's only one size, which is small/mediumish. When I received the cup, it was 3/4 full and a lot of ice. There is no place to stand when you are for your drink so you're kinda floating around awkwardly while inches away from the people that are sitting down. The area where people stand to wait for their drinks is also the area where you get your cream and sugar, so it's blocking the way to that.

The Mill,"I haven't rated anything on Yelp in eons, but felt compelled to after my experience today because this place made me actually mourn the death of customer service--such a bummer! Having tried a very good bread from the Mill (someone had brought me some), I called to see if was in stock and ask a few questions before visiting the bakery. I should've known something was up when it was as though I was totally inconveniencing the person who answered the phone. [note: see Thien's review, several reviews before this one].  I went anyway, with a friend, to buy/eat a loaf of that bread, with almond butter, accompanied by coffee drinks, and to photo/recommend their bread to my network of 600 or so foodies. I asked if a slice of the bread could be toasted. No. They ""don't toast things between 5-6 a matter of policy"" (when they switch over from serving bread to serving pizza) and there weren't ""enough people there to toast bread."" I don't know if the contamination issue was because of gluten (?) or why they thought they were short staffed (the place was fairly empty, there were 3-4 people behind the counter/in kitchen) but I was so shocked at the rigidity of a bakery whose business is partly based on toast not being able to toast bread (for someone about to spend $20 on an afternoon coffee) or to either explain why and/or lift a finger to accommodate us (e.g. ""we're sorry, but we can at least heat it for you"" or ""we can slice it and put the almond butter on it anyway""), that I pressed the cashier to understand (I grew up working in the food/hospitality industry in SF and travel widely and this was highly unusual). The cashier, who clearly had little life experience, said, ""you don't need to behave like this"" several times. Behave? Is that really what you want to say to an enthusiastic customer, 30 years your senior, who has come to buy, enjoy and promote your products? The next question was, ""do you still want the bread?"" No thanks. And don't worry, I won't be back. My friend said she'd experienced poor customer service there too (she has worked in the industry as well). I feel sorry for the owner's loss in business because of this, and am just sad at the loss of basic training and manners in general.

Rise & Grind Coffee and,"Went here yesterday afternoon with my sister after viewing the Monet exhibition at the de Young museum since it was conveniently located by the park and I was in serious need of caffeine. For 4PM on a Sunday, the shop was quite full, but my sister and I were able to grab seats right next to the wall of local art. I love coffee shops that support local artists, so this was a definite plus.We ordered the London Fog (tea latte) and one of their specialties, Mint Cold Brew. We asked them to go easy on the syrup since we both don't enjoy super sweet things (for reference, we ask for 50% sweet at boba shops, lol). For their coffee, they use Mr. Espresso beans, but I'm not sure what they use for their tea. I've never had Mr. Espresso before, so I was intrigued.I expected the Mint Cold Brew to be kind of like the Mint Mojito from Philz, but without the milk. Even with them going on easy on the syrup though, I found it to be saccharine, to the point of it being unbearable. Even after waiting for the ice to dissolve, it was still a little too sweet for me. Granted, I generally enjoy my coffee black, but still, even with expectations that this drink would be sweet, I found it to be kind of gross. It ruined any redeeming qualities of the coffee. I drank about half yesterday and finished it this morning and I can still feel this unsavory taste on my tongue two hours later. Would not recommend this drink.However, I think they nailed the London Fog - I actually enjoyed drinking that. It wasn't too sweet and the taste of the early grey was delicious.Not sure if I would come back, but if I do, I will probably try a pour over instead to see if the coffee itself is good.",3.0,2019-02-25,0.17013227513227513,0.5240638990638992,0.22157142857142859,0.766,0.242,-0.9217,NEGATIVE,0.9999945163726807,75.34,8.0,6.67,9.3,6.72,41,6th and 7th grade,75.34,8.0,9.3,6.72,1680

Plus, plover just sounds good. Smooth, soft, like the bird and the cream. So, thoughts: Espresso is bitter and coupled with carbonation this drink probably isn't for people with sensitive tubes.

She offered their ice coffee with a shot of espresso to match the strength of a cold brew. Then she offered to make sort of sweetened creamer for me and that with their house made whipped cream the drink was absolutely delicious. The coffee had a great taste and that extra shot of espresso had me wired for the 5 hr drive I had to embark on. They were pretty busy but my drink came out rather quickly. If you're on your way to Ocean beach you need to stop by this cute coffee shop and get your caffeine fix.,5.0,2019-05-27,0.3329861111111111,0.771875,0.2015,0.799,0.25075000000000003,0.9107,POSITIVE,0.9998263716697693,86.64,5.7,5.8,7.0,5.77,10,5th and 6th grade,86.64,5.7,7.0,5.77,655
Andytown Coffee,"This review is for the Snowy Plover. Been wanting to try it for a long time and finally made my way over to try it out. Its an iced espresso drink with a cream soda, brown sugar syrup, and their homemade whipped cream and it cost about $5.00. Overall, I enjoyed the drink and thought it was really refreshing! Loved all the flavor combinations of the drink. At first the fizziness threw me off, but it works! This coffee shop is really cute and hipster, which Im a sucker for.

Andytown Coffee,I was introduced to this Snowy Plover by my bff who swears there's nothing else like it in the city! I was truly intrigued by this bubbly fizzy iced coffee drink topped with homemade in-house whipped cream?? 10/10 have to try again and again because I can't get enough of it. I believe this is their signature drink. Their pastries and cookies look amazing too. I've only had their breakfast cookie twice and I'm hooked! There's corn flakes in the cookie....bomb. Matcha latte is also good here. Matcha isn't bitter and goes good with that frothy milk. Ask for extra hot if you don't want your latte to get cold within a few mins! I also don't ever mind a good drip coffee as well which is underrated here. It's aromatic and just gives me that afternoon pick me up I need!

I never thought that a whipped cream could leave such a major impact on my life, but I think about it to this day.

Andytown Coffee,"Personally, I am a huge fan of coffee. Andytown offers a unique twist to their drinks. There's something about espresso and Pellegrino that's soooo right! They make their own whipped cream. My favorite is their snowy plover (they may have renamed it). It's basically espresso with Pellegrino topped off with their homemade whipped cream. make sure you mix it all up before drinking. Probably my favorite caffeinated drink ever. It's great that Andytown is so eco friendly. Their cups are compostable and they only use paper straws. Of course, you can take it to the next level and purchase one of their reusable metal straws for less than the price of a cup of coffee.

Me, on the other hand, kept it boring and had their wind & sea blend drip coffee with a ton of their delicious heavy cream.  I admit it, the Plover that my wife had was awesome.  But I can't deny it, my coffee was delicious too and worth another trip back.  Overall, I highly recommend Andytown Coffee Roasters.

I asked the cashier what the Bombon is and he said it's ""2 shots of espresso over condensed milk."" Alright, so I decided to try it. And then I got it eventually after waiting in a busy line. Then, it was handed to me in a small, cardboard espresso cup(well, I wanted it to-go)...and it looked like chocolate milk or mocha. And then I had the Bombon. I had to sip it and then I judged it. It was a mocha-like espresso and I did not feel the texture of condensed milk, but it was a little sweeter I'd say. Hmm...trying very interesting coffee drinks is fun...and a total waste of cash...but it makes my reviews more interesting on Yelp..so here's to the ""Bombon"" at Snowbird!Snowbird has some apparel on sale, and you can hang out at the cafe.

Totally fine by me and my stomach! The hot chocolate was really good. Not only did it come out steaming hot, they even accommodated and made me a swirly foam peak instead of topping it with whipped cream. A small hot chocolate is $3.75, and dairy-free milks are an additional 50 cents.There is WiFi and plenty of seating for people who want to duck in and do some work.

Fifty / fifty managed to keep the aroma limited which I appreciate, but the latte still didn't really taste like much.

Fifty / Fifty Coffee and,"Fifty fifty is a great neighborhood coffee shop. The place has a about 4 tables with seats and another long table by the window with about 5 stools. They offer free wifi for their customers if you chose to work on things there. They have a nice bathroom but you have to ask the barista for access to it. They offer a stamp card, for every 10 drinks you get 1 for free. If you order multiple drinks and use the stamp card the baristas are usually nice enough to take off the more expensive drink. They have pastries sometimes but it's not my favorite. Drinks on average are $4-5 here.Customer service is excellent here. There are usually 2-3 baristas working at a time and will get to you within a minute or two of you entering the shop. Very patient when you don't know what to order and can offer suggestions. They offer a variety of milk, whole milk, coconut, and almond milk. I believe it does cost extra for the coconut and almond milk.All their selections of teas and coffees are delicious although I tend to order their cappuccino. There have been one or two instances when my cappuccino had just a tad more milk but was delicious regardless. Teas/tea lattes: You can get their teas either iced or hot. Their matcha tea is usually pretty good although sometimes it can be a little bit on the milky side. Their Thai iced tea only comes iced so it's a bummer when you want it warm but usually pretty good. Their lavender earl gray is my personal favorite. You can add boba to any iced teas past noon.

Golden Bear Trading,"Kris here. Tried this place today. Tried the Turkish Coffee (No cream or sugar), the Turkish Mocha, and the Turkish Coffee with Cream and Sugar and the baklava. My favorite was the Turkish Mocha.The finish of the coffee is good, no acidity and made well, though we had to let our cool a bit to get the full effect. The baklava was also amazing. Usually this kind of dessert is too sweet and covered in syrups that ooze out. Not this time. These were made very well, were flaky and not too sweet. A good match to our coffees.What really made our experience though is Sam. He came off a bit edgy in the beginning, but as he talked to us we felt more and more that he really just loved his coffee and his store and just wanted to share it with us in his own way.

Sightglass,"TLDR: Go to Blue Bottle or Philz for better coffee, service, and pet-friendly staff. Most workers here treat their coffee better than their customers. Sightglass, never forget who's serving whom.I enjoy Sightglass coffee, but had an extremely disappointing experience yesterday when I used the Ritual app for the first time to pick up an order. I wasn't warned that your shop was not pet-friendly, so I walked my dog there and thought I could pop in to quickly grab my order. Upon seeing the no pets sign, I asked your barista if someone could grab my order upstairs since no pets are allowed inside. Instead of giving a direct answer, he told me to speak with your production team. A young woman in production said no dogs allowed, but she could grab my order. She asked for my name and what service I ordered through. When she found out it was for Ritual, she said I had to pick it up myself and told me to tie my dog outside. In SF, when anything left on the sidewalk is fair game, I wasn't about to risk losing my dog for coffee. So I asked her again if she could allow a one time courtesy since I wasn't notified about the no pet policy. She rudely said, ""No we're busy working"".1. When it comes to working, wouldn't you say that serving customers would be your team's highest priority? And if her task was too urgent/important, couldn't she have politely phrased her response? 2. I asked her to simply grab my order upstairs, but she treated me like I was a homeless person begging in some fancy establishment. No coffee, no matter how delicious, is worth risking my dog over or being treated so poorly. It's JUST COFFEE. I demand compensation and an apology for such a terrible experience.

Wrecking Ball Coffee,"While visiting the Marina District, we were so thrilled to stumble upon this gem of a coffee shop. They have friendly employees, fast service, and amazing, high quality beans. Being from Sacramento, we love our Temple, Pachamama, Insight, etc. coffee roasters, and now we have a new SF roaster to add to our favorite Bay Area coffee companies. This shop has a very small interior. You can push a single stroller into it down the narrow entryway (yes, parents really need their coffee!), but space is very limited. We gladly took our coffee to go, because it was fun to sip our drinks and stroll down Union Street, exploring the different shops.If you decide to get your coffee ""for here,"" there's a small counter bar you can sit at and watch any hand pours that they make. There is also a bench along the entryway and a few chairs out front. We came twice, it was that good. Our first trip was in the afternoon and our second visit was in the morning. In the morning, their pastry case was bursting with delightful looking treats, big and moist, and I'll have to come back to get one!We got some ""chocolate milk"" for our toddler, which was their house made chocolate sauce/base with some slightly-warmed and frothed milk, and it was a delightful treat!I got a cappuccino on both visits because it was perfection. The perfect ratio of milk to espresso, and their espresso is amazing!! They poured beautifully-designed hearts in the milk foam on top too.

When I asked for the heavy cream, the junior barista helpfully brought it out. At which point the senior barista threw a fit, declared that the heavy cream (a full half-gallon) was for the ""children's hot-chocolate only"" and refused under all circumstances to let me have a splash. Only half and half was offered, and there are dietary reasons that I wanted full-fat cream instead of half-milk.I suppose that I could have demanded a refund on my Americano (none was offered) but I decided to leave it at that.

I love coffee so I've tried everything in their menu (don't worry, the options are limited) and personally it's just not my cup of coffee. ** I don't know if this is a legitimate complaint though, maybe it's me WiFi and outlets though is a legitimate complaint. They do at least have outlets in some of the seatings but still, I've found myself waiting for the spots to open up or leaving because I know my computer will die within the hour thus making $6 hot chocolate not worth it. WiFi is spotty, 75% of the time I come here I'm connecting to the complimentary hour xfinity WiFi or the whole foods one and between that, no outlet and refreshing my page like 50 times and then right before my computer dies , success!

Flywheel Coffee,"Came here for a study date and to be honest, we were not that impressed.For starters, when we were trying to order our drinks we were asking the barista for her opinion since we aren't big coffee drinkers and she was not very helpful. There were only 2 of them working but it was not busy enough to where they were slammed with orders, yet as we were trying to ask her questions to order, she kept going back and forth from the register and coffee maker and when asking about drinks, she was very blunt with no real explanation on the differences.

No outlets really around for one to charge their products, stools as seats for a majority of the tables, it's just not the ideal spot to get work done really.Giving two stars because they at least have outdoor seating, but even then, tables are super tiny, and the outdoor location is small itself too.Overall, this place could work for someone looking to take a quick drink of coffee and check ema",2.0,2019-03-14,0.6166666666666667,0.42513227513227514,0.17133333333333334,0.893,0.21,-0.7303,NEGATIVE,0.9999843835830688,46.61,19.1,8.49,24.0,8.09,25,7th and 8th grade,46.61,19.1,14.0,8.09,1069

The espresso is flavorful and got a good amount of acidity/fruitiness and body.

Flywheel Coffee,"Nitro coffee is like my crack. It makes me vibrate in a way that no other caffeine product does. So on a Friday morning, when visiting my new nephew in San Fran, this was an excellent choice for a pick me up before heading to the awesome Golden Gate Park playground, just across the street.  The service was friendly, fast and kind.  There was a jovial and heartwarming conversation about a man's dog who had just had medical issues and was sweetly lying on the floor waiting for his owner. The server was genuinely interested in the man's story and the dog's recovery.The space is open and inviting. With enough spots to sit, but also the room to move around freely and get the items you've ordered without getting stuck in the flow of traffic.  I was able to get a vegan donut for my kiddo, who's allergic to dairy, and a pizza danish, which was weirdly amazing as a cross between a pastry and a slice of thin crust.I would saunter back to this spot in a heartbeat to get more morning ""get up and go juice"" anytime I'm in town!",5.0,2018-11-30,0.3001262626262626,0.5577272727272728,0.14800000000000002,0.802,0.270625,0.9672,POSITIVE,0.9999064207077026,57.88,14.7,7.85,18.3,8.01,30,7th and 8th grade,57.88,14.7,14.0,8.01,1029
Flywheel Coffee,"Flywheel is conveniently close to my workplace, so a few of us decided to make a stop after work.

My friend found it faster to use the nearby Whole Foods wifi instead.I'm not a coffee drinker, so I opted for the hot chocolate. My friend got the coffee and felt like it was solid. The hot chocolate however was mediocre at best. I was quite underwhelmed by the flavor, and felt that the overall chocolate taste was lacking in strength. The hot chocolate was also lukewarm, and I expected better quality for the price.Overall, Flywheel seems like a reasonable place to meet up with friends, or take a little change of environment by studying / working at a coffee shop.

Flywheel Coffee,"I came in to meet a friend for coffee. Upon entering there was no greeting from the baristas, which I was fine with since they were making drinks. Being this was my first time here, I had no idea what to order, what their drink menu was or what the ordering process was like. I walked up to the counter and saw the iPad facing towards me and I thought maybe I'm suppose to just order it myself. I figured if I had to wait to order that the barista who was less than a foot away from me and the ipad would say ""I'll be right with you"" or something along the lines of that. Since he did not say anything, I made an assumption that maybe I was suppose to order through the iPad since I have been to places that have an iPad ordering station. Since the iPad was already facing me, I looked to see what they had besides what was written on the wooden menu on the back wall. When the barista finally came over to me and he gave me a dirty look before he pushed the iPad towards himself to ask for my order.  I asked if they could make a vanilla latte considering  the menu had latte is an option. The barista said, ""we don't have syrups"" in a rude response because he was obviously irritated that I look at the iPad and almost proceeded to click the buttons to order myself.

Spike’s Coffees &,"Fantastic little cafe with a wide variety of coffees and eats. I came here in the afternoon with some friends while visiting SF and needed a quick caffeine fix-up and ordered a Cafe au Lait with soymilk as per advice from my coffee-loving Italian friend. Before ordering, I was allowed to same each different brew and decide which one I wanted in my drink. I had never tasted a soymilk based drink so smooth or clean-tasting in my life. Normally soy makes a pretty obvious substitution for milk, but this time I really enjoyed the slightly nutty flavor that it gave off. The pastries also looked excellent; my friends ordered an almond croissant and a lemon muffin which I nibbled off of. Both were decent.

Spike’s Coffees &,"It's been eleven long years since my first review of Spike's, and I was a gushing li'l Yelper at the time dramatically comparing the service one receives there to the feeling of being kowtowed at a high-end Japanese department store. Itadakimasu! Overstate much, Ed U.? Well, Jamie W. and I were back at Spike's after a long absence just because I was looking to have some hot liquid in my body after a brisk walk over the Swish Alps. It's still the same tiny place on 19th Street, but we take up less room so it didn't seem as claustrophobic on this visit. The service was pleasant enough but didn't seem that outstanding. Maybe I've gotten more crotchety over the years. I can cop to that. Get off my lawn!However, I did like the montage of dog photos which we stared at from the round table next to the front window (photo: bit.ly/2EwLqwY). This time, we took advantage of their robust tea selection (photo: bit.ly/2F9zMW6) and decided on a steeping $2.50 cup of Rooibos (photo: bit.ly/2C2YfNT). Jamie, never a fan of hot liquids, went with the $3 Ginger Peach Iced Tea. They offer all sorts of gummy candies, but we were good and stuck with our teas. We decided to replace our collective sweet tooth with subtle eavesdropping skills as we listened to an awkward blind date at the next table where the more interested guy kept laughing like a hyena at anything the other one said.

Saint Frank,"I'm not the biggest fan of coffee, but I went with my cousins because they're pretty into it. I'd say it's where I imagine hipsters going on a Saturday morning to get their daily boost of energy. COFFEE: The coffee itself was alright. Both of the ones we tried had a certain tang of bitterness to them that I wasn't really expecting with the ""apple spiced"" component. I didn't really get any of that flavor at all to be honest... If anything, I could tell that the flavor was rich and deep. The coffee beans that they use for sure have a different quality than your average Starbucks coffee. Despite this, I've had better cups of coffee for cheaper all around the Bay Area. SERVICE: It might not be the barista's fault, but some girl walked up after we had been waiting in line and asserted herself so she could get her cup first. I wish they had paid better attention to the order or had a more organized system of ordering, but it's alright.5/5 for that minimalist aesthetic and modern coffee shop vibe... 3/5 for the overall experience and taste.NOTE: This review is late, so the spiced apple latte was probably a part of their seasonal holiday menu.",3.0,2019-03-27,0.23113095238095244,0.4802028218694885,0.109,0.797,0.2173333333333333,0.9845,NEGATIVE,0.9715206027030945,67.18,9.1,7.83,10.3,6.79,28,7th and 8th grade,67.18,9.1,10.3,6.79,1153

Saint Frank,I brought my cousin here for the coffee flight while we were being cheesy SF tourists. It definitely seemed like a local coffee spot for coffee fanatics and it quickly got packed. They have really quality coffee and a few menu items. None of the sugary varieties at Starbucks which I appreciated. They also have a number of baked goods. We ordered the flight of course which comes with a preset 4 cups. It's actually quite a bit of coffee for one person. I ordered the vanilla latte. I'm not really a coffee person but it was good.

While we waited, I took in the cute little coffee shop- seating downstairs with charging spots for those who like to get work done, and another seating area upstairs (I imagine sans technology support to allow for conversation). The space is bright and welcoming, as was the barista who took our order. Clear from those in line ahead of me, and per the recommendation, the almond macadamia milk latte was the way to go! We ordered two, watched them being made (very cool preparation space and view), paid and were our the door in just minutes! As for the lattes themselves- the almond macadamia nut milk definitely adds a creaminess to the latte. The beans, themselves, I imagine are quite strong as, even with the milk, I felt them to be slightly more acidic on my stomach. Regardless, the drinks were delicious!

I thought that their order of doing things was really unique, but super cool. You first order from a barista (you just approach one of them and order). Once it's made, they call your name out and you pick it up, taste it for approval so they can change or add something if you don't like it (which was a wild concept to me), and then you take your coffee and you pay for it.

Philz,"Wasted $10 on a bad barista. And we tipped too because we were confident in top quality service from all of our years with Philz. In all our years of tesoras and mint mojitos (no joke, we've had these drinks dozens of times), this is the first Philz to ever make them wrong/poorly. At worst in other branches, they'll just be off by a little according to barista skill and nature. But this was just so off and disgusting. Both drinks were terribly watery. We always order iced. And this one was just mint water or mocha water with clumps of cream at the top. We always have a creamy top. This one was clumped up white bits floating st the top.We very understandingly and kindly brought it up to the barista quietly to avoid having them get in trouble especially in front of the line of customers. The barista had zero apology and blamed the ice. If Philz iced drinks would be watery as hell, I don't think they'd make iced drinks as it would be 10 grades below their standard quality. The barista was more ""oh"" like we were idiots rather than ""oh I'm so sorry I'll do better"". The barista made the drinks again and well, they were watery again. It was a nightmare as we tried to down our $10+ wasted dollars through sf.We purposely went to Philz that day instead of Starbucks because we wanted some high quality beverages and to indulge in something beyond basic Starbucks. Spending way over what we'd spend at Starbucks and for something so unbearable is just the worst. We kept saying to ourselves ""we shoulda just stuck to basic today"".And to reiterate, my friend has been getting mint mojitos and instagramming them all the time for years. We even looked back at the old posts. This mint mojito looked like a disaster--like an earthquake hit sf and the water exploded into a cup and ingredients fell into the cup as well and sat for 5 days and then was served.I've had an iced mocha tesora for years--it is my go-to drink. I know what it tastes like. This version wasn't even a variation or slight shift of quality (which can be expected between branches). It was so beyond off that someone that didn't know how to brew could have attempted it blindfolded and still made it better. Worst Philz experience ever.

I am lactose and I definitely don't like almond milk in my coffee (it completely changes the taste) and soy milk can be a little too thin and watery. Oat milk is so much thicker, so much tastier and it's better for the environment. I ordered a latte with oat milk, there are no real sizes here - the drinks on the board come out as a ~grande size unless you order a cortado (which is inherently smaller).

We were lucky to find the last couple of seats in this super cozy spot, and by the time our food was ready a line had formed out the door.The avocado and burrata toast was absolutely delicious! My eyes must have grown to the size of golf balls when I first laid them on it. Fresh is best and fresh it was, the handful of arugula with the creamy burrata on the very thick toast had me savoring every bite.There were so many other great looking and smelling brunch items, coffees and pastries I gazed at as they passed over the counter.

Neighbor’s,"I hesitated to write this review because I don't want this place to get over-run but this place is seriously a gem. I also am so surprised that I never knew about this place and I used to live three blocks away--I guess it really flies under the radar! I am a huge fan of Andytown and their Snowy Plover so knowing that I didn't need to drive all the way to the Outer Sunset to get my caffeine fix was an amazing realization.The cafe is located in the residential area in Castro/Noe...you know the part where you have to climb the giant hill to get there and you wonder if your engine will actually make the crest at the top of the hill. What's nice about that is that there isn't as much foot traffic so it has a much quieter, chiller vibe. On a Saturday afternoon, there were actually some available tables--a crazy thought in San Francisco!They offer a variety of coffee options, including the famous Snowy Plover, and also some cool matcha options. The Snowy Plover mixes espresso, sparkling water, brown sugar syrup, and a generous dollop of salted homemade whipped cream. The result is perfectly balanced and refreshing coffee float. It's not overly sweetened like a lot of other coffee drinks so if you're a true coffee lover, don't worry it won't overpower the espresso itself. They also have several food options including Andytown's delicious scones (served with fennel honey whipped butter!) and also some more cafe-like options like avocado toast, etc. It also seems to double as a mini-market as there was a generous refrigerated section and also various goods being sold in a cute bookshelf (random items from Haribo gummy bears to handcrafted pottery--the theme was very unclear to me).My one qualm: wish they opened until 5 or 6 PM...although, they did recently extend their hours to 4 PM daily.",5.0,2018-09-29,0.24455492424242425,0.5545698924731183,0.231,0.755,0.22044444444444444,0.9954,POSITIVE,0.9998250603675842,56.32,13.3,9.76,16.6,7.85,53,12th and 13th grade,56.32,13.3,14.0,7.85,1811

I'm in town for business the morning before I had gotten some items and suffered a bit of sticker shock at the $15 for three items I got (latte, croissant, and a cold brew) but... it's San Francisco.

I went in for coffee and a croissant again. Steven asked me how I was... and while I love a social contract... I didn't have it in me. ""I'm pretty shitty actually...."" was my response. He cracked a pun or two about my star-covered dress and he was very sweet. When the latte was done I gave him my card. He pushed it back gently and said ""it's on me...

It seemed like a popular place since everyone around me was there working on their laptops, homework, or writing, which created a great working environment for me.

I also love matcha too so it was surprising that I didn't like it at all.I did like the minimalist decor and there were a lot customers there with their laptops enjoying their day.

Ballast,"I've been an irregular customer, as it were, since a couple of months after Ballast opened. I was not a habituee of the old joint that seems to have been beloved by many.  Even though I dig the space, I'd file this cafe under 'Hit or Miss'. I've had well-rendered drinks from (one of the) owner(s) who is there on and off. More often than not, I've had drinks made by folk who aren't actually up to snuff yet in the drinks-making department. This means, of course, that one is either spending four plus bucks on a good milk and espresso drink or not. And the latter scenario bunk. I mean, who likes paying to be a guinea pig? New hires learning how to make drinks on the job, i.e. drinks patrons are shelling out bucks for ain't kosher. (I understand that this is a somewhat common practice, but I still don't dig it.)The last time I was in Ballast, a new hire (the boss was training him while I was there, so I'm not guessing that he was newly employed) was making my capp while making small talk with the owner. I had wanted the boss to make the drink, but no such luck. I was hoping the new-hire wouldn't be distracted by the chat, but, given that the milk was overly hot and the espresso had a talc/tannic quality about it, it would seem that he had been. Dude set the drink on the saucer, gave not one glance at me, and, while still facing his boss, told him that he was unhappy with the foam art on my drink. I'm one foot over the counter from you, so why don't you not talk about how your drink doesn't measure up in front of patrons, or tell me directly. In all reality, I don't give a fig if you can make a feather or a heart or a gosh darn toy poodle in the foam. I do care that you don't scald the milk, do have the right grind, do have a machine that's been correctly calibrated, etc. It's substance over form all day long. If you can achieve both, then fab. If not then err on the side of the drink being balanced.  If you don't really care how your drink tastes or if you're not ordering espresso and milk drinks, then Ballast is a modern, tidy space you may well enjoy spending time in.**Back patio seating. **Tidy loo.",2.0,2018-12-11,0.2187830687830688,0.48414069264069276,0.14250000000000002,0.899,0.18857142857142858,0.9823,NEGATIVE,0.9992545247077942,80.75,8.0,6.04,10.4,6.25,37,7th and 8th grade,80.75,8.0,10.4,6.25,2134

Blue Bottle,"Blue Bottle Coffee itself I'd give 4 stars, but this specific location has its faults.There's a certain price I'm willing to pay for my daily cup of joe. $4.50 for a latte is comfortable. $5 is ""I'm not coming here everyday"" territory. Slap on that ""Healthy SF Surcharge"" and that $5 is now $5.20. Ok fine, 20 cents; I've already decided I'm not coming here every day but I'm fine contributing to these nice employees' healthcare costs. HOWEVER, ONLY THIS LOCATION ALSO CHARGES SF SALES TAX. So now that $5 latte is $5.62 and this officially became ""I'm only coming here because I'm desperate and it's the nearest coffee shop and/or everywhere else is already closed.""There is no fucking way I'm paying $5.62 for a latte every day, especially when there are so many other great options available in this neighborhood. SF is spoiled when it comes to excellent, locally roasted coffee, but this particular section of SoMa is as dense as it gets for top notch coffee options. Sightglass Coffee, Four Barrel at Pentacle Coffee, and Saint Frank are all within a few blocks radius for my daily, within-my-comfort zone fix. East SoMa may have all the new high rises, but you best believe West SoMa is coffee mecca.If you're not coming here every day and just want to check out the location, there a few cool perks (I know, complete mood switch lol):-17ft Ceiling Espresso - Most Blue Bottle locations serve their Hayes Valley Espresso by default. This location serves a special blend named after the specs of this Mint Plaza building. It's a subtle, delicious change especially if you drink Blue Bottle so often that you're almost toooo accustomed to the taste-Siphon Bar - At $8/$14, this is definitely not a daily cup of coffee thing lol. But if you're a coffee aficionado and appreciate the unique methods you can extract a lovely brew then this is something you definitely gotta try. Once(?) they had an extra special single origin coffee from Yemen for $20 so if you're really a bean seeker keep your eyes peeled. Only available between 8AM-2PM.-Nel drip - Blue Bottle has their own custom dripper that they use for most pour-overs, but they also do Nel drips for $10. This cool contraption produces an interesting, more viscous brew. Only 3oz so treat yo self.All things considered, I still come here but not as often  as I could because I drink way too much coffee and have to budget or else I'd be living wrecklessly.

Blue Bottle,"I was visiting SF for a week and I had to try this place out. I've heard of the brand and the 1000+ positive reviews sold it for me. When I got there, the line was out of the door and took about 10 minutes to pass through, so don't be intimidated by it. I got a Japanese style drip coffee. It was very thick and rich cold brew.

Blue Bottle,"Blue Bottle Coffee is what I hope to find in an urban coffee shop buried in San Francisco's South Of Market district. Turns out, Blue Bottle is a local chain, started in Oakland, now sprawling the globe with over 50 locations. Despite the mold, the store we walked into provided a first-time experience for us.The atmosphere is up-cycled industrial conversion, occupying a first floor corner space in an office building on Mint Plaza that reeks of story. The line for service was literally out the door when we walked up on a typically sunny, temperate San Fran Saturday morning. Always on the hunt for something new, we ordered New Orleans Cold Brew, a swirly mixture of milk and dark and smooth cold brew that was robust without being bitter. We both normally want to sweeten our coffee. But this brew was just so good, we didn't want to alter it in any way. We also tried a Siphon Coffee, something I'd never heard of. Apparently, it uses a Japanese-manufactured device that happened to be set up directly in front of where we sat. They heat the coffee to a specific temperature and brew it directly in the water in a flask straight from high school chemistry lab without a filter, skimming the grounds when they pour it out (see my pix). It's served in a beaker with cold water to clear the pallet between sips. I don't know how different it really was (I'm a bit too hoi polloi to perceive the distinction). But, it was fun and unusual. The barista who made it for us was informative and kind enough to answer all my Siphon-newb questions.We also ordered Avocado Toast, which was exceptional. But, center stage was the coffee. High marks for service, experience, atmosphere, quality, and variety. If there was a Blue Bottle near me, I'd hit it all the time.

B,"I came here super excited to try their croissant after reading the reviews on it because I love alomond croissants so much (the almond paste) and I was craving sweet stress foods after finals. There were two kinds of almond croissants available that day: chocolate banana almond and raspberry almond croissant and honestly I wanted to try the raspberry almond but because of the numerous reviews on the chocolate banana one I bought it without question even though I don't really like sweet fudgy chocolate stuff I'm more of a dark chocolate kind of person. YUM: The croissant was crunchy, warm, and gooey but I didn't really like the chocolate inside. I can tell why people love it though. But I came for the sweet, yummy almond paste I love and the chocolate and banana were clearly the main thing in this croissant masking any almond paste that regular almond croissants have(if there even was any). Really love the texture of the croissant though, I enjoyed every bite. I will definitely come back to try other flavors. $4.50 is a little pricey but again it's B patisserie and the croissant was satisfying. REGRET: I did regret spending my money on this flat thing called an arlette though. It was way too sweet; just a flat crunchy churro basically with way too much surface area covered with cinnamon sugar. That $3 could've been better spent on another croissant. I only bought it out of curiosity, asking a worker what is this? and I asked her if it was good and she said oh it's SO good. I am too easily convinced. I will be back to try a different croissant though!

Of course there was a line when I went Saturday at 4 pm but it moves quickly, although several items were out (I really wanted a chocolate croissant).The Kouign Amann was ridiculous and clearly the best pastry item I had. In my friend's words, ""they've got their pastry crunch and flake game on point,"" and I wholeheartedly agree. Next time I'm just going to stuff my face with as many Kouign Amann I can afford to buy ($4.25 each yo).The tartine was $11, and when I went to eat it at a nearby park, the wind may or may not have blown the takeout box so that the mushroom and cheese fell onto the grass while I was trying to take a picture of it (key word being *trying*).

UpForDayz,"So, this place looks different from the normal Valencia vibe, and I get that. But! The food and drinks are right for the commute vibe. I had a turmeric latte that was delicious (and caffeinated, fyi) and the OMG sandwich--which is open faced. The sandwich is good. It's minimalist (avo, boiled egg, olive oil, pomegranate seeds, and salt) but had a vibrant, pleasant taste at each bite. Salted just right. They have donuts: maple glazed, chocolate glazed, chocolate w/ rainbow sprinkles. I am so thankful to have donuts in the neighborhood again. And, no offense, they're finally not vegan. If you're one of those people who like to sit and stare at your computer, they have tables for that.

Jane on,"Wow. Idk why it took so long for me to finally come here. But that first time changed EVERYTHING cause now I'm here ALL THE TIME. This place is my vibe - healthy, quality, hip vibin' foodMy favs:- Egg white sandwich: egg whites, spinach, provolone sriracha, and avocado on your choice of bread. I've gotten it on the (award winning) baguette and on the sourdough. I prefer it on the sourdough because I LOVEEE sourdough. If I had to eat one food for the rest of my life, it would probably be sourdough...and they really know what they're doing with their sourdough!! Follow the head baker at Jane (Jorgen Carlson @instajorgen) on Instagram for pictures of beautifully proofed loaves of bread...drooling rn scrolling through these pictures wow (pro tip: ask for extra sriracha on the side in addition to what's on the sandwich if you want even more of a kick...they don't leave the sriracha bottles out like Jane on Larkin does)- Salted white chocolate oat cookie: OMG. THIS COOKIE. I run a lot. Last marathon training cycle, this cookie would be my post long run tradition. This is the best cookie I've ever had. Oatmeal raisin and white chocolate macadamia are two of my favorite cookies, and Jane has taken these and made something EVEN MORE AMAZING. The cookie is kinda crispy on the outside and has the greatest, chewy center. Chewy but not too chewy. I could eat cookie after cookie after cookie. IT'S SO DELICIOUS. Sometimes I'll line up and wait to order and see that there are only 2 of them left and the line will be really long and I'll get so anxious that someone is going to take them. MY COOKIE. MINEEE. BACK OFF. Hangry runner here- Iced latte with oat milk: The espresso is so strong but not too strong!! Bold but smooth. But I don't get this as much anymore because they switched oat milk brands from Oatly to Califia...nothing compares to Oatly. NOTHING. But sometimes I'll bring my own Oatly and order a double shot of espresso over ice and pour it inBottom line: Such a cute place!!

Jane on,"Finally visited with a friend and can happily say that I understand the hype around this place! Their food looks and tastes so good, they have a ton of vegetarian options, and most things on the menu are relatively healthy.Food:- Avocado mash ($9) came with a LOT of avocado. I think they seasoned it pretty well, too!- Smoothie bowl ($9) surprised me because it wasn't super sweet. It was also a tad more watery than other smoothie bowls I've had, but I liked it! Might not be for everyone, though.- Latte ($5) was standard.Price:Some of the menu items seemed overpriced, but it's what you'd expect from a super popular cafe. You could theoretically get a breakfast for under $10 (coffee + pastry/quiche, or one breakfast item) since portions are pretty generous, but I wanted to try everything. :)Service:Friendly and speedy! They give you numbers after you order and bring your food to your table. My group got our food after ~7 minutes.Ambiance:The downstairs area is really cute, but they don't allow laptops in the mornings at some of tables, limiting you to either high tables near the cash register (which gets really loud with all the traffic) or the upstairs (which isn't as nice).

The pate was like a spread with a consistency like hummus, but a graininess like almond butter.

Again, the server came back saying that it wasn't possible to make that salad because the lentils were mixed into the arugula. At this point it's abundantly clear that they are not making the salads fresh and are either using packaged mixes or mixing them before hand. And because you've paid at the register, you're essentially forced to keep your order at the same price as your original order. I was finally able to get another salad which wasn't one I wanted at all. The salad was extremely mediocre. AND they never brought out my macchiato that I had already paid for. As this was my first time eating in, I didn't know that we had to pick it up at the bar.

Ritual Coffee,"College student here and I always come to this cafe but the baristas are unfriendly and inattentive. When asking a question, I was told by one of the baristas to ""order at the register"" and I was asked if I ""can wait,"" which I gladly agreed. This is my THIRD time at this cafe and the service depends on the person. The coffee is a solid 7/10 and I've ordered their lattes, but I feel like it depends on the person who is making them. Once I had a latte in which the espresso was still sitting at the bottom and the milk was at the top! Also, I typically order almond milk and on one occasion, the barista had forgotten. Because of a milk allergy, I found out that day by feeling sick, which was honestly not fun.One thing that they have never done was ask for my name for my drink. Also, it would be nice too if some of the baristas didn't try to ring up customers as quickly as possible.... Ironically, they often they treat older customers with more respect, attention, and patience. It is unfortunate, because I have plenty of younger friends who would have enjoyed coming here FOR THE COFEE. However, with service this disappointing, I hope this review serves as a warning to fellow students.If you are a young 20-something or go to University of San Francisco nearby, please please please, I urge you to go elsewhere for coffee!

Got a tomato bagel with swish cheese with you guessed it NO flavor. Wish I had salt and pepper in my car.

Blue Danube Coffee,"I've never written a Yelp review. Even though I signed up years ago. This is my first. But today I was inspired. Really inspired. Not by the coffee or the tea, or the food - but by a girl (woman). I'm what you call a ""die hard, old school romantic"". I always have been. You can thank my Southern grandfather. And this post might not even make it to the review section. But I met the most beautiful woman here today standing in line, with an equally beautiful and engaging personality. Skin dark, brown and smooth and fine like silk. And yes, She was ""Fine"". And when she smiled it was as if there was no-one else here. Her skin and smile - flawless. She was dressed very casually. Like you would on a Saturday afternoon in the bay when your running errands. We engaged in some very small talk while in line. And for whatever reason, I was not my normal cool self. This woman had me stuttering. Yep. I was nervous. After the small talk we sat down on separate sides of the coffee shop. And I couldn't help but look at her and think how do I get over to her and introduce myself, after all - she was eating her meal and reading a book and I didn't want to intrude. SO I decided to write her a handwritten note. Yep, told you I was an old school romantic. Now, how was I going to deliver it? Well, after about 30 minutes she got up and walked by me - I said ""excuse me"". And from there I engaged her in more conversation - however, this time there was more depth to it. She is smart, witty, and maybe even appreciated my goofy nerdyness. I handed her the letter. She smiled. and she said ""I will read it later"". She could of left after that - but she didn't. She stayed another 5 or 10 minutes.  Good sign? I guess. In the letter, I left my cell and email. Now I wait. For love? A new friend? who knows.So if I must leave a review for the Blue Danube here it is. The green tea tasted like an elixir of love. Magical. (yeah, I'm corny too, I know). Because when I was talking to her, anything I drank here would be magical. I love the chill atmosphere because it made it easy for me to engage her in a conversation. And to top it all off today the music playlist was classic rock from the 70s!!! the soundtrack of my childhood. I've been here 4 hours and I've heard The Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, Carly Simon, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Boston, ya feeling me yet? All the classics! The music that got me started playing guitar and the music that I play to this day - Still, everyday. It was just incredible all the way around. These are the type of cafes I miss living in Detroit now. Cool, chill neighborhood joints. And we are across from one of San Francisco's Iconic restaurants. Burma Superstar. The staff here was super cool. Hey, maybe its just the ""love bug"" LOL! Cause everything about this place was what you expect from a great local coffee shop. I saw a few complaints about the WiFi and the $2 cost. I get it. We all want and expect free WiFi while sipping our lattes and green teas. I have a personal hotspot on my phone for occasions like this. Everyone doesn't. So thank you Blue Danube. I came here by accident today, but did I really? Is there such a thing as an accident? I met a beautiful woman here today who I may or may not ever hear from again.

Castro Coffee,"I've never gotten coffee here. Unbelievable, I know. After all, I've bought the chocolate-dipped appendage on a stick that I lustfully yet respectfully dubbed Mandingo at Hot Cookie, wolfed down the overaccessorized wieners at Dapper Dog, and attended the most essential sing-alongs at the Castro Theater. Besides, I'm a Philz guy who becomes a creature of redundant habits. But I had never been here until I found myself in the Castro early on a weekday morning with a few minutes to spare before a medical appointment up the street.What deterred me is the claustrophobic space and the number of tourists and regulars who venture in but don't seem to come out. On this particular morning, it was almost empty which allowed me to get a pleasing 20-ounce cup of the Hawaiian Royal Kona coffee for just $2.15 (photo: bit.ly/2PJ1Nsg). It gave me a gulp of the tropics before my EKG and motivated me to come back to buy a bag of their beans. They spotlighted at least five different types that morning which I presume they rotate. I was just thinking how good a cup of the Geisha Esmeralda would go with a Mandingo.COFFEE - 4 stars...smooth richness with a different flavorAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...still feels tight in here but I can bear it nowSERVICE - 4 stars...awfully nice considering how long they must be in there every dayTOTAL - 4 stars...indie coffee that worked for meRELATED - Hanging around in the Castro?

YakiniQ,"As someone who has been a barista at a very busy coffeeshop, this is going to be quite a critical and unapologetic review. Thankfully SF has a lot of other coffee shops so when I say this one is never getting my business again, I mean it. This is the worst cafe I've been to in SF. Spotty wifi, rude staff, mediocre beverages and sub-par food. Overpriced because it's in SF, but nothing to justify the cost. My friend felt overtly uncomfortable with the way the counter spoke to us. Their baked goods, or at least their cookies, are stale and old. As soon as I ordered one, it fell on the ground and I asked for a replacement. Now in a general cafe, good customer service calls for replacing the purchase. When I asked for a replacement, the Russian (or Ukranian) barista rudely stared and said ""well that's not really our problem."" I stood my ground, and she replaced it- but what is it worth if it's stale (and old). The two baristas have such a tense relationship- one who's stressed out and the other who is meek.

Without thinking much, each of us got a drink and seated ourselves.Two of us casually mentioned the cake to the owner and we got 'no' as response, we also got 'you can sit outside if you want to have the cake' . It was raining very heavily and we really wanted to have the cake so I decided to see if there is some room for negotiation. It turned out to be a one-way negotiation really because I was offering anything I could think of: service fee; buying the dessert from the cafe first; not using their plate; being low-key by not taking photos or talking loudly, just going to a corner and quietly have the cake...I got nothing. She kept saying it's because they sell dessert and this is a cafe policy (there was no sign or listed anywhere). In the end she even said I'm irritating her! While I do respect policies from places, I don't think being rigid and inhospitable is the best idea to run a business. If she said the policy was based on a health code, I think I would have let it go because at least I can think that she cares about my health.

YakiniQ,"""Nothing is as far away as one minute ago..."" The Time Machine...During my college days, back in the 1890's, I was voted Big Man on Campus. I drove the latest unicycle, styled the latest handle-bar mustache,  and strutted in the latest leather corsets, the true example of Victorian era manhood. Oh and btw, I also really enjoyed independent coffee & tea shops. Y'know without a chain dangling around its neck!Fast forward to the present and I find myself no longer the Victorian Big Man on Campus, or do I fit in the latest slim faux corsets of today. Fortunately independent coffee & tea shops have survived time and I still wander from shop to shop in search for that special memory. But enough about dapper me..On a recent visit to Japantown, San Francisco, I'm hit with one of those wandering moments. I find myself in search of something new... I peruse my Yelp app, and... a ""tea café"" with a funny name... YakiniQ Café! Sounds like a place to mingle with full figured Victorian women looking to Mazurka!YakiniQ Café is located on Post Street directly across of the Hotel Kabuki. As I was about to enter YakiniQ BBQ... I realized it wasn't the tea café! So just be aware there's a BBQ restaurant with the same name, lol. I later found out that both are run by the same owners. So I enter the correct door on my second try... YakiniQ Café! It's very inviting and bustling with flesh. I was kindly greeted by the youngsters. I also noticed that the majority of patrons were college students, not from the 1890's like I expected, but young and fresh student types! So I quickly peruse the menu and the Yuzu Lemon Iced Tea is calling my name! I add the organic Banana Bread just cause. Sounds healthy. I then try to find a seat in the large ""study"" area filled with communal tables and café tables. Yet with all the eclectic seating options it was annoyingly hard to find a seat! I then noticed a rocking chair...yes, a rocking chair... just waiting for me in the corner! :3 I slowly settle into my rocking chair and start sipping my Yuzu Lemon Iced Tea...oh my so thirst quenching! The organic Banana Bread was just ok. The star of the show was the Yuzu drink and the Vaudeville act rocking in his chair.... time flies, Son! In the end, I recommend YakiniQ Café to anyone into cafes! Yet you might be disappointed with the limited menu and how crowded it can get! It's a popular spot for today's generation.

It's my favorite spot in San Francisco to work or study. They have more than enough seats and when you walk in everyone is so productive. It's quiet and relaxing and peaceful, and I am focused when I come here so I always feel good when I leave because I get a lot done! The atmosphere is super chill and the music is relaxing, most of the time instrumental. It's not necessarily a place to socialize. The food is slightly overpriced but they have a good variety of food from sandwiches and salads to teas and macaroons and pastries. The restrooms are gross, that's my only complaint. There's also a YakiniQ restaurant that's next door and I think by the same owner. It's right in the middle of Japan town so the location is also superb.

Then we trying to explain to her we did ordered something, she turned around and used her back to facing to us and trying to pretend she heard nothing! very mean and rude!

YakiniQ,"This place right here is something I love and hate sometimes. Lately, it's been more on the dislike side. I say that is because one time I took a bite into my beef brisket and it just tasted old or rotten. Like I immediately spat it out cause it just tasted sour. Another thing I personally don't like is the meat, a lot of it is frozen. You can tell it's not fresh once so ever, so personally that's how I kinda got that taste of the old meat. What I mean by frozen, is that the meat is not thawed out, they cut it frozen still.  Not to mention, the servers don't really check up on you. Sometimes have to flag another person down, which I truly dislike cause I know they didn't sit us down so it's really not their responsibility to help us. Then there some of the rude servers where they will personally cut up your meat for you outta nowhere and serve it onto your plate. I don't like that because I like my meat cooked a certain way and the last time they did this, they didn't check that one side wasn't throughly cooked. I really hate roasting a company but people gotta know the experience.I think the only thing I would say about the place that's a positive is the price is reasonable but if you go for the 2nd price which gets you more meat, definitely not worth it. I rather go to GEN if that's the case of paying more. The portion size is good as well.

YakiniQ,"I don't like writing bad reviews, but this one was unavoidable.Service: TERRIBLE. Staff are unhappy & unhelpful. Dine-in customers have to pick up their own drinks from the counter, but for a certain few, they give special service and actually serve them at the table. My own experience: I observed several customers leaving cups at their tables and staff subsequently collected them, so I did the same. But on the way out, I was approached and in an irritated tone, told to bring my cup to the front and put it in the dirty dishes bin. In a cafe now devoid of customers save for two, this struck me as odd. Being directed to put away the cup for them showed me nothing more than laziness. I pointed out that something like that is NOT the customer's job and it is absurd we'd be expected to do that for them, especially considering the place was nearly empty and nothing was holding them back from doing it themselves (and they did it for others, so why not me?). She stared at me indignantly and was like, ""okay then, I guess I'll do it MYSELF"". Wtf! They even kicked out a girl who was sitting there but didn't buy a drink. This alone is enough to make me never come back, but add to that the drinks are overpriced and not even good. The sweet potato one is just awful. In general, nothing special: I kept telling myself 'this time it will be nice' and every time I found myself thinking I could have made it better at home, and for way cheaper. They're even more expensive than Starbucks or Peet's, PLUS they don't tell you what added costs there are unless you ask. Extra costs for flavoring, for a different type of milk, or for anything that is not just the ""basic"" one. Before you know it, one cup of coffee is $6-7.So what are we as customers paying for? They're not nice, they don't serve you, they give you dirts for not doing their job for them. Due to their opportune location, the customers I have noticed are very nice and considerate.

Equator,"I finally had a chance to check out Equator Coffees & Teas and it did not disappoint. In fact, it may have sparked a new obsession. I ordered a batch brew, which was made from the 'Equator Blend.' I really liked it -- medium roast, smooth, and not too acidic of an aftertaste. It was reminiscent of Philz Tesora Soul, which is one of my favorites. I ended up buying whole beans of the same blend, so I'll be excited to make it at home as well. I thought that the prices were fair -- $2.75 for a 10oz. cup and $15.50 for a 12oz. bag of whole beans. They also stock limited quantities of special batches, which would bump the price range more toward $5-6/cup and $20-25 for a bag. Based on their standard selections, the limited batches are likely worth it and I plan to give them a try next time. Moreover, even if you are not a coffee drinker, they appeared to offer ample selection by way of loose-leaf teas.Things of note: you need to enter the Linkedin lobby in order to access the cafe and be prepared for a 10-15 minute wait in line if you go during lunch. Some major attributes of Equator are that it is a female-owned enterprise and it is a B-Corp, which means it should ideally be able to transparently report on social or environmental returns.

Hands down. It is just the right amount of sweetness but not too sweet. The oak milk gives it a nice nutty flavor but still keeps it pretty light, definitely not too nutty. This is a must try!Banana bread: The banana bread here is super yummy and a great snack for when you need something to hold you over until your next meal :)Veggie Scone: As someone who generally craves savory and warm snacks, this was a great find.

It felt like I was walking into an art museum that had a little coffee counter. A little strange, but there was quite a bit of open seating so I ordered a latte and sat down at one of the long counters to charge my laptop and phone. The guy who took my order was super friendly and polite. The latte was good, pretty standard. The price was also not too expensive for the area, I thought.

Lol, I did ask the smoker to move and they did... yet besides that the atmosphere is inviting. I would've given 5 stars yet the gal at the sandwich board was meticulous yet incredibly slow paced at placing of all things on the sandwiches, making it take very long.

Slightly borderline OCD...but what do I know I'm not a doctor yet I have worked in a Deli for years and waiting for half hour -forty five minutes didnt seem like a feasible turnover for deli food. Also, when I got my sandwich it didn't have bacon on it... I said I had asked for it. She said it doesnt come on the sandwich, I said check the ticket.  Then she toasted some bacon to put on the sandwich to make for a longer anticipatory wait... all while there was bacon on top the toaster (I'm assuming ready to be consumed or maybe it was burnt). I dont know... youd think being meticulous youd also pay attention to detail like what's on the ticket. My sandwich was good nonetheless... and the side salad was also great. I got a Turkey & Jack, which had avocado and arugula on it. Their restroom is nice and the barista/cashier was easy on the eyes and very helpful.

Additionally, I brought left overs from lunch and wasn't able to go home and had nowhere to put it and was told in a condescending manner that I could not bring outside food, even if I wasn't going to eat it. Their reasoning was that it would stink up the place, which I think is such a minor reason to make a big deal out of. It was at that moment I felt unwelcome. 3.

One of the best I've had. I also ordered their poptart-like pastry. Ask the staff for their recommendation and they said the one with brown sugar filling (other options were apricot and Nutella). Not worth the money at all. It looks cute, but it didn't taste like anything. Couldn't really taste the brown sugar. The only delicious thing about it was the crust. Service: All of them were just chilling. They were helpful but seems uninterested. It might be because it's two days before Thanksgiving? Back to the point, I asked them to heat up my pastry. One of them put it on the grill and literally forgot about it. It took about 20 minutes for another staff to noticed it, looked a little confuse, and then yell out the order.

Urban,"Seeing various Instagram posts about Urban Ritual's matcha toffee made me stop by the Hayes Valley neighborhood to try this drink. Literally. It's a decent-sized boba shop with a couple of tables and a U-shaped bench for seating. I had my eyes set on the matcha toffee and my boyfriend was curious as to what drinks he should try. I mentioned that their creme brulee is one of their popular drinks, so he decided to order it with boba. He couldn't adjust the sugar for this drink, but it was actually not too sweet. It's rich and has bits of the creme brulee pudding & caramelized sugar in it. He pointed out that the boba was a bit on the hard side, though.The matcha with oat milk is really good with 50% sweetness (75% is their default, I think). They use Jade Leaf Matcha and you can tell that the quality of the matcha is creamier than most. Unfortunately, I wish I could taste more of the toffee flavor. There was a huge clump of it on the bottom of my drink after I finished it. Maybe I should have a) stirred it more thoroughly and/or b) order with less ice?

The milk tea had a strong tea flavor, which is what I always look for, and the custard inside my tea made it really rich and creamy. Their creme brulee custard is also made in house, which I really liked.It had a simple yet aesthetic interior, good for studying or 1:1 milk tea dates.

But, both the owners questioned the staff member in front of customers and proceeded to tell her that they don't need employees like that working for them.

Especially in a neighborhood of high quality establishments where you can get bread (tartine, thorough) and coffee (tartine, ritual, etc!). The decor inside doesn't remind me of Berlin or Germany at all. They seem to have WiFi which was annoying bc it's a small place and the laptop loitering makes seating hard if you're stopping by for a snack. In all fairness, they serve andytown and their espresso-based drinks are good. I would come back for a coffee but wouldn't be the one to recommend it since their drip coffee is a medium roastI am definitely not coming back for food and would lobby very vocally against eating here.

There is just such good energy in this coffee shop, Aesthetics very crisp and welcoming, the service is amazing, and the coffee is so wonderful especially on a nice sunny day. A lot of their pastries are pastries you would not find typically in America. I had one of their soft boiled eggs with muesli and it was very delightful. It's also very quiet inside and you can do a lot of work inside if you need to. I just love all of the German decorations as well.

I was pretty excited to come back and show him this cute spot, but unfortunately had a ""lesser quality"" of an experience than before. The woman who took our order today had zero patience with us and zero warmth, which was odd because we just got to the counter. We couldn't tell if she was giving us sass or just naturally rough around the edges, but every interaction with her felt like we were inconveniencing her day despite it not being busy.She seemed annoyed when I wanted to clarify the price of our two coffees, then forgot to give us one coffee so I had to ask her male co-worker. She yelled for us to get the second coffee at the counter when I noticed her co-worker dropped off food and beverages he took orders for to tables. When my husband asked for the wifi he didn't quite hear right and went back and she coldly said ""It's right here. Look at it."" and walked away to the back. On top of that, I couldn't help but note she never asked if we wanted our order to go or not, and she didn't ask if I wanted my pastry heated up like I got last time I was there (which I loved!). We got our coffees in to go cups and my pastry in a bag automatically.

I brewed the first one right when I got home. Before brewing it I noticed it smelled really strange, it smelled almost like hemp! I figured it was perhaps from the wooden bin they were stored in.

Folklores Coffee,So i went to grab a coffee yesterday and the place looks nice but the coffee quality is not like before. I really miss the homey feeling that it had before. Not enough seating to enjoy your coffee or to do some work. The new guy tall skinny one is not that friendly at all no smile no nothing. It almost feel like every other cafe in San Francisco strictly business transaction. I missed the friendly service from the couple and their previous employee. The service i used to get every morning was the highlight of my day. I heard it's the same owner but a little birdie told me the wife is not there anymore. Shit i really liked the place but unfortunately it lost the quality or the service. Hopefully they come to their senses and bring back the old Zoll back.

It is on the pricier side, but it's definitely cause they use higher quality ingredients and you can tell! I came in around lunch time and ordered an iced honey latte made with soy as well as their avocado toast with a poached egg. This was probably the best avocado toasts I've ever had! I like how the avocado spread was still pretty chunky (which is how I like it) and it was seasoned perfectly with the coarse ground black pepper on top that added a nice little kick. The pickled red onions on top also added a good crunch and acidity that complimented the creaminess of the avocado very well. Do yourself a favor too and add the poached egg - it's an extra $2 but it's well worth it!

Verve Coffee,"Today was my first time in, a Sunday at 7am. I ordered two large coffees and 4 pastries. I was told the pastries were ham and gruyere on brioche...they were corned beef and cabbage (which I like normally but not for breakfast) and were soggy in the middle and stale on the outside. The almond croissants I ordered were stale and the filling tasted like thick sugary honey paste, not marzipan. I thought to myself, ""well at least I have coffee.""  When I was finally handed my two ""large"" coffees (that are the size of a Starbucks Tall) and was told my bill was $32, I just paid and walked out.  Two stars, not one, because the woman that waited on me was really friendly...despite complaining to me that no one tips her (which I did).  So disappointing.

Verve Coffee,"I have walked by Verve Coffee many times. I decided to visit today and try something. It's a different cafe with its own concept. It's minimal, but there's some different coffee drinks. I saw Americano and espresso, and that didn't appeal to me. I saw something called ""One and One"" and thought I would try it. It was an espresso shot and a macchiato shot. The macchiato shot was creamy and a small shot of coffee. The espresso was very sour and you had to drink it fast. This cafe is modern and comfortable to hang out in.

No, they serve milk teas and fruit teas, milk drinks and matcha, and cold brew coffee in a pretty small space on O'Farrell right on the edge of the 'Loin.

You DO NOT need to ask for the fancy cup, they simply ran out of their signature cups, but the guy at the register did assure me they're getting more in so whoever wrote that, shame on you. **Clearing the cup situation.

The space is extremely small. It can probably fit no more than 8 people comfortably so this is definitely the grab and go type of place. Drinks only come in one size which may be a downer for people who drink a lot of milk tea.I ordered three drinks to go for my 2-hour drive: Taro Matcha Latte, mango ML and the Black Sugar Fresh Milk all with boba. After 2 hours, I finally sipped on these and absolutely loved the Black Sugar milk tea (my fave). The mango matcha was also good with a nice balance of mango, milk and matcha. I wasn't a fan of the Taro. Maybe it was because I didn't drink it when it was freshly made, but the whole combo was not of my liking and the tapioca balls were a bit stale.

Equator Coffees &,"I'll start by saying that based on my brief interaction with the rude clientele (cutting in line then rudely justifying themselves); which I can't officially blame on the shop, other than as a general tone that they set and accept, this was my first and last visit to this establishment. Further, I found it odd that I ordered three chai teas ""to go"". The cashier acknowledged this but when they came up there were three cups sitting on the counter. No carrier, no tops...  just cups with liquid sitting there.  These were ""to go""? I asked the girl if I could have them ""to go please"", and she looked at me, dumbfounded, and answered ""they are"". So I asked again, in case she didn't quite hear me and got the same reply. So I specifically asked for a cup carrier, which there was a stack of behind her, as well as cup tops. ""Ok, here's a carrier"" she replied and handed it to me. She then pointed out the stack of cup tops on the counter between us. I know this is a little gripe in the big scheme of things, but I was frankly shocked at the blatant poor service about something that's generally a no-brainer. I always leave a buck or two in tip jars, but was happy not to this time. I might as well add that it was, in fact, the worst chai tea I've ever had. Bland in flavor, with tea leaves in the drink.

Saint Frank 2,"I have two coffee scoops at home. One is made of plastic and came free with my Hario V60 ceramic dripper. The other is metal and was purchased at Williams Sonoma when, as a graduate student, I was feeling flush with cash after my monthly stipend arrived. Most of the time, the luxury-model stainless steel scoop sits in the back of the cutlery drawer. It's smaller than the plastic one and takes three scoops to reach 25 grams of whole beans on my digital scale. The plastic scoop usually needs just one. Occam's Razor - the caffeinated kind, mind you - in action.But then I met Frank. When I brought my first bag of ""las Nieblas"" home, I rummaged around the cutlery drawer for the metal coffee scoop. I carefully cleaned my Zassenhaus manual grinder by running some uncooked rice grains through it and wiping it clean with an organic cotton cloth. I reread the pourover chapter in Grounded: The Fundamentals of Brewing a Delicious Cup of Coffee (2018). It was just before sunrise on a Saturday in early May. Quietly, so as not to wake my companion sleeping in the other room, I lit an oak fire in the fireplace. I put Disc 1 of ""The Definitive Vince Guaraldi"" on the stereo. I got my digital timer and scale ready. I measured and ground 25 grams of coffee and poured 400 grams of just boiled, charcoal filtered water into the dripper. A hand-thrown ceramic mug was pre-warmed and ready. Over the sink, I did a high pour into the mug so that a beautiful bunch of coffee bubbles formed on top. I walked to the hearth and took my first sip as the crackle of burning wood accompanied ""Cast Your Fate to the Wind"" on the stereo. A dense fog was rolling in off the Pacific, and the redwoods were dripping steadily as a golden-hued early morning light began to brighten the room. I stood in front of the fire sipping that cup of ""las Nieblas"" until it was completely empty. I almost never do that in one sitting. It was me, Vince, the fire, the redwoods, and the fog. In a million years, you will not get any more ""Saint Frank"" than that.What would Uvaldo Moreno have said if I had measured out his magical beans with a scoop made of mere plastic? Or sipped it from a dirty travel mug with the scent of past pourovers still in it? Señor Moreno would not have been pleased, nor his two sons, Milton and Alexi, whose coffee parcels are named ""las Nieves"" (""the snow"") and ""las Nubes"" (the clouds"") and also are roasted here at Saint Frank.How do I know all this? Because Saint Frank told me! It's all on the cards with pictures of the coffee parcels from which the beans have been harvested. I didn't just buy a bag of freshly roasted coffee beans that day. It's more like I adopted them, like in those old TV ads for Save the Children.Ever heard of an heirloom coffee varietal called Parainema? Me neither! That's because it's probably unique to only one section of Santa Barbara Mountain, Honduras. You can try that one, too. It's called ""la Laguneta"" (""the lagoon""). Benjamin Paz grows that one. Saint Frank buys it directly from Benjamin and ships it to San Francisco, where it's roasted here in SoMa. Plus a bunch of other single origin coffees, each with their own personalized backstory and ""mud to mug"" micro-narrative.  Even the espresso machine here - an Italian made custom VA 338 ""Black Eagle"" - has a backstory. It won a recent U.S. Barista Championship. That's right: the exact machine. Not the model! The actual machine that won it. It's like having your honey lavender latte made by Mary Lou Retton. That croissant you're eating? Jane made that. Jane who? Jane the Baker, obviously. Haven't you been paying attention to Saint Frank and his spiritually-tinged planetary mission ""to inspire joy, connection, and meaning in coffee with simplicity and courtesy""?I don't know exactly what ""fourth wave"" coffee culture would look like. But Saint Frank ain't no third wave wanna-be. Maybe in Menlo Park, where Facebookers can slurp up ""the Fog,"" ""the Snow,"" and ""the Clouds"" in a single sitting while trolling your latest posts for harvestable data. Or on Polk Street, where Saint Frank's original cafe is still located. But this here is a roastery. Customers do not come first. The coffee does. If it feels a bit like an artisan's workshop, that's because it is. The fact that you can even sit down while you drink is a major perk. Purchase a 12oz. bag of beans to go ($19-21), and they'll throw in a complimentary cup of filtered drip - your choice.Except that you can't drink it in front of an open fireplace with redwood rain falling on the rooftop. Unless you actually happen to be Uvaldo Moreno or one of his sons. Then, you are welcome to join me for an early morning fireside pourover. I'll make it for free and serve you sourdough pancakes with fresh Seascape strawberries to boot. Together, we will light a votive candle on the breakfast table for Saint Francis.

Saint Frank 2,"A really superb operation. Impecable style + coffee (of any kind) will always draw a crowd, but the raison d'etre of Saint Frank I would argue is what they produce. They are a proud roaster with purpose and intention. With that said, they also hold a reverence for coffee as a medium.

The layouts of their shops are designed to encourage interaction, whether you're meeting a friend or someone new. The topics you cover or overhear might surprise you.

Blue Bottle,"So I am a big coffee fan. I grew up in Cambodia and traveled to Vietnam a lot and these are big coffee drinking country so coffee was my go-to drink ever since I was a kid. I'm always out looking for the best coffee in every city and here I am at another great one in the city, Blue Bottle Coffee.Blue Bottle has become big enough that they are in whole foods and have multiple locations in the city, but that doesn't mean they become overrated. This is the first time I've been to one of their locations since I usually just pick up a cold brew at Whole Foods so I was pretty excited. I'm also a sucker for aesthetically pleasing coffee shops so I can get instagram worthy shots as well so this place was a hit! I got the Cafe Mocha with Hayes Valley blend and asked for very little sugar and it was amazing! The latte art is nice and cute and they filled it up to the very top so I hate to walk like an old lady to get to our seats and grab an instagram worthy picture. I also LOVE marble and this location is filled with marbles as their counter/tabletops. So aesthetically pleasing, check, marble, check, great looking cup of coffee, check AND coffee that actually taste as good as they look, CHECK! I love everything except the fact that they don't have wifi or outlets. This is pretty shocking to me because there are decent amount of seating everywhere and working at coffee shop is kind of a thing for me, so it was a bummer. Now...I am writing this review, on my laptop here...but of course I have to tether myself to get internet and I have an external battery pack to charge my laptop so if you do still want to do some work here, I highly recommend packing some external battery and having tethering or some way to access the internet. Otherwise, it is more recommended for catching up with friends or some light browsing that you won't kill your battery for. This is probably the only reason why I would put this place as a 4/5 instead of 5/5.TLDR: Great coffee, Instagram worthy coffee shop, no outlets or wifi.",4.0,2019-03-02,0.47986111111111107,0.6190760869565218,0.14400000000000002,0.716,0.28577777777777774,0.9982,POSITIVE,0.9993552565574646,60.58,11.6,7.2,12.5,6.69,41,12th and 13th grade,60.58,11.6,12.5,6.69,2025

Blue Bottle,"Blue Bottle is (admittedly) overpriced and extremely slow, but they are extremely consistent in the quality of their coffee. Amongst the different high end coffee shops in the city, Blue Bottle still reigns as one of my favorites (both for mochas and lattes). This one usually has a line out the shop since it's in a high-density working area. There's two payment areas but I've usually only seen one person behind the register, so the line moves pretty slowly for the high volume of patrons who frequent this shop. It probably doesn't matter in the end, though, because the space behind the counter is extremely small and the rate that the drinks are produced is alarmingly slow. There's usually a couple baristas for espresso drinks, and one doing the drip coffees and tea. I will likely still come to this location, but make sure you allot yourself up to 15m (or more) minutes during peak times, like in the mornings before work.",4.0,2019-02-09,-0.12083333333333333,0.5159444444444445,0.152,0.883,0.14366666666666666,0.8477,POSITIVE,0.9998961687088013,64.95,9.9,9.64,12.6,7.41,27,11th and 12th grade,64.95,9.9,12.6,7.41,932

Blue Bottle,"Blue bottle was my first coffee love when I first moved back to the bay about 6 years ago. Blue bottle taught me to appreciate a GOOD cup of coffee. Upon my first visit to Blue Bottle, my close foodie friend introduced me to drip coffee and encouraged me not to add in the syrups and creams and really appreciate the true flavors of the drink. I was shocked, mind you that my previous coffee go-tos were always the sweet flavored drinks from Starbucks. Funny how your taste buds can change overtime... Trying out Blue Bottle elevated my spectrum of coffee, but then again, maybe just being in the Bay Area does that to you anyways. It's true, SF peeps are coffee snobs and like their good coffee! Blue Bottle has always been consistent with quality and taste. Their flavors are really strong so I always love getting a latte to add in the creaminess from the milk. I also adore their HOUSE MADE LIEGE WAFFLES. 5/5 stars for sure. They are hot off the press, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, with just a touch of sweet caramelized sugar goodness.

He returns my change with $10. I corrected him to say ""Oh, I gave you a $50 bill."" He returns the correct amount of change with no sincerity and a nice classic eyeroll. The interior has one large community table with limited amount of energy outlets. The music was obnoxiously loud- hard to have a normal conversation or study.

Contraband Coffee,"Addicted! I came here once before last year, ordered a latte and enjoyed it- wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Came back here last weekend on a cold and rainy day with the hubs- I insisted it is a great spot per reviews, and I shared my personal past experience was pleasant.The staff is a little intimidating, but we went forward and placed our orders. He ordered the Bhakti chai and I am almond milk latte. Much to my surprise, when we received our orders I somehow had an almond milk Bhakti chai- and it was the BEST mistaken order! The chai was creamy, slightly spicy and perfectly sweet! We loved it so much, we made a second stop that evening for a second round.The taste of that chai lingered with me all week, so I made my way down again, this time, per recommendation, ordering the pirate matcha chai. This was definitely more spice. The chai was overpowered by the matcha, but it worked well as I walked home through the cold. Would I order it again?

I was shocked - I was charged $7+ dollars, and it was literally just a splash, and had never been a problem before. The man (gruff, stocky one with white beard) person working, who I assumed to be the manager, made a comment about emailing the staff to make sure it was never done again - and they lost a loyal customer in doing so.

Crown & Crumpet Tea Stop,"Excellent service, tasty teas, convenience location is the good things about Crown & Crumpet Tea Stop Cafe. But this high tea restaurant is opened in the lobby of the building entrance. It doesn't feel as a good location for high tea! They also put in as many as tables they can. So we are feeling the pressures on the environment! The services are excellent. The waiters and waitresses was very attentive and very nice. The services are one of the best in my experience! They have so many choices of teas. I tried their House Private Blend and The Paris. Both are very good tasty teas. Specially the Paris recommenced by our waiter. The foods quality are below average!

Crown & Crumpet Tea Stop,"Came here with my family when my mom was in town.

We had a large party of 8 people and ordered multiple tea sets. I also ordered a gluten free one. I think we had three afternoon tea sets for one, one nursery tea set for my grandma, and other people ordered a la carte from the lunch menu. Their ordering process is kind of weird and everyone is required to order something but its okay to share things once they arrive. We had way more tea than we needed in the end BUT they let you take them away in to go cups at the end which is a nice perk.

(The other floors consists of different stores that have Japanese fashion and such, definitely check it out!)My boyfriend and I were the only ones there, so we were able to choose where we would like to sit. The decor is very cute and pink. It makes you feel like you are a little girl playing tea party with your stuffed animals when you are younger. We decided to do the Afternoon tea option for two. My boyfriend and I got two of their most popular teas and it came in a rather large pot with milk (must request). We also got a 3-tier tower that had finger sandwiches, scones, and other little pastries. The tea was delicious and the best part of the tier foods was the scones. Our server made sure everything was okay and addressed any questions that we possibly had. There were only one or two other parties in the area with us and he attended those tables with a lot of attention as well, even walking a woman who was on her own through their menu, seeing what she was interested in and would like.

The waiter was delightful, helping with tea selections and menu questions, taking good care of us for the afternoon.I ordered the afternoon tea for one and my husband ordered a sandwich salad combo. The amount was just enough. I would say that the afternoon tea for one is not a complete substitute for lunch, as it's not high tea and the portions are more complementary with several pots of tea (I had two). If you're looking for american portions this is not the place, this is conversational portions, enough to fill you but not overflow you. I enjoyed my meal and time very much, never feeling rushed.

Crown & Crumpet Tea Stop,I was somewhat disappointed when I entered Crown & Crumpet on Post Street.  The Tea Stop Cafe is located in the lobby area of a business building and I felt like I was sitting in the open area of a lobby not a tea room.  It was extremely difficult to find because of the location and they are only allowed to use a sidewalk sandwich board type of sign.  The table cloths are charming but when I looked under the table cloth I found that the white liners are very dirty and in need of a laundry.  Only one man was working and he did a superb job of attending to everyone by himself.  The scones and crumpets were delicious and warm.  The tea sandwiches tasty.  The desserts were so so...I'm not especially fond of sprinkles on so many sweets.  They offer a wide assortment of teas and the ones we tried were quite good.  I love the teacups and saucers which have wonderful quotes relating to tea printed on the cups.  I hope that this business will move to a better location.  Your shop at Ghirardelli Square was so charming compared to this shop.,3.0,2019-05-06,0.3111111111111111,0.7605263157894736,0.17025,0.702,0.31187499999999996,0.9922,NEGATIVE,0.9943979382514954,-100.06,75.4,8.84,96.2,15.29,25,-1th and 0th grade,0.0,20.0,14.0,9.9,1046

Definitely recommended if you are in the area.The only minus is that it was freaking cold in there. The building is an old warehouse of sorts, I guess not very well insulated and not well heated.

Sextant Coffee,"So today my girlfriend and I wanted to come to SOMA, because we've been alot of places in the city so far. I wanted to go to a coffee shop to start our day and I always love to go to places that roast thier own coffee, part of the third wave culture. As expected, I ordered an espresso, which I don't mind to be too sweet or fruity, thats always a big thing in a good espresso. It had a nice chocolatey flavor, with some berry and a little bitterness, not bad! What was bad however was hidden in the crema, I could taste a big mistake, it was definitely a light roasted or medium roasted coffee since it was so bright, but the crema tasted exactly like burned chaff, like the roaster did not blow off the chaff of the bean during the roasting process. Overall I give the coffee a 4/10. However, I was with my girlfriend as I mentioned and she ordered an almond milk cappucino, and it looked like they make their own almond milk or at the very least a good quality one. When the cappuccino came out the barista, who also took my order with a passively boring and slightly aggressive temper, put a cappucino that looked like a milk fart. It tasted absolutley awful, and it mayve been the ingredients fault. I won't blame the barista, she knew how to pull a double ristreto shot computently. The coffee is too acidic for the almond milk so the milk coagulated due to the lack of pasteurization and overall was so terrible that I wanted to throw up. The ""seamless bathroom"" experience was nothing of that sort, it was so complicated and stupid that it should be scrapped all together. Get you stuff together guys, you have all the best equipment with the poorest execution I could imagine. Take advantage of you situation and make good coffee, the world needs it.",1.0,2019-01-08,0.039731481481481465,0.5463131313131313,0.22599999999999998,0.762,0.19842857142857143,0.7117,NEGATIVE,0.9999983310699463,64.64,10.1,7.72,10.9,6.92,44,10th and 11th grade,64.64,10.1,10.9,6.92,1759

As you order, you can adjust the sweetness through 25% increments and you can adjust ice levels as well. My absolute favorites from here are the Roasted Oolong Milk Tea and the Tie Kuan Yin Milk Tea. The tea flavors are remarkably pronounced and that's solely what I really look for when I wanna have a good authentic milk tea. And also, the drink ratios of milk and tea are pretty balanced in my opinion. It kinda sucks for me cause I always order the same thing once I think it's good, so I definitely need to explore the rest of their menu as well! In my belief, I bet their other drinks are pretty good as well, and they have a pretty large variety of drinks to select off from the menu; which can range from salted cheese drinks, brown sugar milk tea, and fruity drinks. They also have desserts such as eggettes as well! I will definitely be back again for more visits for sure! Oh, and also, parking can be quite a hassle just because there's mainly meter parking. But you may be lucky if you can find something within the residential neighborhoods as well.",4.0,2019-06-02,0.2922123015873016,0.6046250684181718,0.0,0.768,0.24766666666666667,0.9951,POSITIVE,0.9999674558639526,78.89,6.7,6.67,7.6,6.68,34,6th and 7th grade,78.89,6.7,7.6,6.68,1312

I recommend this place especially if you like more natural n ""healthy"" teas! Btw their teas can run a little bitter though, so keep that in mind if you adjust the sugar levels.

Little,"Little Sweet was a stop on my way to dinner. I ordered two drinks - a regular milk tea for my man and a White Gourd Milk tea for me. When I went to order I told the guy taking my order I don't really like sweet drinks so I wanted to go for 25% sweetness for my White Gourd Milk Tea. He said the drink isn't that sweet and told me 50% would be not sweet already, and I hesitated and he said 50% is the best since they basically water it down to tone down the sweetness so it won't be sweet. So I agreed for 50% sweetness with his reassurance.For toppings, I asked about white boba - like was it the type that's crunchy, bouncy from other places like agar boba? He said the difference was that it is cooked vs uncooked and that he would not define any of the boba toppings as crunchy or bouncy. I was thinking...why would I want to eat uncooked boba aka tapioca starch balls!? Turns out it is NOT uncooked boba - so do not be alarmed since he wasn't good at describing...After I ordered and tried it in my drink I can confirm that it is actually the clear agar boba balls that is offered at other places. I tend to prefer it to actual boba since it is less sweet and has a smooth bouncy crunchy texture - hard to describe but that's what I would say. PS: If you don't like sweet drinks - DO NOT ORDER 50% White Gourd Milk Tea - it is waaaay tooo sweet despite his reassurances - tastes like 100% sweetness. White gourd lovers - we knowww that the drink is sweet already - so I can't imagine what actual 100% tastes like. If you decide to come here maybe opt for 25% sweetness if you have tastebuds like me!

U :Dessert,"Walking in, we had no issues with the service. We were seated right away and the restaurant was about a little more than half-filled. It is a bit cramped inside, but not uncomfortable. Since the restaurant is small and gets pretty busy, I would say catch the waiters when you can. There was always one by the front and one making the rounds up and down. We came to try out the crepe cakes and bingsoo. 1)  The Pandan Crepe Cake-  The taste was a little disappointing. If you're a texture person, a bite through the layers of crepes and creme was pretty satisfying. But overall, you were hit with the same taste you'd typically get with any pandan pastry. Not mind-blowing, but not bad either.2) Volcano Bingsoo- Definitely for the gram. The dessert comes to you steaming and eventually fizzles out, so record it once you see it on the way to your table. As for the taste, I probably should've asked for more condensed milk, but the shaved ice is definitely top tier. It was all my favorite flavors textures, chocolate/corn flakes/condensed milk, etc. so my opinion on this dessert is bias if you're looking for something more on the ""what makes it different"" side.

We ended up getting:[1] Coconut Pandan Crepe Cake ($12.75) - This was okay, I think I would have rather had the waffle version. The flavor is light and not as strong as I expected. Not enough pandan and plenty of coconut. [2] Igloos Kakigori ($14) - I was more excited about the marshmallow fluff on fire than actually eating it. The fire was a bit anti-climatic for me. Thought it would last longer. Inside the mountain was the flavorless ice which is why the wooden cups of a kiwi syrup and condense milk was needed. Eat the top and start pour down the center to get flavor. We didn't know it but at the bottom of the bowl there was popping boba that was pretty good. Definitely a fun gimmick that I probably won't be getting again. Overall the experience was fun but in terms of dessert quality I thought it was just in the okay range.

The bread was perfectly toasted and lightly garlic flavored which (SOMEHOW) went amazingly well with the sweet nutty mochi flavor - pretty much perfect blend of sweet and savory.(4) Young Coconut Pandan Crepe Cake - not the best crepe cake, but still really freakin good. Flavors were amazing and perfectly light in pandan flavor + also loved the coconut toppings and side of coconut cream. The texture of the crepe itself was a little too soft compared to others I've had, but flavors made up for it.(5) Matcha Latte - tasty!

If you want a carby, warmer alternative to the binsu, you could get this. The inside bread squares are very tasty and buttery, but the outside of the brick toast is harder and cracker-like - typical of brick toast.Soft Bread with Pandan Fondue:If you don't like eating the outside crust of brick toast, but want the soft inside this is perfect for you. It's squares of the bread, prepared similarly to brick toast, dipped in a sweet Pandan or Thai Tea (pick one) fondue. We got the pandan and it was very tasty, but also super heavy/filling and definitely something you need to share among multiple people. Mango Sticky Rice Bingsu:My favorite out of everything I've tried so far. The mango sauce + condensed milk drizzled on top are the perfect topping to the super soft shaved ice.

0,"Quick Summary:- Recommend the Cafe Au Lait because one gets to personalize their coffee (you will see what I mean once you visit)- Unique coffee ordering experience- Cute decoration (the train caught my eye)- The aroma of roasted coffee beans is spectacular- We came at a right time, but a line grew while we were drinking coffee- More of a grab and go coffee place because of limited seating spaceWe were lured into the cafe by the cute coffee bean roasting train near the cafe entrance. Since we were looking for a place to sit down and drink some coffee, we decided to try here. I was first surprised and confused at the four different coffee dispensers at the area, where there are sugar and creams, and I later realized why. I ordered the cafe au lait and when the received my order, it was a cup filled with foamy milk. I probably looked dumbfounded because the cashier gestured and told me to pour coffee from the coffee dispensers. There were four different types (one being decaf), and I selected the darkest roast. The coffee was SO GOOD! My favorite type of coffee is the taste where it has no sour and bitter notes. The french roast didn't include any of these, and after I took a sip, it left a lingering toasty aftertaste. Even my relative, who can't drink coffee because they don't like the bitter taste, was able to drink a share. I was even tempted to purchase a bag of coffee beans, but that will be for the next visit.",5.0,2018-04-15,0.1992579365079365,0.511189058956916,0.171,0.819,0.2435,-0.0985,POSITIVE,0.9910613894462585,72.6,9.1,8.07,11.6,6.92,35,11th and 12th grade,72.6,9.1,11.6,6.92,1437

Stanza,"When I think of Stanza, I tend to consider it my secondary option for coffee if I'm in that part of the Mission. There are a lot of excellent cafes and coffee vendors in the area, and comparing Stanza to the wealth of other options makes me think it's just all right. For example, if you are looking for a workspace, the limited seating options and dim lighting makes this place not so inviting to write or read for a long time (I guess an exception would be if you are a cave dweller or a vampire who has foolishly ventured out in the daytime and need a safe space to hide out from the sun). However, the coffee is great, and I usually get my drink to go given the space limitations.

Cafe,"We've always loved the Randall Museum and missed it while it was being renovated, but one of the best things about the renovation is the addition of Café Josephine: a much needed and long awaited onsite café and food stop for families.  Holding it's grand opening this past June 2018, Café Josephine just upped the Randall Museum's game.  This ain't your lame and basic park and rec food concession with limpy hotdogs under heat lamps, and packaged, processed, sugared up baked goods.  Owners Sahara and Jason are thoughtful about their food offerings, and Café Josephine offers up fresh, locally sourced and organic produce and food made to order.  Food is super fresh and delicious:  salads are tasty (the kale salad and egg salad is our fav), fresh baked cookies, homemade and healthy ""lunchables"" that kids love, made to order grilled cheese options and creative toasts (tartines), organic hot soups, and sandwiches too.  (...And we love that they add fresh sliced strawberries to your lemonade - it's the little touches that make the biggest difference!)  They make killer Andytown Coffee espresso drinks (and even have your Snowy Plover if you're craving it) and have a great selection of premium teas as well.The café is the perfect place to stop and take a deep breath with a coffee in hand (steamed milk with cinnamon for the kiddies) and take in the sweeping 360 views before you set out to conquer the City or about take on the Randall's animal room.  You're literally in the heart of the city, and yet you feel like you're miles away from it all.  Now go and visit!  You won't be disappointed.",5.0,2018-07-23,0.13776041666666666,0.5479166666666666,0.111,0.714,0.207375,0.9974,POSITIVE,0.9998911619186401,-189.72,107.8,11.29,138.5,20.17,51,107th and 108th grade,0.0,20.0,14.0,9.9,1605

Philz,"Not having espresso products is dumb. Not having any empty tables for people to sit at, also dumb. I went here for a meeting when I was visiting S.F., not knowing that this was a weird hipster coffee shop that doesn't do typical normal coffee drinks like lattes etc. And on top of it, there was literally nowhere to sit because S.F. City College students have run the place over. They probably have such tiny apartments that they literally have to live at Philz Coffee to get their homework done. The closet they rent for $3K a month doesn't have room for a desk underneath their murphy bed/kitchenette/living room couch hybrid. There should be a time limit on how long you can spend in a coffee shop on your laptop watching cat videos. If you're done with your drink and aren't buying another one, you should have to go back to your closet. They get two stars because the iced coffee I got wasn't horrible and the employees were super nice. The product offering and lack of available seating just killed it for me though. Should be expected in S.F. though, where it's tough to find your own section of sidewalk to stand on.UPDATE: The owner wrote me and said they're working on the seating issues and that their employee should've told me about their drink options that are similar to typical latte, non-pour over stuff. I appreciate him writing me, because it shows they care. I'll admit a lot of my issues are out of the control of the business owner, but I do think not including normal beverages or flavors alienates a large portion of coffee drinking clientele.

Philz,"I've had multiple bad experiences at this Philz and others. I don't know if it's stigmas against me, or that Philz has really gone downhill over the years, or Philz employees are just snooty, entitled hipsters. Probably all the above. This is probably one of the newest Philz, in one of the most rapidly-gentrifying parts of the city. When I last went to this Philz, it seemed like 100% of their customers and employees were snooty, tattoed, extremely stylish Millenials in their 20s and younger. City College area just gets more bougie and gentrified by the day. Just a few short years ago, that area was still ghetto, cold, sparse, and uncool - what a mere community college area should be like. But with the opening of Whole Foods, and the resultant barrage of hip businesses and expensive housing - the City College area has gotten to be as snotty hipster as the rest of the city. Well. A while ago, I politely asked the cashier for a restroom code, and before I was able to finish my sentence, she angrily muttered the code - as if to slam it in my face. I get that ""cattle"" tone and subhuman treatment constantly - but it's even worse at hipster elitist places like Philz. Um, I'm more Philz than any of you - I've been to Philz ever since they opened in the mid-2000s, and to every location in SF, and I've tried all 12 of their coffees multiple times each. I'm so much more fully Philz than any of you - and you dare think I don't belong, stick out like a sore thumb, and deserve the most demeaning, contemptuous treatment?Another time I went, I was digging in my tote bag for my wallet, and the hipster cashier rudely kept tapping at the counter - even as I profusely kept apologizing for keeping her waiting - for like 30 seconds. The disgust and disdain for certain unattractive Asians like me is everywhere, and extreme, uncalled for, and absolutely unacceptable. At every table and sofa at Philz - all the snooty trendy Millenials avoided eye contact with me completely, and if they happened to see me, they gave a disgusted look and quickly looked away, like they saw the most lowly thing on earth. Remember, I started going to Philz, all their stores, enthusiastically, long before they ever had coffee in their lives. Who's more Philz - me or them?The coffee I got the last time I went was pretty bad, too - so undrinkable, I thought of throwing it out after a few sips. The only saving grace for Philz is that they do purport to hear about your complaints - though I don't know if they actually take action after hearing my complaints. I don't know if they actually try to train staff to always treat ALL customers with the same amount of warmth, fairness, and respect. It's an unwelcoming, rude place for Asians who look older and fobby - and I'm neither old nor fobby (I'm US-born) - but that's how I'm adamantly seen, treated, brutalized, and excluded.",2.0,2019-03-30,0.08249999999999999,0.4740575396825398,0.21111111111111114,0.778,0.28271428571428575,-0.9833,NEGATIVE,0.9999858140945435,61.4,11.3,8.83,13.8,7.45,80,7th and 8th grade,61.4,11.3,13.8,7.45,2872

This location definitely meets all those requirements. It's a fairly large space with lots of table and couch seating.

Philz,"I visit this location since I go to city college, but I have found other locations to be much better. Whenever I come here it's a pretty disappointing experience. Their coffee is still somewhat good. But, they're definitely a miss on customer service. I understand when they are busy but they seem to take their time and enjoy conversations with coworkers. They stand there and talk to the other baristas, then call you over when they are done with their personal conversations. Most of the time I don't even get greeted or asked what do I want. They will just stare at you awkwardly and expect you to order. When ordering food, they will put your food on the counter and not call your name, so you don't even know it's ready. I find this location to lack cleanliness and interest in their customers. I have only had experiences like this at this particular location. I really dislike paying money (Philz is on the expensive side compared to other companies) at a place where they aren't interested in giving customers respect and decent customer service.

Philz,"Love This Philz Coffee In SF's Potrero Hill Hood...SITREP.,.in marked contrast to the Philz here in Sacramento that is much more...uh... *meh.When I'm visiting in Potrero Hill, this is my 1ST choice to come to for coffee, and I have to give thanks to the Yelp app, since I found this spot with it.  THE SETUPSituated just to the right of the I-680 Freeway, this was only a 10-minute walk from buddy's home where I was staying.  It kinda is in an industrial area, of sorts, but this neighborhood has a lot of work/living loft arrangements and a lot of businesses in old warehouses.The advantage of this is that this Philz is quite spacious!  Lots of room inside.  And lots of room on the outside front patio.I would have preferred to have been outside, but I specifically posted here for a few hours to give my iPhone X a chance to update with the new iOS 12.1 operating system without interruption and I wanted my laptop to be juiced up for the entire time, so I chose a table with outlets.COFFEE & QUICHE!While here let my laptop and phone update themselves, I casually wrote some Yelp reviews, and enjoy some of the taste treats here:* I had their coffee ""Ambrosia of God"" - a delightful flavor.  What I am put off by, though, is their strict barista regulation of all ""input"" into the coffee.  By that, I mean, THEY also put in the sweeteners, and THEY also put in the Creamer, and THEY also put in any of the powdered flavors you want in your coffee.  yelp.com/biz_photos/phil…   I like doing that myself, no offense.  * I also had their artistic looking vegetable quiche - it was stylish & tasty, if a bit more pricey when compared to other coffee shop quiches I patronize.yelp.com/biz_photos/phil…WIFIDefinitively yes.  But after all, ""WiFi"" IS a filter I include in my search so I would have been sorely disappointed if they hadn't.DECOR!Both beautiful art and contemporary decor make this a pleasant place to gaze upon while contemplating what to write.Their lighting is also cleverly created to show ""Love"".yelp.com/biz_photos/phil…THE LOWDOWNThank you, Philz, for providing a nice spot to both relax and get some work done, while enjoying some coffee & taste bites in the meantime!",4.0,2018-11-07,0.1599107142857143,0.5878961811997526,0.27,0.811,0.35800000000000004,0.993,POSITIVE,0.9998993873596191,-289.19,146.0,11.05,187.5,24.68,61,145th and 146th grade,0.0,20.0,14.0,9.9,2191

There's some outdoor seating, as well as tons of space inside!! The inside is SUPER HIP!! So nicely decorated, and it has a nice modern vibe!!My go-to drink orders:- 1/2 yerba mate, 1/2 chamomile, iced, medium creamy with almond milk and light sweet with honey- Iced Philtered Soul, straight upIt is the headquarters, so they test out new food items here. They had the ricotta & pistachio toast, which isn't something you can find at all the locations that serve food (not all locations have toast/food selections other than what you see in the bakery display case)!! The ricotta & pistachio toast was kinda missing something?? It was served on Starter Bakery bread and came with honey and sea salt, but it kinda lacked the flavor I was expecting?? It was tasty with a hint of sweet and salty that complemented each other nicely, but I think I'm going to stick to my usual: avocado toast with no eggThey had a creamy hazelnut toast on the menu, but I didn't see it in the display case, so I asked if they were still serving it, and the worker said they ran out of hazelnuts and that they stopped because it wasn't super popular :( I also saw a few energy bowl options!!

Food: 5They have a tasty variety of options that range from small bites like a toast or for larger appetites they have sandwiches and salads. I had the avocado toast which was good, fresh, and I liked the chili oil that was drizzled on top too. I had been here once before, and I'm pretty sure I got a salad and was happy with that also.Ambiance: 4This cafe was so cute and bright. Plenty of seating and plugs along the walls. There wasn't anything super special about it, but I was comfortable, and the natural light is critical. They did have a little bit of a fly issue... but they flew pretty high that they weren't a real bother. Staff was friendly didn't go much out of their way, but helpful when asked.

Cafe St.,"One of my favorite spots in the city! A very cute Portuguese style cafe with good coffee and even better food. My favorite things to get are the breakfast board, banana bread, the chia bowl, and my guilty pleasure - a mimosa! The breakfast board comes on a chopping board with a few slices of ham, a warmed baguette, softened butter, and Portuguese cheese (I don't know my cheeses, but I'd say it tastes like a creamier Parmesan). For $7 it's quite filling, though the only downside is you have the slice the baguette yourself, which is a real arm workout since we were only provided with a butter knife. The banana bread warmed up is amazing, especially with the warmed butter it comes with. They're also quite generous with the mimosa, filled to the brim for $7! Check this place out if you're looking for a chill cafe in the Mission. It's a good place to spend a few hours studying at as well since there are outlets on both sides of the wall!

Cafe St.,Quick take: Love this spot for a lazy Sunday brunchThis place has really great breakfast and brunch items. St. Jorge is a CA/Portuguese inspired cafe. Very fresh and organic foods. This place is a small spot. We have been lucky and got a table both times we came in. The line moves fast but you do have time to decide what to order while waiting in line.Baked egg breakfast slider: Add ham/avocadoOrange blossom waffle:Add fruitOrange SumoSpicy Chai LatteWe ordered a panini sandwich....it had pesto in it.

Blue Bottle,"Wow.  I want to say my heartfelt thanks to the barista that turned my day around today.  Here's how my day started: I got a $76 parking ticket just 3 min after my meter ran out.  I even talked with the issuing officer and she was rigid as expected and wouldn't take back the ticket.  I was so furious I may have popped a vein or something!Then I had to make it to a visa appointment and literally sprinted to make it.  They asked for some silly documentation (like photocopy of the passport that they were holding in their hands!) that required me to go back in a couple of hours.  I decided to go to the UPS store next to Blue Bottle to print some docs.So as you can see I was in a very foul mood.Before I go to UPS, I decide to sit in Blue Bottle and organize some of the silly docs the embassy asked for. I walk into Blue Bottle and the barista asks me how I was.  I hesitated but needed a place to vent so I told him I was a little annoyed that I got a parking ticket.  He said he would take care of my drink and WAIVED THE COST OF MY DRINK!!  WOW.  I was so touched.  I immediately asked to break my $20 bill into 5s and tipped him a $5.Seriously, blue bottle, you guys are my new fave!!

The interior decor was contemporary and felt comfortable. The New Orleans iced coffee was quite good. 3-stars are for the amenities and atmosphere inside. Ever since Blue Bottle Coffee was acquired by Nestle for $700M, I've wanted to swing by to see what this new concept was about. This was my first Blue Bottle experience because I happened to be in the neighborhood. I did not come with high expectations. My thinking was that unless you're a coffee connoisseur, you would likely miss the hype train that everyone else had been on. I was gladly proven wrong regarding this point. The iced-coffee here was noticeably better than any other iced I've had in a while. The perfect amount of sweetness with a smooth finish. I was very happy with this order. The location itself leaves a bit to be wanting. There was no WiFi (!) in the shop. I understand faster table turnover is an important business metric, but this may be trying a little too hard. The baristas sometimes don't seem to have that much attention to detail either. I was sitting next to a table of empty mugs with some liquid spilled on it.

I understand charging extra for non-dairy milks - for lattes, aux laits, etc. You're getting 8-16 oz. of it. But to charge the same amount for a small splash makes no sense.

Beanstalk,"IF YOU ARE THAT TYPE OF PERSON WHO LIKES TO SPEND TIME AT CAFE, TRY HERE. I used to live two blocks away from there right above StarBucks. The reason why I had to climb two blocks on the hill, even though I live right above the big coffee chain store, was that this coffee shop has the nice, chill, and relaxed atmosphere that you would wanna open your laptop and do some choirs for an hour or so. The design of inside is very nice; white painted dining area and big windows keep the space very bright and open. I wish they play better music not just pop from radio or something to match to the atmosphere of the floor. I see new staff every time I go there, but they all are friendly even when they seem to be very busy. I tried many of their drinks but nothing wasn't really outstanding to me for the price. So I would say if you are big fun of coffee and you go cafe not to spend time at nice space but to get really nice coffee this place may not be the best one for you. But considering the fact that it's right in the middle of downtown and have great vibe, this is worth it. Cold brew was good, but I personally don't recommend matcha latte, if you are used to sweet ones with intense matcha flavor. I tried few times but they make it very milky and you don't really taste matcha. I felt like I was drinking just a cup of green colored milk. I also tried some of their sandwiches. Korean bbq sandwich is one of the item that sounds delicious and different on the menu, but when I tried the meat wasn't really seasoned and it was kind of watery.

Samovar Tea - Yerba Buena,"Samovar Tea is located on the upper terrace of Yerba Buena Gardens and the shop looks to have been designed for you to fully enjoy looking out into gardens with its huge glass walls and covered patio seating. You never have to worry about inclement weather on the patio since it's a frosted glass covered walkway that is a permanent fixture, not a retractable awning or umbrellas. It was a cooler rainy day and we couldn't help but sit on the patio. It was truly one of the most peaceful and serene experiences I've had downtown San Francisco. We enjoyed a pot of blood orange pu erh and a platter of scones while we watched the rain fall over the blooming flowers. The pot of teas are recommended for 1 or 2. You can continue to request more hot water. The server who brought out the tea gave us instructions on how long to steep for and gave us a little background on it as well. For this specific tea, he let us know that the blood orange is pretty traditional in China although the addition of the ginger was not. On the menu it also mentioned that one of the ingredients (?) included wood chips but he didn't mention that one. I'm not sure if there were wood chips included. There were shavings but I'm pretty sure that was the ginger and possibly citrus peel. I mostly tasted the ginger for this tea which was cut with the sweetness of the blood orange. The scone platter was a great accompaniment to the tea. There were three big scones topped with oats and with dried cherries baked into them. The platter came with 4 different toppings including a smooth butter, strawberry jam, blueberry jam, and cherry jam. The jams all brought a lot of sweetness and there were chunks of fruit to be found in each.Samovar is more than just a traditional tea shop as there were a lot of matcha variations which are very in right now, as well as some milk teas.

What's even more hilarious is that they have one of those receipts with the ""check a box between 15%, 20%, 25% auto calculated tip"". And guess what? The % is calculated on the total + sf mandate tax + sales tax + back of house fee (kitchen tip). So they're essentially asking you to tip on top of tip.

Samovar Tea - Yerba Buena,"I love the location of Samovar and the food and drinks are pretty good, but I'm growing frustrated by the deceptive pricing and hidden fees.First, I have found on three different occasions that the price on my receipt was higher than the price on the menu.  For instance, the Cold Brew Matcha is $7 on the menu, but is $8 on the bill.  They are always shocked when I highlight these discrepancies and only fix it with a one-time discount on the bill - they don't seem to fix the POS.Second, they charge an ""SF Employer Mandate,"" as so many restaurants do.  As you hopefully know now, this is not a real tax and restaurants charge an arbitrary amount to cover costs to comply with the new law requiring businesses with over 20 employees to provide healthcare for employees. Samovar charges 5% of the bill, which is far more than would be required to comply with the $1.89 per employee hour for healthcare.Third, they now also charge an additional mysterious ""Back of House Service Fee"" which is 4% of the total bill. It's unclear what this money goes towards, but presumably compensation for the cooks and cleaning staff.  But shouldn't that come out of the revenues? Or the tip?Don't get me wrong - I'm strongly supportive of increasing the wages for restaurant workers.

Samovar Tea - Yerba Buena,"Samovar once was a great tea shop near Dolores park. Like so much of post tech sf, it's gone way down in quality and way up in prices. Today - the final straw - I come to a nearly empty place and am told I can't sit for tea until my friend arrives! Sabrina was very nice, and said it was what she was trained to do. I was quite bothered but take her at her word that Jesse (the owner though she didn't mention his name) must have wanted that. Some of the tea is still very good like the blood orange puer and  the incomparable green ecstasy (sencha snd matcha). But even that has gone downhill from the original preparation and now quite bitter. If you buy the tea leaves, the instructions are often way wrong - like the green ecstasy should be cold brewed then ten seconds in 185 water - not two minutes boiling! The tempeh is great fir vegetarian but sickly sweet. Other nice dishes are the Japanese tea service. Once the tech bubble bursts, I imagine the shop will regroup and go back to its previous quality. In the meantime, buy Japanese tea as asakichi in Japan town. The matcha is much cheaper and much better. I buy the very best orange dot but it's the priciest. Jesse, please bring back the old samovar standards",2.0,2019-05-05,0.38345238095238093,0.46553639846743294,0.178,0.734,0.2407777777777778,0.9948,NEGATIVE,0.999990701675415,81.53,5.6,6.66,6.7,6.54,31,6th and 7th grade,81.53,5.6,6.7,6.54,1222

After asking the worker if i pick up my tea here all she said was what tea is it and makes it within 2 minutes. No apology either.

0,"Empanadas and Churros... I feel like the world would be a better place if we had more places like this. Let's start with the CHURROS. $4 for a basket and dipping sauce? Sign me up. I prefer the sauce to be in the side cause sometimes you wanna just enjoy the churro by itself. This is the best Churro I've had in the Bay Area so far, (I haven't done much Churro hunting out here) but so far this is the best. I think there's a tad bit too much dough but size can be a little thinner. The sauce is a great complement. It isn't too sweet so it's not just sweet on sweet.As for the Empanadas... I ordered 3 different onesCarne - The best out of the bunch, the flavor in the ground beef is the highlight. (baked)Jack Cheese - This was okay, nothing special unless this is your favorite type of cheese (fried)Spinach with White Cream - This would have been a Home run if the ratio of the white cream to the spinach was at least 50/50. Its more like 80/20, they packed a lot so much spinach in there that Popeye would be proud. Didn't try any coffee but I bet it would go great with the Churros.

The crust was flaky and not too oily, and the fillings are flavorful and unique. I knocked down a star because the drink options are still lacking.

Just the right crunch, but the inside was too doughy for my taste. Is the middle of a churro supposed to be like this?

0,"After reminiscing about churros in mexico city, I recalled a new place my friend told me about in the Outer Sunset. I stopped in to get some as a snack before heading to dinner. I got 1 order (3 churros -$3.95) + a dipping sauce of dulce de leche (+$1). Note - they do make you wait since they are made to order so don't expect to just run in and out. Even though you have to wait, I love that they are fresh. Maybe my expectations were high because they were being made to order, but they were very doughy and not crispy at all. Also, they were very lightly sugared. I would have preferred more sugar. I had to use the dipping sauce to enhance the favor and without the sauce, the churros would have been too plain to eat alone in my opinion. I also got a shot of espresso with some condensed milk on the bottom. It was good, but not worth the price.The place is a cute spot for a quick bite with friends and I love the minimalist, hipster-ish decor.

My husband and I buy coffee here about once a week. They'vev always been a bit strange about using a reusable coffee cup you have - I think because they feel you are trying to get free extra coffee (which for me is not the case!) Today, I dropped my cappuccino as soon as they gave it to me. I had not even had a sip or left the shop. As they started to remake my drink, they rang up my order on the cash register to charge me again. I was surprised! When I asked if I was actually being charged, they said they could as a 1-off charge me for a smaller size. I decided I'd rather just go to another coffee shop at that point.

I waited for 20 min on one smoothie because the aforementioned woman proceeded to do everything from refilling sauce bottles and making orders for customers who came after me before thinking about the single smoothie I ordered. When she handed over the smoothie she just gave me the stink eye and to top it all off, it wasn't even the right smoothie. I didn't even have time to say anything since the 20 min wait made me late for my class that night.

We finally had to say something to get their attention and order. We sat outside because the inside was too crowded and it was a beautiful day. Once we were done I brought our bowls back inside and the employee looked at me without saying a word. In fact, I was the one who said thank you - not sure why, but probably out of habit and having manners. The couple sitting across from us outside was waiting for 20 minutes for their juices and after being scolded from employees for filling their water bottle at the cafe's communal dispenser and for asking about the status of their juices, they decided to leave without waiting for their order to be completed.

An extra shot of espresso and the removal of half the sugar would have probably been more to my liking. It was good, just too much like dessert for me.The almond croissant was also good, but reheating it by microwaving it doesn't leave me with a very good impression.

Tierra Mia,Out on our adventure hubs and I needed to recharge. This coffee shop is the absolute reason I love coming to big cities. It's away from touristy places and just super chill. When you get here please try their horchata cream! Its like the horchata shake I get from Portos (best bakery in the country) the hot chocolate is really made well with steamed milk. Foam is super think and enjoyable. Scene us really northern california vibe. Its cozy and has a bunch of outlets everywhere. The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable.

Tierra Mia,"I've walked by this spot every time I walk on this part of Mission Street, but my inner clock was not dialed to coffee time until recently when I actually entered the cafe on a whim. I've actually been to the other Tierra Mia on Broadway in Oakland to meet a former colleague, but I threw balls to the wall and ordered one of their specialties, the sweeter than sweet Horchata Frappe (review: bit.ly/2xrOCDY). I noticed they serve that sugary confection here, but I tried to hold the reins tighter by ordering an 8-oz Cappuccino Italiano since it was a coolish afternoon even though I know it's a major faux pas to have cappuccino after 12 Noon (photo: bit.ly/2OEQT5O). I didn't get grief for my order, but I certainly got plenty of sugar as it was a most dessert-like drink for the middle of the afternoon.

Klatch,"Stopped by Klatch to get a bite during my morning walk in the neighborhood. Found a very pleasant, mod interior. The decor is  spare with open space, floor to ceiling windows along the two sides facing the street. A lot of natural light making the cafe feel more spacious. Blond wood, concrete and glass.There was a tempting display of Craftsman & Wolves pastries. Lovely to look at & nice to know I don't have to haul myself to the Mission to get these goodies.I'm not a coffee drinker so I can't speak about their coffee-related beverages. Just went to pick up a pastry and ended up choosing a chocolate croissant. Since this is delivered from C&W of course the pastry is room temp. When I have the pastry in hand, I notice it feels very light & airy. The croissant is tinted light brown so it looks like there is chocolate in the pastry dough. My first bite I find the taste very faint. The sugar on the outside gives the croissant it's hit of sweetness. Biting further in I find the finger of Valrhona chocolate that I was looking for. It's a t-i-n-y finger of chocolate so I'm mixed about this. Is this to assuage feelings of guilt about eating this indulgent pastry or in keeping with the light image? Je ne sais pas.There are a few cool coffee magazines for aficionados lying about. The workers are busy keeping the flow behind the counter going. Since this cafe offers fresh savory food as well, I notice there's prep going on to make avocado toasts. Maybe next time.Back to the chocolate croissant. I'd say it was disappointing. Nice & light but I was looking for more flavor. I don't taste the buttery richness that I look for in a croissant. It would also be nice if there was a little more Valrhona chocolate. That's just my inner glutton speaking. At $4.85, it's not an inexpensive pastry. So I'll look elsewhere for these treats.Overall, I like the ambiance and service at Klatch.

They've recently opened here in SF (Franklin St). Soon to have another location in the Mission. This is going to sound funny (and I happen to be severely lactose intolerant). My very first time at Klatch, I ordered a mocha shake. Back then, pat milk was just starting to hype up, and I saw they had oat milk on their choices of milk. Me getting too excited, I told the lady I wanted a mocha shake with Oat Milk. She looked at me kinda funny and started to explain that their shakes are made with ice cream that contains dairy....I thought for a second, and said, what the heck! Let's make it anyway! She smiled and said ok!! That was the start of the love life between oat milk and mocha shake at Klatch!!! Lactose intolerant or not, best mocha shake ever!!! At this location, they serve pastries from Craftsman and Wolves, another one of my favorite places!! Come to Klatch Coffee for some really good coffee. Oh hubby loves their cold brew as well!

It was a PACKED HOUSE, say whaaaaaa. Dang, people are committed to the cause of gettin in IG photos with the good morning light. Anyway, onto the menu. I've tried a few of their drinks. Their matcha is delicious. For a more unique drink, try their hojichata. I also like their black sesame tea cake because it's not too dense or sweet. They have a good selection of pastries and savory foods. Service: 5 stars! That's the really reason I updated this yelp review to +1 ( or + star). We wanted to hojichata, but we couldn't remember the name of it and  didn't see it on the wall menu. So we ended up ordering the hojicha latte. We got it and were disappointed. Too much milk, meh. Give me that hojicha, rice, cinnamon, vanilla & agave (hint: those are the ingredients in the hojichata). My friend asked the staff about it, and they said the hojichata was on the paper menu. Que lastima, we misordered! Fret not though, the staff happily replaced our drinks with no extra charge. They were busy at the time, yet they were extremely friendly about it.

It's the highlight of their menu and I'm normally a pastry/sweets person. I've also had their matcha latte, matcha affogato, and black sesame cream puff. Everything is good but I still stand by the pickles, chicken okayu, and the out of this world hojicha latte which is the perfect balance of sweet and rice/barley oat tea.

Stonemill,"Have you ever wondered how much caffeine is in a matcha?  If so, do like we did. Wander in to Stonewall Matcha at 4 pm on a Sunday, enjoy some tea and some tea-infused desserts, and then when everyone you went in with is up at 2 am and not at all tired, it begins to sink in that matcha has a lot of caffeine in it.  A LOT.Lack of preparation aside, if you pace yourself (and we did not since our drinks and dessert all were chock full of matcha) Stonemill Matcha is good alternative option for a tea spot in the city.  Our group liked the almond milk matcha.  The warm ginger matcha latte was even better, with a nice shot of fresh ginger syrup.  The interior is minimalistic, from the Scandi- light woods, to the sparce artistic signage and limited, well-selected baked goods in the case, to the steampunk tea making areas, to the simple black pottery. Desserts here are a mixed bag, our favorites being the matcha parfait (sundae) and the strawberry roll cake. Their matcha cream puff looks beautiful, but the cream puff shell was extremely hard and off putting. The matcha pie looked appealing, a fluffy matcha meringue , but the person in front of us got the last slice of the day.

Five Star Truffles,"I ordered here from online here earlier today. The process was extremely smooth. I ordered 16 hazelnut, 8 black and white, 8 caramel, and 8 dark chocolate. It was 36 dollars for the 40 truffles, which comes out to 90 cents each truffle. What a steal!  There was a confirmation email sent to my email, and the order was fulfilled through GrubHub for delivery. It was an estimated 30-40 minutes for delivery, which was extremely accurate. That's faster than if I were to go out to their store, find parking, go inside and order, then go home! I indicated on the delivery notes, that I wouldn't be home and to just drop off the delivery on the porch. A text message was sent to me indicating that the delivery was dropped off. That gave me a sense of reassurance. When I got home, I opened up the packaging, to see the different flavors were put in separate bags and labeled. I put them onto a little tray for the guests when they arrived. The dark chocolate and hazelnut pieces were distinguishable because the nuts used for dark chocolate had a more toasted look. However, I couldn't tell the difference between the black and white pieces with the caramel pieces. Both of those flavors were coated with cocoa powder on the outside. Not a big deal since my guests have no allergies to anything. The only downside are that you can tell these truffles are definitely handmade. Normally, that would be a good thing! But these were a little on the not pretty side as they were rolled in non-uniform circles. It seemed like they didn't put that much effort in making them look pretty. They still tasted delicious.

Pretty sure they're dog-friendly because there's a water bowl right outside. Anyways, great spot to host groups or just catch up with a friend, which is what I did.Even if you don't hang out inside Blue Bottle, there's plenty of seating around South Park. Definitely sit outside if the weather is nice or go for a stroll around SOMA. Love the Blue Bottle brand and visiting all their locations. This is probably one of my favorites because it has lots of seating and isn't usually very crowded.",4.0,2019-02-28,0.22725468975468976,0.409901738473167,0.0,0.798,0.263625,0.9904,POSITIVE,0.9998181462287903,78.08,7.0,8.12,9.2,6.09,18,6th and 7th grade,78.08,7.0,9.2,6.09,1023
Blue Bottle,"Came in on a summer day for an iced coffee. Does anyone drink their coffee hot anymore? Anyways...I heard great things about Blue Bottle, so my expectations were fairly high for this new and trending coffee shop. The lady who helped me was very welcoming and explained the different blends they sold. It's always great knowing that your barista knows their stuff!I ordered the least expensive blend and got it with almond milk. The only issue with Blue Bottle that I have is that I feel like the price doesn't match the quantity nor the quality of what you get. After a few sips, I figured that it was smooth and mellow, but nothing seemed special about it.Perhaps I don't drink enough coffee to have developed a palate for it, but I surely didn't quite get the hype around Blue Bottle.",3.0,2019-02-20,0.21495129870129873,0.5002559428875218,0.161,0.888,0.17825000000000002,0.8482,POSITIVE,0.9958279728889465,76.45,7.6,8.47,10.2,6.65,18,7th and 8th grade,76.45,7.6,10.2,6.65,786

Blue Bottle,"I don't have a problem owning up to it - on several occasions in the past, I've outright said I didn't think Blue Bottle was worth the hype.  Maybe it's because my taste in coffee isn't discerning enough (Pike Place is my go-to), but I just never understood why Blue Bottle was so revered.  That is, until now.  After all of these years, I finally figured out what the problem has been - I just haven't been ordering the right thing!  I KNEW it couldn't have been me...ha!Out of all of the different ones I've been to (here, Mint Plaza, and the Ferry Building), this particular Blue Bottle is by far my favorite.  Besides how it's (relatively) close to my office, it's also got a great feel to it.  The minimalist look, the spacious feel (compared to its sister spots), the fact I've always been able to snag a seat the times I've stuck around to enjoy my drink...not much to complain about!  Most importantly, they keep the line/crowds moving surprisingly fast!While I'd always stuck with their hot drinks in the past, I finally decided to try something different and ordered the NEW ORLEANS ICED COFFEE with Cane Sugar, Milk, and Roasted Chicory ($4.25).  Now, I don't want to oversell this, but talk about a game changer!  Not only did it have just the right amount of milk and sweetness to it, but it packed the perfect caffeinated punch - not overly strong, but it had a delicious, robust flavor to it.  Delicious!Now, as tasty as my drink was, I'd be remiss not to acknowledge the fact that Blue Bottle is obviously on the pricey side.  Delicious to be sure, and certainly of better quality than the likes of Starbucks, but not all that cheap either.  Not that it would stop me from coming back again, not when I've finally discovered the drink to get to fully appreciate all that Blue Bottle has to offer!FOUR AND A HALF STARS rounded down for now.",4.0,2018-10-02,0.3329694908266337,0.5293508171415149,0.107,0.761,0.22142857142857145,0.9964,POSITIVE,0.9959989786148071,-246.56,129.6,9.55,165.3,21.82,38,129th and 130th grade,0.0,20.0,14.0,9.9,1855

Philz Coffee - Golden,"I used to love Philz, especially when they first opened on mission, the original location, you would even see Phil himself! It was great to watch someone go from having a spot to sell coffee in a grocery store on Folsom and 24th to owning the spot and turning it into his own coffee shop, then to expand into owning multiple shops around the city and in other cities! I even worked here for a time. That was years ago. First of all, we used so much beans for one cup- enough to make a whole family a whole pot of coffee in one cup- and to cut it we use cream w 60% milk fat! That's the whole reason it's 1)addictive 2)expensive. No matter, it was fun, original and it worked! Phil knew what he was doing. The difference between a small and a large is abt 3 coffee beans and 1/4 cup more water, so again- great marketing and great way to get that money. All of this is fine and still much better quality then the cancerous fake coffee they sell at nasty Starbucks. Fast forward to years later- the whole menu has been simplified. Everyone who works there hates their jobs, probably bc they're never gonna get paid enough, so that's understandable, can't blame them. But it certainly carries over to the quality of the beverages which aren't getting cheaper. I don't want to pay $5 for a stomach ache made by a sad underpaid and overwhelmed employee, especially knowing what the quality once was and has now been reduced to, as with any chain store. I'm sad to say that over the last 3 years especially Philz has declined tremendously in quality, but they're making so much money, who cares right? It's just a hype now. All it's done is raised the price of an average cup of coffee in every neighborhood you'd find a Philz. That being said, there's a donut shop across the street with no line that's very affordable although less ""cool"" and another one on the other corner owned by very sweat Thai women, they have very affordable food and beverages, don't care if you're the coolest hipster in SF, they are more than happy to serve you and you will get that small business appreciation feeling!",1.0,2019-05-20,0.12112929894179894,0.5413690476190475,0.16499999999999998,0.835,0.20333333333333334,0.9604,POSITIVE,0.9985671043395996,75.13,8.1,7.43,10.1,6.21,37,10th and 11th grade,75.13,8.1,10.1,6.21,2093

Philz Coffee - Golden,"Before I go any further, I feel like I need to start this with a disclaimer - I LOVE Philz.  Across every single one I've been to (including this one), I've never had a poorly made drink nor have I had to suffer through an awful experience.  As such, it feels both weird and uncomfortable to be giving them just a three star review.  It's just that, with all due respect, I'm not nearly as fond of where this location is as any of the others I've been to...Like any other fan of Philz that's out there, I've made my way through (most of) their menu and I've found my personal list of go-to drinks.  Mint Mojito, Tesora, Mocha Tesora, Gingersnap, Philz Harmonic...any of these will instantly put a smile on my face!  Specifically here, both the Tesoras and Mint Mojitos that I've had from here were just as good as the ones I've had from any other Philz.Unfortunately though, while the drinks and service have been (mostly) fine, I don't particularly enjoy coming here.  It's not Philz's fault, and the Tenderloin/Civic Center area is improving, but I hate how I seem to get panhandled every time I come/leave here (sorry if that sounds elitist, but it's true).  What's more, with their spot on Van Ness temporarily closed, the lines here can get longer than normal.  Add in how nearby parking isn't always readily available and coming here isn't exactly drama-free.If this happened to be the only Philz that was around, or if I happened to work in the area regularly, I'd be much more willing to endure the hassles in order to get my regular fix of Philz coffee.  However, with so many other locations around SF (and the Bay Area) that are much more accessible to where I frequent, I'll save making a return trip here for the next time I have to go to City Hall or do jury duty at McAllister.  Which, hopefully, won't be sooner and will be far, far later.",3.0,2019-01-11,0.05023448773448775,0.5129969623872063,0.2105,0.874,0.20228571428571432,0.8322,POSITIVE,0.9952273368835449,-251.64,131.6,9.14,167.5,22.28,43,131st and 132nd grade,0.0,20.0,14.0,9.9,1855

Le Cafe du,Pro: Came to watch the world up at a French cafe and the environment was amazing. Packed house.- latte is GreatCon: I asked the cashier what their best brunch option was (Sunday) and he said the tortilla espanol. So I said I'll take it. There are no prices on the menu so I find out as I pay its $16+ but I figure I'm going to be here for 2 hours so why not and the cashier suggested it as well so it must be really good. Reality check: there was no tortilla and it was the furthest thing from a Spanish dish. See picture. There's sliced French toast which tasted very undercooked and poorly made. And then there's salad and tomatoes surrounding the dish. The title of the dish was misleading and the eggs sorely undercooked. I would not recommend this dish.

Coffee,"Closes at 5 on Sunday! My friend and I came here to finish up some homework on a Sunday. I had done some research and realized most of the coffee shops with WiFi closed early on Sunday but this one was open until either 6 or 7 (this was a few months ago so I think they might have changed their hours). We got settled in, ordered our coffees and set up our homework, only to be told we needed to pack up because they were closing 1-2 hours early. I asked if there was a special occasion of some sort, but there wasn't really any reason other than wanting to go home early. I really hate that because we went out of our way to get to this coffee shop specifically because it was open later than everywhere else. It really just through us off.

To be fair, there have been some times where my drinks have been lackluster, but the baristas have always been eager to fix them. This is something that I really appreciate since I've gone to other coffee shops in the area where baristas will seem extremely annoyed if you ask them to remake your drink.Nowadays, I'm more of a tea kind of gal, but I would still definitely recommend the iced mint mojito if it's your first time visiting.

Philz,"If you've never heard of or been to a Philz Coffee, Mission Philz is worth a visit, because it's the first ever Philz Coffee that opened in 2002. The coffee, of course, is what everyone comes here for and although I don't drink much coffee, my husband swears by Philz. Unlike most other coffee shops, Philz does drip coffee and is a lot stronger than an equivalent espresso coffee drink. Also, unlike other coffee shops, Philz has a unique take on ordering coffee. As soon as you enter Mission Philz, if you don't see a line, go all the way to the end of the store behind the bench (look for the signs), and wait for a barista to call upon you. Once they call you, you tell them what kind of coffee you want and which size you want. Philz believes in ""making it perfect""; so, there's no milk and sugar station in this coffee shop. If you need more of something--like cream or sugar--you go back to the barista who made it for you and they'll help you out. If you're like me--that is you enjoy a creamy, sugary drink and would never drink black coffee--go for either the Mint Mojito or the Ecstatic iced coffees; I like to get mine ""sweet and creamy"". If you're not sure, the baristas are really friendly and will help you pick a coffee (or tea). After ordering, you head on over to the front of the store, near where you entered, tell them what you ordered and they'll charge you. (Yes, they rely on your honor to tell them what you got.) This is also your chance to get some food. In the last few years, most Philz Coffees--including the Mission one--have started carrying a selection of baked goods (like some yummy almond croissants from local bakeries), pre-made burritos, and freshly-made bagels. My husband and I sometimes get breakfast here when we're in a rush; our favorites are the Philz Bagel on Za'atar and a warmed-up almond croissant.After paying, head back to where you ordered and wait for the same barista that you ordered with to call your drink. There's a bench that you can sit and wait on while your drink is made; it usually takes a few minutes. Once you've had Philz, be warned that you may become a regular (like my husband)! One of the great things they've done recently is introducing a mobile app that lets you preorder and have the coffee be ready for pickup when you get there. This is a huge time saver! These days, my husband almost always uses the app to order.Lastly, while all the newer Philz's have chic, modern interiors, it looks like Philz has intentionally kept this first one true to its beginnings and the Mission. Both outside and inside, nothing seems to have changed since 2002, and while it may not be as fancy-looking as some of the newer ones, once you visit this one, it'll have a special place in your heart.",5.0,2019-02-04,0.23825113378684806,0.41330297788631126,0.134,0.868,0.18016666666666667,0.994,POSITIVE,0.999843955039978,71.28,9.6,7.72,12.2,6.39,48,9th and 10th grade,71.28,9.6,12.2,6.39,2757

Each roast they have, they also list for you the tasting notes so you get the exact flavors you're going for.

I feel for this biz, because while it's in a bustling area, there's competing forces that make running a business here difficult, like its central location and frequenting of homeless people to use the bathroom.

The art was by a gay artist with large, bold, cartoon-ish paintings; and I liked the brightness and humor in them.Tim M got the cajeta latte, which uses a slow-cooked caramel (like dulce de leche), and it was unique and very smooth.

I find that to be a really weird way to run a business.  It's disappointing because it's very cute and one of the few places that has whisked ceremonial matcha tea (most places just do a latte with pre-sweetened powder).  If already in Japan Center it might be worth checking out.  If they are closed and you are looking for a ceremonial matcha tea fix Kisako downstairs has that as well as there is some new place downstairs that has matcha frozen desserts.",2.0,2018-07-31,-0.055555555555555546,0.40884848484848485,0.13975,0.874,0.1635,0.394,NEGATIVE,0.9973245859146118,-5.16,38.9,9.13,49.9,9.88,16,9th and 10th grade,0.0,20.0,14.0,9.88,1100

We came in, ordered at the counter and the woman working there told us to sit and she would bring them to us. I noticed that everyone else there had some sweets but since we had just come from the YES event at Matcha Cafe Maiko, we were very full and sugared out. Next time, I totally plan on getting something to snack on as everything looked delicious.After about 5 minutes, the woman brought us our drinks in REAL GLASSES (my favorite!) I had a cappuccino and A had some genmaicha tea. My cappuccino was really good with just the right amount of foam and A's team was great as well.

Tan Tan Coffee,"One of my favorite cafes in Japantown. This cafe serves full teapots of tea, coffee, and a variety of desserts. They have about six to eight Japanese teas. My favorites being the matcha and hojicha. The hojicha comes in a teapot with a with an adorable teacup and the matcha comes in a traditional Japanese tea cup and includes a traditional dessert with beans. The coloration of the cups and the entire spot has a Victorian style that allows you to feel like you've stepped back in time upon visiting this place. The desserts are also impressive. Initially when I saw the term parfait I was assuming it was just going to be a boring mix of items, but I was wrong. The parfait I purchased had kiwi, strawberry and oranges in whipped cream mixed throughout layers of green tea ice cream. It was a flavor filled extravaganza on my tongue and totally worth the wait. A few final tips about this location is that it's not always open when Yelp says it will be. I always look to see if the half door is open when I visit Japantown and if I'm lucky like Alice in Wonderland follow the teas and crumpets to a delightful tea experience. Also, it's not a big place so I'd say it's good for groups under 5 as there are only about 16-20 seats in the entire place.",5.0,2017-04-14,0.2864583333333333,0.5553571428571428,0.234,0.845,0.24137500000000003,0.9701,POSITIVE,0.999919056892395,78.59,6.8,7.07,8.1,6.69,32,6th and 7th grade,78.59,6.8,8.1,6.69,1252

I wouldn't have known about this place if it weren't for Yelp because there are no pictures or advertising outside the shop. That drink is merely a subtle one-liner on the menu sitting on the counter.My favorite part about the drink was how the vanilla ice cream was so cold that it started freezing the matcha green tea around it. Great for a small sit down break while walking around in Japantown or to just chill and do some reading. There were only about five tables and no outlets, so not appropriate for busting out a laptop. More for some chit chat, sketching, or reading a magazine/newspaper/book.I liked the old-timey furnishings, but it made it seem catered to an older audience. It didn't have the frilliness of a tea room nor the hipster vibe of modern day coffee shops. More like the dusty victorian design.

As,"As Quoted:Overall:Great experience. I came to As Quoted, a cafe in Presidio Heights, at noon on a Tuesday.  Staff members were friendly and service wasn't too slow. The atmosphere was lively, but not crowded. It was sufficiently relaxed for me to do work (*write my yelp review). I'd expect weekends to be way more chaotic, so if you are lucky enough to work from home, or not to work at all, visit on a weekday! My only complaint is the price. It's a bit expensive. Food:I ordered avocado toast with smoked salmon, a banana muffin and a chocolate chip cookie. The avocado toast was pretty good. I generally don't order avocado toast on principle. I am pretty sure I can buy a really good loaf of gluten free bread, mash up a ripe avocado, add salt and make my own kickass avo toast. Or, better yet, buy some spicy guacamole and gluten free chips. I seriously don't understand the avo toast obsession. But I broke my rule because I wanted something with bread and smoked salmon (visit As Quoted on the weekend for a bagel and lox!). I was impressed with the toast. It had a consistent texture that didn't crumble after biting into it, even despite not being toasted! The toast also had more flavor than your standard gluten free bread (*cardboard). And the avocado mash had some unexpected red pepper bits that added an extra kick! And of course the smoked salmon was an excellent touch. I doubt I would have enjoyed the toast as much without it. The banana muffin was the best item I ordered. Dry and crusty on the outside, and soft and moist on the inside! It had the perfect ratio of banana chunks to muffin. I may go order another one. I have no self control. The chocolate chip cookie is pretty good too. Although I wouldn't call it a chocolate chip cookie. There aren't chips. It's more like completely chocolate on the inside. Okay, changed my mind. This cookie is mind blowing. I LOVE the amount of chocolate in the inside. What a concept! (Yes, I am eating the cookie as I write this).Gluten (aka the devil) Situation:100% GLUTEN FREE. Come through fellow celiacs!! Order ANYTHING from the menu. Without fear of being poisoned. Enjoy! Question:What does the name mean? Why ""As Quoted"" (which I just quoted. Ha!)

Chai Bar By David,"I went here back in Feb, before Valentine's Day with a friend. We both got hot elephant chai lattes, for there. The drink itself was good but undrinkable for like 30 minutes because it was WAY TOO HOT I burned my tongue and that wasn't all that was burnt that day. I went to go grab the drinks and they did not come with plates and the way their cups were, the arm to even hold the cup up was very small so the moment my skin came in contact with the cup, instant burn to my middle and ring finger. I had asked the barista if they had plates and just quickly said no and continued to make other drinks. I thought to myself, ""you'll be alright Mimi, you've dealt with burns before"" but as the day went on my fingers started to welt a bit. And here we are now into June and both my fingers are still not healed, everyone I've showed it to has told me it looked like second degree burns.

Chai Bar By David,CHAI! I'm obsessed with it. Coffee makes me jittery so I drink tea instead. Drinking Chai is one of my favorite ways to warm up during cold winter mornings. It relaxes me yet gives me the energy to start my day - Chai is magical.Chai bar is a one stop shop for everything Chai! You want a Chai latte?  - Come to Chai BarYou want to brew your own? - Buy the powdersYou want a boba? - Add it to your Chai LatteDon't take sugar? - They have sugar free on the menuYou want coffee? - Add it to your chai to make it a dirty chaiThe list goes on and on!I ordered the Chai flight for $7. I was pretty sad that the flavors were pre selected. Of course the best flavor was the original tiger spice chai. A second would be the cub chai which you can really taste the ginger. The third would be the white shark (though I honestly don't think the flavor is memorable). The worst flavor was the boldly spice. It tasted really diluted and no flavor at all.I also ordered the Elephant Vanilla Chai and really liked its creaminess and sweetness.

James Freeman, a coffee loving freelance musician, had enough of commercial, I call it corporate, coffee and decided to take matters in his own hands. His goal was to sell freshly roasted coffee beans to snobbish caffeine junkies like me who cared about the aroma and taste of freshly roasted coffee.  He made a vow: ""I will only sell coffee less than 48 hours!""Things went very well for Blue Bottle Coffee mostly because people loved their products, so much so that it expanded into San Francisco and then the rest of San Francisco Bay Area.

I liked the espresso and it came in a cardboard cup. Um, so I am like all about how people present the espresso shot haha. Well, it was a nice breakfast snack on Haight Street. I took my public transportation back and forth. I walked around Haight Street early morning and every shop was closed besides this cafe pretty much.

Their mocha is not sweet like other places, there is a wonderful smokey flavor that I believe must come from the roasting of the coffee beans.

Line wasn't even that long and tons of team members behind the counter but mass confusion between them and arguing with each other.  You would think with 5 or 6 people behind the counter that it would move quickly and efficiently.  Not so much - moving as slow as ever.  The person taking our order didn't even really know the menu.  Not sure what's up with this Proof Lab Equator location.  ___________________Previous - Currently standing in line out the door at the Proof Lab location.  We are regulars at the Larkspur location and it's better in every way.  It starts with the employees at Larkspur - Dustin and Jeff.  They actually care where as you're treated in this location as if they're doing us a favor by providing coffee.  They always run out of the tacos at this location where we've suggested that they double their order like Larkspur and it was completely dismissed.  The response was that we should get there before 10am and we asked don't you want a higher ticket and margin from us - seems like good business and common sense.  They always run out of Oatly here and we've asked how about proactively forecasting your need here and increase / order ahead like Jeff and Dustin do at Larkspur.  Guess the reaction - basically dismissed.  Lastly, the work area behind the counter is pretty disgusting- this location isn't clean and team again just doesn't seem to care much.  We're only here because my wife is addicted to Equator and our kids go to Mathesium so in a way have no choice.  The alternative is SBUX across the street but it's basically the same thing.  Yes, this is intended as an insult to basically call this Equator location a SBUX so if management is reading this then hopefully point taken.  Thank",1.0,2018-11-11,0.07261904761904761,0.4809386973180077,0.20174999999999998,0.782,0.18212499999999998,0.9821,NEGATIVE,0.9999871253967285,-67.92,61.0,10.35,78.0,13.22,38,60th and 61st grade,0.0,20.0,14.0,9.9,1781

Equator Coffees & 1,"I drove almost an hour out of my way to go to this cafe that I found on Yelp, searching on ""coffee shop"" and ""dog friendly"" and ""free wifi.""  The options were limited for north of San Francisco, and this was the closest.  Took the hour to get here, so I could work on a computer with wifi access, while babysitting a rescue dog, who gets anxious when left alone.If I could, I'd deduct all 5 stars due to the woman employee who gave me a hard time about asking about their being listed on Yelp as ""dog friendly.""  It came up when I asked if they had any doggie biscuits - I asked another employee and she jumped in, saying they don't have dog treats and made some crack about most dogs being gluten intolerant (not all dog treats have gluten, lady) and told me that although the dog was cute, it could not be inside.  I mentioned that the cafe was listed as dog friendly on Yelp and she and the others said they knew nothing about that but there was a water bowl in the parking lot area.I was standing in line and had already paid for the beverage (otherwise I would have just left). I took the dog outside, where the only place to sit is a few tables in the parking lot.  I got only a few minutes of work done, when the same employee came out and took photos of the dog - outside -  WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.  I was so creeped out by this that I left as soon as she did that and threw away the overpriced beverage.Very upset to be treated that way after researching and coming specifically to this cafe, and then be ridiculed for asking about dog treats, then have them ""document"" the dog by taking photo without permission.  The experience left me shaken and basically ruined my afternoon.  A coffee shop should not leave you feeling violated for bringing a dog when Yelp search  lists it in results for ""dog friendly.""",1.0,2018-06-27,0.28541666666666665,0.3992965367965368,0.1894,0.899,0.14925,-0.8964,NEGATIVE,0.9999796152114868,-75.7,66.1,8.26,84.0,13.97,41,-1th and 0th grade,0.0,20.0,14.0,9.9,1817

I don't like how the oat milk is a hit or miss there as the last few times I have gone, they didn't have any oat milk. I think their drinks are on the small side but I think it's because it's more a hippie European coffee shop. I feel like they should get a larger size and still have their traditional regular size. The price has recently gone up as well which I know how expensive it is within the neighborhood but I'm not sure how fast I will be back for a cup of coffee unless I'm really craving a mocha and they have oat milk.

I will share a small story though which I feel has nothing to do with deducting stars and hate when I see reviews where people take away from the business because certain clientele are inappropriate. A hippy looking, 40+ woman, with glasses approached me claiming I was killing her with my detergent. She then went on a rant as I continued to just sit and smile to not escalate her demeanor. What honestly is so shameful of the situation is that I am open to hearing and learning about organic products and how to be a better person to my environment. I ended up purchasing what she had recommended but in the end I feel the world would be a better place if we kept in mind that being right doesn't always mean you need to sacrifice being kind. During her rant I was told that shopping at Gus market is totally foul, that rainbow market is the last good piece of San Francisco, and even mocked for not knowing its location off the top of my head.

Spin City,"It was a confusing visit today. I arrived to see they'd removed half of their smaller washers and replaced the large stainless steel folding area with tables for drinking coffee at. They seem to have put some sort of bare wood counter where the washers used to be, but it's also a chalkboard for the neighborhood kids. It feels like this is a clear message that this is not a place for people like me who go there to do laundry. The wood is less than sanitary and I don't want chalk on my clothes or little kids under my legs.I understand it must be nice to be a part of the  neighborhood, with families stopping by with kids and dogs to buy coffee (who all comment how they love the tables, yet do not sit at them), so maybe that's why they are focusing their business on the coffee part.

Tartine Bakery &,"Overpriced. Poorly serviced. Overhyped tourist trap.It pains me to have to write this review. For context, I've looked forward to sampling tartine for 3 years as even though I'm a local now, I have been eating gluten-free for the last few years, and tartine bakery was not gluten-free friendly. I used to wistfully look at photos of their scrumptious looking creations during this time :(Well, now that I'm eating gluten once more this is one of the first places I thought of trying. And I can safely say I wasn't missing much.We visited memorial day weekend around 2.30pm and as usual there was a long queue, mostly tourists. Getting a table was really crowded affair and since they don't have a separate order pick up area, nobody monitoring the crowds or allocating tables, and the size of the shop is tiny, there were people waiting all around our table as we ate. Our every expression was on display as keen eyes waited for our thoughts on each dish. This is really not how I pictured trying my first croissant again.We ordered a lot of stuff for just two people. Chocolate almond croissants, morning buns, ham croissant, mushroom croquet monsieur, banana cream tart. We wanted to do the wait justice. Despite the large order, the cashier Odessa was quite disengaged and cold. Not a smile. I was further disappointed to see that everything other than the ham croissant was served stone cold. Morever, other than the morning buns which were lovely (if a bit heavy and BIG), nothing really stood out. It just felt like sense pastry sheets laid w (a lot of) butter.  The banana cream tart barely contained any toffee caramel sauce at the bottom.  The chocolate croissant was short on the chocolate. There was little delicacy to the baked goods and everything seemed to have been made with a very heavy-handed approach.We were so looking forward to this visit that the disappointment was even worse. All I came away with is ""it's better to walk alone than with a crowd going in the wrong direction""!",2.0,2019-06-04,-0.2408234126984127,0.4246460746460746,0.3982,0.866,0.2561666666666667,0.6177,NEGATIVE,0.9999969005584717,66.37,9.4,9.4,11.9,6.99,50,9th and 10th grade,66.37,9.4,11.9,6.99,2000

Tartine Bakery &,"TL; DR: Fine option if you live/work nearby but otherwise, don't be taken in by the thousands of reviews (7k+ at this time). There are other bakeries more worthy of your time and money. I've been going to Tartine's here and there for 7 years, led by their reputation, convinced by the lines at the door. But after my last couple of experiences there, the love affair is over.There is always a line, even on a random weekday afternoon. Servers are expressionless if not downright surly. Prices are very high. But most importantly, the baked goods are no longer outstanding. I'm not sure if this is due to a fall in Tartine's standards, or a rise in others'. Maybe both.

Tartine Bakery &,"The problem with me going to bakeries is that I tend to get too much and always shock myself at the register. Regardless, I never regret getting what I do. I would only regret not getting it to see how it tasted. In any case, this bakery always has a line but does move relatively quick. I think there was  ~25 people ahead of me and I got to the register within 15 minutes. You pretty much order on your way to the register. Along the way I got:[1] Chocolate chip cookie ($4) - It's huge, flat and delicious. I didn't think about getting it but 2 groups that were ahead of me got one and so I figure why not! No regrets! I even picked up a bag near the register.[2] Canele ($4.25) - Expensive but this is probably one of the best ones I've had. The inside is more cakey then custardy like I'm use to but the zesty cake flavor was soooo good and the outside wasn't that bitter. If they have any I highly recommend it![3] Gougere ($4.25) - It's like a hollow cheese bread. This was meh to me. It looked different on the inside compared to other pictures I've seen on yelp.[4] Frangipane Tart (~$8) - This was pretty good. I like the crust because it's very croissant like and the berries wasn't overly sweet. I think next time I will try the hazelnut one. I was just thrown off because the hazelnuts on top looked like corn nuts.[5] Baguette ($6) - Expensive as well but pretty good if you pair it with cheese. I prefer the softer baguettes like the ones you get with banh mi and at the Asian stores you can get them for a $1!I would have gotten a sandwich but I heard it takes about 15 minute to make. It feel very cramp and there's a fair amount of seating but not enough for my party. There's also outside seating but it was a cold day so I opted out of the sandwich. Maybe next time!

Every time I come in, the servers act like they are annoyed I am there, and roll their eyes when I ask them a question. I brought a client here for a business lunch. We were seated right away, but had to ask for service after waiting for 15 minutes. I ordered bread with butter for the table. There were 3 slices of bread with this order, and 4 people sitting at the table. When the bread arrived, I asked if we could have 1 more piece, so that everyone at the table could have some. The server rolled her eyes, before saying she would get more bread. After 10 minutes, still no bread. I asked again, and was met with another eye roll. We received our food, but still no more bread. I had to ask for the check before someone brought it. Upon inspection, I see that I was charged for the extra bread that I did not receive. The server corrected the bill when this was pointed out, but of course, this was met with another eye roll. It's like the servers here know that the bread is kick ass, so they don't even try.

Joy’s,"I had known about Joy's Place for a while and have even been here once before for their bingsu, but my most recent visit was for the sake of finding a good cafe to do work in.

Plating and presentation were cute and the treats tasted just as nice! Glad we got a tart when we could because their case sold out not too long after we showed up.I thought it was a pretty good place to study, though there was only one outlet that I could see.

Would not recommend.- Tiramisu 3/5: Homemade. The marscapone layer makes up 80% of the tiramisu, with the remainder being a small sliver of sponge cake.

We came in not that long before closing but they still made the shaved ice for us, which we really appreciated! Recently I visited again to try the honey bread, but they've stopped serving it. :( So the only item I've tried here is the:-Green tea shaved ice ($9) - as mentioned by other reviewers, the shaved ice texture is on the icy side (not my favorite). The green tea flavor is not strong, and the red bean and mochi pieces on top were also just fine.Overall it's a good option for dessert after getting dinner in Tenderloin, though they seem to be transitioning more to sandwiches now.

Martha & Brothers 1,"I knew about this coffee shop in the summer of 2003 when I did an internship and the art dealer needed a sponsor. Martha Bros. was a local sponsor and so I heard about Martha Bros. They put a Martha Bros. in the Sunset near 9th and Irving. I have visited sometimes to sit in the cafe, but I decided to get something to try today. It turns out they have a decent assortment of bagels and so I picked the $5 bagel with tomato, cream cheese, and egg...no butter on bagel. Then I tried the iced espresso. Not all cafes offer an iced espresso note. This one was served in a cardboard cup..um that's not fancy, but I'll take it. The cashier was attentive enough, and it was early in the morning. The bagel was good and I ate it. I don't need to get myself a bag of gourmet bagels to eat everyday in one week, so I can do this once every other week. The espresso was decent and I had some milk with it. Martha Bros. is a decent cafe in SF. This spot is nice to spend time in. It's near UCSF.

Blue Bottle 3,"I understand the hype. I've​ got to say, after trying it, Blue​ Bottle is worth any line to get your hands on some coffee. The cool aspect of this location is there are two areas to order! In general, I am obsessed with the simplistic design of this coffee shop and love the branding that they have on their coffee cups and paraphernalia​. Despite the line that we encountered, it went quite quickly. The barista that was taking our order was extremely friendly and took the time to explain the drinks and make recommendations according to our typical coffee preferences. She instructed my sister and me​ to order the New Orleans, and she was right on point! The New Orleans is an iced cold brew that we ordered with Almond Milk. Although​ it was made with Cane Sugar, I did not feel like it was extremely sweet but rather the ideal combination for an enjoyable drink. I was impressed​ by the taste of the Cold Brew itself that was strong but not thankfully not especially acidic or bitter in taste.

Blue Bottle 3,"There are two Blue Bottle Coffee locations in San Francisco Ferry Building literally within 20 -30 steps of each other and it seems like they often get confused by me and many of my fellow Yelpers! One is inside and on the north end of the building. The other one is a stand outside on your right as you walk north on the Embarcadero. They both serve high quality coffee drinks, but at any given time the line at one may be shorter than the other, so you may want to check both locations before committing to the line in front of one. Here is the review I wrote for the other location. The good buzz from Oakland!It was in Early 2000 when W. James Freeman, a coffee loving freelance musician, had enough of commercial, I call it corporate, coffee and decided to take matters in his own hands. His goal was to sell freshly roasted coffee beans to snobbish caffeine junkies like me who cared about the aroma and taste of freshly roasted coffee.  He made a vow: ""I will only sell coffee less than 48 hours!""Things went very well for Blue Bottle Coffee mostly because people loved their products, so much so that it expanded into San Francisco and then the rest of San Francisco Bay Area. Then in 2010 they opened their first New York location. Then in 2017 the unthinkable happened. They became an almost corporate coffee! Nestle purchased 68% of their shares!Corporate or not, Blue Bottle coffee tastes and smells wonderful. I discovered Blue Bottle coffee in 2007. Those days the choices were fewer and simpler. These days they have so many fancy names for the choices they offer that I've lost track, but the favorites that I recall are 17ft Ceiling and Hayes Valley Espressos. I usually ask for a long pull. It gives me a mouthful of fresh coffee flavor and the caffeine kick I seek! If you are around the Ferry Building, this location is a very good place to try their coffee. The baristas are very friendly and helpful and the location is great.",4.0,2019-04-12,0.2887795159386069,0.44650649350649346,0.0,0.809,0.24012500000000003,0.9964,POSITIVE,0.9882345199584961,69.52,8.2,8.3,9.1,6.44,42,8th and 9th grade,69.52,8.2,9.1,6.44,1948

Le Marais,"An exceptional feat--pain au chocolat (chocolate croissant) too dry on the outside and raw in the middle (baked at too high a temp?). People seem to come to be seen for brunch or simply to enjoy the cute Parisian cafe-style seating. FOOD: Croissants piled high, a dream of airy pillows of butter held together with flour... a dream shattered upon the first bite into this golden deception. As stated in the TLDR, dry throughout and a dense hunk in the middle. The pain au chocolat featured a generous squirt of too-liquid chocolate (the highlight of the pastry--who doesn't love sugar?). Haven't tried the prepared dishes, but as a business that markets itself as a viennoisserie (with an Instagrammable ""I croissant/heart SF sign"" outside), I would expect the croissants to be the star of the show. Despite the 3-star rating, the line is always out the door on weekends. I will not be joining it. I live nearby and walk the dog by the window nightly, where I see plenty of croissants on a sheet wrapped in Saran wrap. Fingers crossed that these go into bread pudding and not back on the display. SERVICE: Personable cashier who rung me up made the experience great! Service and ambiance are the redeeming factors at Le Marais, though I can't comment on table service.AMBIANCE: ADORABLE. I have to believe people come for the ambiance. I love the Cinderella blue paint, the reed-woven cafe chairs, the tiled interiors, and the charming 19th c. font. Aesthetics are spot on, and a photo on a weekend at 11am (dogs & strollers at the sidewalk cafe, enthusiastic conversations at cafe tables inside, the marble pastry display counter)... a perfect picture of gentrified SF.

Unfortunately, like far too many businesses in the Castro, the service is hit or miss. On my visit (and my previous visit last week) service was scattershot.

They seem to have a strict protocol and are not able to relax around it (at least the guy serving me wasn't).  He was also rushed despite the store being empty, and kept dumping the tea that was in the server into the garbage before it was drunk.  I was able to discern that the teas are high quality, albeit very pricey.  I would love if they had a different tasting protocol, maybe next time I'll request a more relaxed tasting of only two teas.

Song Tea &,"I tell all of my tea lover friends about Song Tea & Ceramics because this place is truly magical. First of all, if you're looking for a place to hide from the SF rain for an hour or two, this is the place to be. The space is simple, open, and spacious, homey, and also perfect for this Instagram shots. (+++) The tea tasting : $10! In my opinion, the tea tasting is probably the best thing here. I do agree that some (ok most) of the teas here are quite pricey so the tasting is a good option for you to try those $$$$ teas if you're wondering how magical they taste if they're $100 for 2oz. The tasting used to be free actually if you buy something afterwards but I guess they've changed since so many people do the tasting. The time frame usually range from 20-40 minutes depending on how many people are in your group and who's demonstrating the tasting for you. You can choose up to 3 different teas from their list (maybe even 4 if you're lucky) and the staff will guide you through the brewing process. They will usually serve you three rounds of each tea for you to get a taste of how the tea changes in flavors through the different steep / brew.  My favorite is the Buddha's Hand. The smell and flavors are absolutely amazing. I feel like I've learned so much more about tea from each session!

Song Tea &,"How have i not reviewed this place yet? this is the tea shop of my dreams!the space is austere, simple, elegant. there is a bookshelf in the back filled with tea books. some are even bilingual (which is really neat).i was waiting for friends so i sat down and started reading a bit. then my friends showed up... with more friends... and before i knew it, the serene tea shop had exploded into a noisy space.  one of the employees even fled to the back because she's a bit on the shy side. oops.i apologized profusely to the owner, who laughed and told me everything is ok and to calm down. he didn't realize my jitteriness is my default state. tea tastings cost money but you get to try multiple. I sat down with some friends and we had tea. the owner answered my random questions about flavor and brewing details. i ended up buying two different teas. one is their Shanlinxi Winter Sprout. The other one is a Lishan red (which i can't remember the name off the top of my head). the winter sprout is my favorite. i call it my cotton candy tea. i drink it but only when i have time to savor it. it is precious. the other tea my boyfriend loves (i like it too, mind you). it's sweet and fruity and subtle. when i run out, i'll have to order more. and i'll even be happy to pay for shipping.",5.0,2016-11-03,0.18166666666666664,0.491921768707483,0.11399999999999999,0.797,0.3392142857142857,0.9923,POSITIVE,0.9947988986968994,13.32,31.8,7.22,39.6,9.64,30,31st and 32nd grade,13.32,20.0,14.0,9.64,1288
Song Tea &,"Beautiful place with apparent passion for teas. Went in for tea tasting on a rainy day ($10 per person), the perfect mood for some warm tea.You can pick your own teas or get recommendations from the staffs who are very knowledgeable. They have unique white, red, green, black, aged tea, etc. We picked ours from different regions in Taiwan since we had a lot of Chinese teas already.The staff walked us through the three steeps of each teas. Now, this is where you can unfold the characters of the tea. Each steep will give you different impressions and aroma. It's like playfully teasing layer after layer, waiting for it to bloom and still appreciate it after the petals have fallen. (No, really.)Come with an open mind, enjoy the whole ceremony, do not rush this moment. :)The tea:1. Buddha Hand - A very well balanced tea with equal seriousness and playfulness. It has a distinctive chocolate-y aroma which were apparent on the second steep. Took a while for is whole character to come out but well worth it.2. Gahhh, this one I forgot the actual compete name. It has winter something...Anyway, the tea leaves are harvested in Lishan during winter. So it has high sugar compound, hence the sweetness of it. It also has the scent of pear. One of the most playful of the red tea or black tea I have tasted. The second steep was really delicious, but it comes to maturation on the 3rd steep.3. Okay, forgive me, I forgot the actual complete name again. But this tea shouldn't be hard to find. Just ask them for the tea which has been aged for 50 years. Repeatedly roasted years after years until the leaves have stabilized. The rich roast came on the first steep. Magnificent. Serious with a hint of high mountain crisp. It has a bit 'thick' aftertaste, so you may want to save this for last.",5.0,2016-10-19,0.3053769841269841,0.43797101449275366,0.158,0.786,0.3280625,0.9951,POSITIVE,0.9999880790710449,74.29,6.4,7.71,7.3,6.4,42,6th and 7th grade,74.29,6.4,7.3,6.4,1793

I thought it was delicious and I'm still not quite sure what Hojicha is but I assume its some type of tea.

The bacon bits were plentiful enough that each bite I took, there was always some in it. The bagel was toasted well and was a good vessel for the protein.

The only downside, which happens to all coffee, is that with the amount of ice they put in, the coffee became very watered down. The Frappuccino was mediocre, nothing special. It was extremely heavy and rich and the chocolate flavor just overpowered the taste. I was not able to finish it and I just froze it at home. The breakfast burrito is build your own.

The food is terrible after trying about 8 different dishes, super low quality sausage and bacon, over done eggs.The last straw was my mistake of ordering a pork ""panini"", which they forgot and I had to ask about, receiving it after my wife was finished eating. The menu description began ""our slow roasted pork bla bla bla"". Let me more accurately describe the sandwich - ""Cold store bought pulled pork in deli Italian roll with Sirracha mayo"". The pork was dry pulled pork, not slow cooked pork (big difference), came cold and not to mention completely not a panini with no grill marks.

They pride themselves on interpersonal connection and an environment that supports this concept, but are not inclusive to those solo patrons seeking a productive workspace. Their laptop policy requires customers with laptops to work in the back of the shop, which is termed the ""event space,"" which is a recent change in their policy (previously, it was no laptops allowed on weekends only). Rushing in one morning around 8:10am hoping to prepare before a 9am meeting, I asked about the event space and was told it was closed for a private event. I assumed this would allow accommodation to work within the shop, especially since every table was open except for one, but this was an incorrect assumption. I was told no laptops were allowed in the building until the event space opened more than an hour later. Had the delivery been a bit more apologetic, as this was their deviation from their policy, I'd have understood. Sadly, the barista was unapologetic and brash. I truly wish I knew this before placing and paying for my order. If I can't have a safe and productive space to conduct my business, then I'd rather not contribute to this business.Manny's is in an incredible location and in a beautiful building.

0,"Atrocious experience. 1-star. Manny - and the culture that he engenders at his establishment - is not just one that is bad at customer service - it goes beyond that: The way in which this place is run simply boggles the mind. Today, I showed up to do write a book report. For this I need a laptop, and a book. I ordered something. I sat down. Not too long afterwards, Manny approached me to tell me that there was a ""policy of not allowing laptops after 6"". Now this is his shop, and he can do whatever he likes, but why have such an asinine policy that makes no sense? He went on to tell the 8 or so other people quietly working, reading, watching, talking on their laptops that they had 15 minutes to shut down their laptops. Sure enough, everyone including myself did so, and when I looked back, the place had just become barren. Now it wasn't like he was saying ""this space is reserved for people eating dinner"", which is what a restaurant would say. He wasn't even saying don't read! He was saying you could not read _on a laptop_. This strikes me as extremely ideologically motivated. It's one thing to tell restaurant goers that the establishment is just for food. It's another to tell coffee-shop goers minding their own business that they cant read from their laptop. What about reading from an iPad? Kindle? Paper? Post-it?

Apparently owner Manny Yekutiel has been the subject of weekly protests over allegations of Zionism. Frankly I find the notion of political protest and point-counterpoint arguments rather refreshing because it's a 3,000 square foot venue for left-leaning activism with a full calendar of community events. Or you can just hangout and have lunch like I did in the bar cafe section upfront. Laptoppers abound here, but I managed to find s small table surrounded by s lot of vibrant local art (photo: bit.ly/2JdEN46).There were only four items on their lunch menu and there was a decided Middle Eastern twist to them. I ordered the $11 Cauliflower Salad, which was quite a diverse, colorful plate of harissa-roasted, turmeric-pickled cauliflower florets drizzled with tarragon green goddess dressing and mixed with tomato, cucumber, pickled onions, pepitas, and a lentil quinoa grain blend (photo: bit.ly/2Jep58D). To go with it, I had a bowl of the $6 Farming Hope Soup of the Day, which turned out to be a bountiful, lighter-than-expected minestrone (photo: bit.ly/2ITeuk4).

Philz 2,You have to tip them otherwise you will get shitty coffee. The cashier and the baristas have their own jargon or gestures to figure out who tip and who doesn't. Usually when you paid the cashier greeting different way obviously so the barista can figure out.I tip but didn't tip at the beginning and when I was only familiar with starbucks. The coffee quality is totally different. What they do is put a lot of sweets or put grounded mint. It only happened every time I didn't tip. Never happened When I tip and you can see how the barista and cashier communicate when you pay for your coffee.  Kind of funny. It's located in front of my place so I go sometimes bit I feel like I got forced to tip to nor get bad coffee?

I do have to say it was satisfying, however, I feel like the chicken might have reheated, prepackaged meat and not sure if they made the pesto in house. The salad was just greens with a little bit of dressing. The soft ciabatta bread and cheese was what saved it for me. Again, overall satisfying, but which it was fresher ingredients. Ambiance: 4This shop is super cute and if you're looking for a neighborhood vibe, this is it. The shop had huge windows that let in a lot of light, which I loved! So I was sure to sit by the window on the bench that spans across the wall. Though there were cushions on the benches.. they were worn out and flat so wasn't the most comfortable. The staff was really nice and helpful when ordering and delivered my food to my table. The cafe is made even more charming with the trolly that rides by from time to time. It was pretty quiet despite the trolly, which is was surprising. Overall, very cute and welcoming cafe.Extras: 5So one of my pet peeves is when you go to a cafe and they have bad wifi, Nook had very strong wifi which was easy to connect. However, on the weekends, there's a 2-hour limit, which really wasn't an issue for me, since I only stayed that long. They also had a good amount of outlets to plug into against the wall which is nice to see. Parking wasn't too bad either, considering the location. I feel like anything past Van Ness, parking get's difficult, but I was able to find a spot just up the street. Luck? Maybe. Overall I really liked this shop and highly recommend checking it out. I went around noon and it wasn't super busy, so might be a good place to meet up with a friend for lunch or work on your laptop to get somethings done.",4.0,2019-03-11,0.23864969135802472,0.641088888888889,0.363,0.726,0.313875,0.9983,POSITIVE,0.9900623559951782,78.79,6.7,6.78,8.0,6.52,54,6th and 7th grade,78.79,6.7,8.0,6.52,2291

Alamo Square,"Wow, the owner of this cafe has a really bad attitude. I placed an order on Seamless and when I arrived, he went on a rant about how the old owners set up Seamless and he ""wants nothing to do with it"". Apparently there was a change in ownership 3 months ago and the new owner doesn't want to take online orders. The problem is that Seamless and GrubHub still accept orders from here, and he refused to contact the sites to remove his business. He said ""it's not my responsibility"", told me to call them, and then made me pay a second time.I understand the situation is not his fault, but as a business owners keeping the SAME BUSINESS NAME, it's your responsibility to cover all aspects of the business, including systems that old owners left behind.

As I waited several would-be patrons join me there and then leave me there. After ten minutes the staff shows up and slowly begins to set things up on there end with the doors remaining locked and not so much of an acknowledgement of my presence.

In conclusion the espresso drinks they make are not worth waiting for like you're the last thing in the world that matters to the business, the most dominant flavor in their beans is actually ""burnt"", and it's actually not hard to make a piece of toast with 1500 calories worth of sugar, salt, and saturated fat slathered over it taste good.

Trouble Coffee,"This place is pretty shitty all around. The coffee is usually burnt. The person making the toast is also handling cash from patrons with their bare hands without washing. The staff has also been unacceptably rude. I'm a pretty patient person and I haven't dropped in here in a rush, only when I had plenty of time. I've been here at least a dozen times before, but after what happened today, I will never go back. I ordered toast and waited for longer than a half hour with no warning, not because they were too busy, but because no one was working the toaster for the 20 minutes after I ordered. I needed to get going and politely asked if I could have a refund. Even though they hadn't even started my toast yet, the cashier intentionally tried to embarrass us by announcing to the entire coffee shop that everyone would be delayed because of us. It only took 30 seconds to grab $5 in cash out of their wallet and hand it to us. We weren't being rude, we weren't being pushy, we just didn't want to wait any longer in a stuffy, loud coffee shop instead of spending the beautiful afternoon out on the beach. This place didn't use to suck but it does now, and how much it sucks feels intentional.

Trouble Coffee,"I'd been here once before, loved the cinnamon toast, didn't mind being ignored by the sulky but quiet barista. I was with two friends and didn't really mind. I wanted to go again to get another piece of toast, so I suggested meeting a first date here this afternoon. The experience was so bad it made ashamed for the city of San Francisco. I kept hoping a tourist will never experience the incredible rudeness of the barista. He ignored us for a few minutes when we got there, sitting at the counter, and he was just wiping the counters. When he finally asked what I wanted, as I ordered ""a decaf....."" he barked that they didn't have decaf and snarled at me. He didn't offer another suggestion (I know they have tea). Then my date ordered toast. We were four chairs down from the corner where the Square pad is. The barista looked back at us and said, ""If you want to pay you gotta come here."" So my date got up, walked three stools, and paid. I went outside to look for water, and when I came in, my date was exiting the bathroom in the back. The guy shouted, ""Hey! You can't go in there! I'll get in big trouble! Like, you could get me fired!"" I shot back, ""There's no sign, there's nothing that says customers aren't welcome."" ""YOU COULD HAVE ASKED IF WE HAD A BATHROOM!"" I replied to his back that shaming customers is never good for business. All the while, some kind of acid punk rock was playing so loudly we couldn't talk.

Little 1,"The strawberry watermelon slush with added boba $7.50 was okay. I appreciated the substantial amount of salted cheese. It was more like a salty blended cream cheese. I got random, large bits of cream cheese, which were actually kind of good. The boba are prepared too soft for my personal preference.The drink itself got warm quickly in my hands as I walked around Union square. I think they need to make sure they refrigerate the individual components of the drink before it is blended so that it stays better chilled. I think I saw them use fresh watermelon which is a plus. I don't know about the strawberry. The in-store menu price at $6.50. Even with the $0.50 charge for boba, the total for the drink seemed to be more than the price posted. Tax?The cup is too tall.

I ordered the black coffee, always a good way to measure a restaurant's way with the little things, while they ordered a variety of the boba offerings.My coffee was marginal, at best, but that's not why you're reading this review.

It's a smaller storefront with an area that can probably fit a litt less than 10 customers inside to order at the counter and wait. There was no line when I arrived around 5PM on a Thursday. I ordered:* brown sugar milk tea with boba (75% sweet)* creamy green tea (75% sweet)* original egg puffs My order came out to a little over $15. The lady working was quick with my order and I received everything within ten minutes. I had to wait a little bit for the lady to take orders of the customers that came after, but I wasn't in a rush. I enjoyed my brown sugar milk tea and the boba was sweet, slightly chewy. The creamy green tea was alright. I liked that it had a stronger tea taste, but the cream wasn't as salty as I'd like. The egg puffs were not anything great either. It almost tasted like a pancake and I have definitely had better at other boba places. Overall, I'm glad that there's another boba spot, but everything was average. Their prices are slightly higher than most places with a regular milk tea being $4.80 (not including the topping...).

Little 1,"tldr; I waited 20+ minutes for my drink when it wasn't even during busy hours (3pm on a Monday), my drink didn't have any tea flavor just milky and too sweet for 50% sweetness. Overall this place is not bad but not good.Little Sweet opened up right in the same building but downstairs of where I work. It's super convenient to come downstairs and be able to grab a cup of boba and stroll back to work within a minute, but that's not what happened.It wasn't exactly busy when I went. It was a Monday afternoon around 3pm (my Swarm check-in tells me I was at Little Sweet at 3:07pm to be exact) there was a group of 4 in front of me before I ordered. I stood by the door waiting for 10 minutes and realized I have a meeting I needed to get to at 3:30pm; thought to myself... I'll make it, I'm so close to work. 20 minutes passed and I still didn't have my drink. Finally at 3:24pm they handed me my Roasted Oolong Milk Tea with boba (50% sweet, less ice, substituted fresh whole milk for $0.50). My total drink came out to $5.80 (more expensive than Asha!)When I finally took a sip of my drink, I expected more ""tea"" taste, but all I tasted was milk and super sweet boba. Honest opinion, I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it, and that's never a way to describe boba.In conclusion, I probably wouldn't recommend this place since there's so many other boba places around (i.e. Asha [my favorite  and only boba place I'd recommend], Boba Guys, Sharetea, Black Sugar)I'll probably give this place one more chance in the future but if I end up with the same experience then they have lost a customer.",3.0,2019-04-23,0.16334986772486773,0.5305451127819548,0.161,0.812,0.207,0.9806,NEGATIVE,0.999931812286377,66.41,11.5,6.92,13.9,6.65,29,13th and 14th grade,66.41,11.5,13.9,6.65,1595

There was no line when I went, but my drink took awhile to come out. There was one lady making all the drinks while the owner was training the other employee. They also serve egg puffs and ice cream.I ordered the Strawberry Watermelon with Salted Cheese foam. The drink would have been better if it was colder, but the smoothie was room temp. The boba here is also hella soft and chewy - I usually like it a little harder. I'm always comparing cheese foams with Happy Lemon's, and the foam here just tasted like whipped cream. Some improvements could be made with customer service. The workers are all azn and do not know much English. The price on the screen was different than the price that they charged me and it took awhile for them to understand the issue. There was no apology.

Jacob was fabulous...helping us order the perfect things. I got the avocado toast with no cheese, no egg...and an oat milk mocha with melted dark chocolate...well, all I can say is it made me very happy. The chef/baker even gave me some house made hot sauce that made my avocado toast even better! Let me just say that I love and appreciate it when there are a few nice vegan choices!

Good croissants aren't THAT hard to come by but they definitely had some more interesting pastries such as a Tumeric Monkey Bread that I really wanted to try-Avocado Toast - This was FANTASTIC. I don't know if it is the bread or the combo of toppings but this may have been one of the best avocado toasts I have ever had. It is definitely expensive but honestly so satisfying that I would not hesitate to get this again. The portion is big AND it is pretty to boot!-Drip Coffee - They use Intelligentsia (I believe) and it was very good and satisfying. I do wish they would do re-fills for orders staying in the store but I also didn't ask.Overall, everything was great and the above came out to ~$20 which isn't cheap but also isn't outrageous.

0,"My roommate and I were actually really excited to try this place since we live close by in the Richmond. From the reviews and photos it looked really cute. We came here on a Sunday morning looking to try out a new study spot. We both got a 50/50 and shared the kaya toast. For the price of $6, the toast was nonclimatic. The 50/50 was great though. What knocked off one star for me in this review is that they never made it clear they do not allow laptop use and studying on the weekend. We would have appreciated a sign or knowing that before we bought stuff. It wasn't until I asked for the WiFi was that communicated. The staff asked us to put our laptops away once it got crowded which was basically an indirect way of asking us to leave. To me, it really defeats the purpose of being a coffee shop if people are not allowed to do work or hang out for at least a few hours.

0,"Beautiful, adorable breakfast/brunch place with creamy bread and photogenic, quirky baked goods. My friend and I were craving savory food, so we ordered the breakfast sandwich and egg pocket. I also got a black sesame horchata out of curiosity and my love of anything black sesame. Overall, this cute place is definitely worth checking out and splurging on at least once.The breakfast sandwich was warm and toasted to perfection. The red pepper spread was too spicy for me (I'm not a fan of spicy food), but my friend loved it. It's like a gourmet twist to a breakfast classic, a bit expensive though for the size (like $8).I was a little skeptical at first of the egg pocket being cold (I'm not a fan of cold asparagus or cold bread) but the biting into the freshness of the bread combined with the creamy egg salad made me forget all of my initial doubts. I inhaled that delicious egg pocket.The black sesame horchata was the most delicious (then again, it's literally a hybrid of two of my favorite flavors, horchata and black sesame so I'm biased). I'm so glad that I wasn't ""cheated"" as usual and the tall glass had the perfect amount of ice in it rather than way too much. It was creamy, sweet but not too sweet, and tasted like rice-y black sesame. I was okay with not being able to taste the cinnamon, since I'm pretty sure it would clash with the sesame.If I come back to treat myself one day, I will definitely try their famous pandan toast and yummy-looking cake.",5.0,2019-04-20,0.3348304473304473,0.6102513227513227,0.173,0.697,0.31546153846153846,0.9973,POSITIVE,0.9999864101409912,69.96,10.1,8.42,13.3,6.98,34,8th and 9th grade,69.96,10.1,13.3,6.98,1474

0,A place that feels that vibe of California hip. The Mapo chilli makes you wish chilli was always this good. The Koya Toast with an espresso is what weekends should always be.

The end was more dark, dark chocolate--comparative to eating 85% cocoa, with a smoky after taste. I had a cappuccino to lead after to see how it would hold up, the flavors had become a lot more complex being dispersed through with milk. A lot more balanced and pleasing.

Karma,Feeling healthy but wanting something delicious? Well karma cafe is the place to go! All the drinks here are absolutely delicious! A bit on the pricey side ($7.50 for a smoothie...?!) but understandable because of the ingredients used. One of my favorite drinks here is the lavender lemonade. The floral crisp taste is perfect for a nice sunny hot day. It's refreshing and delicious! The mango avocado smoothie is very subtle in flavors but it does make me feel super full after drinking half of this. They had samples of their PB&J and this was amazing.

Karma,"Awful Coffee and Service.  I took my mom here on a Sunday thinking it would be a nice laid back place.  Oh no.  First of all, after we paid 4.50 for a cup of dark roast coffee that we explicitly asked for right from the get go.  She tasted it and said it was pretty weak. Instead of asking for a refund, she  went up to the counter and asked if this was indeed a dark roast.  Some woman behind the counter at the top of her lungs said that this was a great medium roast (she said it was a dark roast when I paid for it) and no one had complained ever before. Really?  Was all that necessary, not only did it stop up the entire conversation in the cafe and get all eyes pointed on us, over a freaking cup of coffee but how rude and unprofessional.  Karma cafe my ass, don't go here if you are expecting what you paid for and decent service.

The bread is toasted well and it's a basic turkey sandwich so nothing went wrong. It tasted good, nothing special. Others: They have an ATM in the shop. They also have a lot of snack options aside from the pastry selections. They sell granola, chips, and cup noodles!Overall, it's a great place to be. With good drinks and variety of food options.

Les Gourmands,"I had such high expectations. A French bakery run by actual French expatriates. The last time I had had a chance to buy a true brioche loaf was at Le Bon Marche. I had considered taking one back to the States in my suitcase. At Les Gourmands I bought the almond croissant, a mini pain aux raisin, an oranais. As others have noted, the croissant dough is not light, buttery and flakey, but has instead a 'soggy' quality to it. The almond filling was not a pure almond paste, but rather an almond mix. To me, the dough seemed too sweet. The pain aux raisin was forgettable. The service was lovely and I was greeted immediately upon entry with a 'Bonjour Madame' just like in France.

Ok who am I kidding.  First thing I noticed was cutie pie behind the glass in the black beret to my left. ""Voulez vous ku che avec moi c'est soi"" The aroma of sweet smelling bread just lured me in with every breath and every step to my chosen pastry. Which I just noticed is not on display anymore!! hmmm were they just selling me the oldies but goodies?? I don't care!! It was delicious anyway!! I'll do my best at explaining it to you. The pastry resembles a flat cinnamon roll, minus the sugary coating. With little round chocolates in between the creases. The bread was moisty moist. Not too sweet just perfect. On top drizzled lightly white crocodile. Jk I meant to write white chocolate but auto correct wrote so I kept in in hopes someone will find it entertaining. Or chuckle with an inner laugh or a LOL one.Behind the glass everything looks so tasty. It is too. The little pastries are just that small and deli. The super friendly guy. He was all smiles from the moment I walked in. It was almost as if I'd walked into another country all together, like maybe Paris?? Or a different era. There was a ‍ lady too, next to the happy  , she also giggled with us. There's definitely something special about a place when you walk in and it takes few words to burst into pure giggles. He was so sweet get it? The sweet pastry shop? Ok so he let me sample the croissant. It was like the movies. The croissant made a perfect crunch in my mouth. Then I sampled the brioche.

Les Gourmands,"Owned and operated by French expatriates, one of them a fifth generation Baker, it was with heightened expectations that Les Gourmands was entered Tuesday morning, the location at 280 5th Street a bit difficult to access by car during rush hour but at the same time resulting in high foot traffic and fresh selections continuously being baked to replete supplies.Decorated by an artist known as Nairone, his minimalist approach allowing focus to remain squarely on Tarts and Viennoiseries spread across a lengthy counter with names and prices displayed on small stands, it was while perusing the options that a woman identifying herself as Catherine offered guests samples, the corner of an Apricot Croissant crunchy and well-laminated with just a bit of Jam adding sweetness.Located at one of SoMa's most bustling intersections and thus able to justify higher prices than the typical Bakery, $7.80 per Tart and $5.00-$7.00 per Croissant on par with Tartine and more than Neigbor or b.patisserie, it was after assessing the choices that nearly $30 was invested, first bites of the Almond Apricot Tart finding Preserves relegated to the center and the edges a little dried out though the flavor was pleasant.Continuing with Fruit, a $6.40 Chausson Aux Pommes challenging Les Gourmands assertion that everything is organic and locally sourced since the interior tastes like store-bought Pie Filling, it is fortunate that the seasonal Chestnut variety fared much better as a result of toasty Cream inside crunchy, separated layers.Apparently hiring only ""zero experience"" bakers according to their website, an 18-month apprenticeship intended to train new artisans while also decreasing labor costs, it was while watching one man coach another in back that the ""Almond Croissant"" was cut in half, the thick Custard not only unexpected but overcooked while the $1 Chouquettes fortunately lived up to their acclaim as one of The Bay Area's best baked goods thanks to a golden exterior flecked by Sugar Pearls and an center that is eggy yet open and light.",2.0,2019-04-07,0.20109595959595955,0.4829278074866309,0.0,0.912,0.152,0.9721,POSITIVE,0.9373794794082642,-261.45,131.2,13.95,167.3,24.0,85,-1th and 0th grade,0.0,20.0,14.0,9.9,2050

Sylvain looked at my modest order and gave me a complimentary one for good measure. Generous and they were bitefuls of Gallic joy. On my second visit a month later, I saw I could get five Financiers for $8. Financiers? Sounds like a Wall Street pyramid scam.They're actually small French almond confections somewhere between cakes and a cookies. Imagine my joie de vivre when I got home and found a dozen in my little bag (photo: bit.ly/2I4cEMO). That Sylvain. Very generous though it felt like a cautionary tale for me as I started eating them like Pringles potato chips. So buttery, a lot like Madeleines but with a Paula Deen bitch slap to them.

Aroma Tea,"*** In Short ***Long-time neighborhood shop offering an extensive array and knowledge of teas.*** In Depth ***Having eaten in the area many times over the years, I've seen and passed by Aroma countless times, but never actually gone in. Not that I have a dislike of tea: far from it! But it was only until recently, learning that tea *wasn't* the cause of my teeth stains, that I started getting back into it. And what better way than to stock up on loose leaf teas?!Stopping in one day after lunch nearby, my friend and I sat down to a (free!) tea tasting session with the surprisingly hip and hilarious owner of the shop, sampling almost a dozen varietals, and learning quite a bit about the origins and differences during that process.With so many teas available, ranging all across the quality spectrum, it can definitely be hard to choose, but they help find tea samples that meet your particular interests. That said, even that can be a little off, as I didn't like most of the initial teas enough to commit, only coming across a couple at the very end of my tasting session. Part of the reason for this is probably due to them brewing a much stronger tea than I myself prefer, so keep that in mind while taste testing.***Accessibility Info***Venue - Not very large, but very spacious, with just the single counter in the back for the register and tea tasting, so accessibility shouldn't be too big an issue.Bathroom - Don't think they actually have a public one.",4.0,2018-03-25,0.22944563152896483,0.40006105006105,0.0,0.837,0.18500000000000003,0.9841,POSITIVE,0.9936787486076355,44.95,17.6,9.53,22.2,8.09,38,13th and 14th grade,44.95,17.6,14.0,8.09,1469

Aroma Tea,"Aroma Tea Shop on 6th is - in this Yelpist's humble opinion - a national treasure.  Truly exceptional customer service combined with an extensive and high quality selection of teas make for an unforgettable experience.  Whether you are a tea connoisseur or just a casual sipper, your visit to Aroma Tea Shop will make you smarter and your day better.Tucked away on 6th, right off of the hustle and bustle of Clement, is the wide-windowed, yellow canopied storefront that can best be described as being to tea what the Library of Alexandria was to books prior to its tragic immolation.  This tiny storefront contains a magnificent collection of the finest and most desirable cured leaves of Camilia Senensis.The store, as one of the owners Haymen kindly explained to me upon one visit, is set up in many ways like a modern dispensary.  Canisters of tea and a small selection of brewing and drinking-ware line the walls of this tiny tea shop.  The centerpiece of the store is a tasting bar, where up to four people can comfortably sit and sample teas of their choice or, better yet, teas recommended by whoever is working.Your dialogue with the host over tiny steaming cups of freshly brewed tea is the real heart and soul of the Aroma Tea Shop experience.  No matter who your host is, they are going to know everything you could possibly want to know about all of the available varieties, and they are more than happy to share this wealth of knowledge with anyone who cares to inquire.  It's basically like going to a bar, except your bartender is serving you free samples of finely aged Scotch from his private reserves, which he picked up during his latest trip to Scotland, and telling you all about it.  And instead of getting wasted, you are being uplifted by the soothing smells and flavors of teas of all varieties.  Time flies as your senses are stimulated and your mind expanded by taste after taste of Aroma Tea Shop's carefully cultivated selection.My recommendation is that you go when you've got time to kill.  I've easily ended up spending 45 minutes to an hour there every time I have gone, shooting the breeze, sipping brews, and educating myself one of the world's oldest and most popular beverages.  Be sure to buy a couple ounces and tip your host a dollar or two for providing a 5 star experience.  These people are experts without the snobbery, and their product is of the highest quality.",5.0,2018-01-08,0.2442246642246642,0.5900772765246449,0.2165,0.806,0.19823076923076918,0.9943,POSITIVE,0.9999480247497559,-344.34,165.1,11.17,210.0,27.62,86,-1th and 0th grade,0.0,20.0,14.0,9.9,2409

Aroma Tea,"I thought this would be one of those intimidating places where the proprietor would try to explain the finer nuances of various tea leaves to which I would respond with a glazed stare.

Grand,"Located on Mission Street (a few blocks north of the 24th Street BART station), Grand Coffee is a small shop that offers your usual coffee/espresso based-drinks. They also offer non-coffee beverages if that's your jam, but my guess that if you are choosing to visit a place with ""coffee"" in the title, you are looking for a cup of Joe. I've tried their regular coffee and their Americano, and I thought both were well done. The Americano was smooth and not overly acidic, and the coffee was good even without cream and sugar. They offer Cuban pastries as well, and while I haven't tried them, I thought it was great that they offered something different than your usual cafe snacks. The service has been consistently friendly when I've visited, and there's a casual and welcoming vibe to the place that makes it very appealing. It's a small space, so I don't think it'd be great if you are looking for a place to work for long periods of time.

Boba 2,"Intro: San Fransisco has for the past 5-10 years been growing at a very high-speed rate and consequently become overly saturated in new businesses, one of which being boba shops.  It seems like nowadays a person could meander to the corner of a block and stumble upon a place that sells boba.  Boba Guys is one of those businesses that began during the tech industrialization of the Bay Area.  Since opening, they have crushed the boba game and have become an instant go-to whenever I am craving that good tapioca.  Drinks: Black milk tea is my choice of order whenever I pass by a Boba Guys.  I know, extremely basic but wait a minute, for good reason.  I've had the black milk teas of at least 70 different milk tea stores around the Bay Area throughout my lifetime, some good some bad.  Boba Guys hits it right on the money and delivers a great standard milk tea.  The tea flavor is strong but not overbearing to the point of bitterness, which is probably the most important attribute of any tea drink.  The boba is delectably chewy and slightly sweet, adding that fun and interactive part to your boba experience.  For sweetness, I like to choose 50% and let the tea, milk, and boba carry the other half of the load.  Overall, Boba Guys makes a brilliant black milk tea, one of the reasons why this store has become the boba Goliath it is today.",4.0,2019-05-23,0.20189909297052155,0.45081355426183006,0.1215,0.766,0.20955555555555555,0.9916,POSITIVE,0.9995915293693542,-159.27,96.1,9.78,121.9,17.87,33,-1th and 0th grade,0.0,20.0,14.0,9.9,1349

Bluestone 1,So this place is new and it does not deserve the poor rating it has now.  The drip coffee is delicious and the avocado toast is piled high with avocado.  What more can you want???  I went yesterday and got a large drip coffee (Black).  I was told it was the Flagstaff roast.  Very smooth and flavorful.  The avocado toast had lots of flavor and there was sooo much avocado.  YUM!!!!  I love the backsplash behind the counter and the hotel it's connected to is doing a super cute display with books.  The space is small and there isn't a lot of seating.  It's not a place you go to camp out for hours.  I grabbed mine to-go and will definitely go back,5.0,2019-03-11,0.19057926200783343,0.5448744588744588,0.0,0.822,0.23375,0.973,POSITIVE,0.9998570680618286,-28.0,47.7,7.74,60.3,11.28,12,47th and 48th grade,0.0,20.0,14.0,9.9,650

When we went back to correct our item they promised, but then promptly forgot, to ""run it right out"" to us... it sat getting cold.  Additionally, if you want to sit and eat your food there you need to use the neighbor hotel's lobby/lounge.

Definitely make sure you shake it up or stir well as the syrup was on the bottom upon delivery. On first sip, it was pretty good!

Beanstalk Café - Inner,I became a regular here really quickly in the 2 weeks of winter break I had from teaching. I needed a nice little spot I felt was cozy and comfortable enough to sit and do work but also drink enough coffee to keep me going and eat tons if needed. I really love their set up with their couches and lounge style chairs. They also have a long table set up where 8 people can sit at and then a few group tables as well. The first time I saw that there were little signs on the group tables saying reserved for groups so I didn't sit down and looked like an idiot standing there looking for somewhere to sit (place was packed) and the lady behind the counter told me not to worry that I could sit there but that they put the signs there to let other people know that it is a group setting table so if a group came you couldn't hog up the table. I was totally fine with that and down with sharing a table with anyone. It was awesome that this place was packed but still was peaceful. There were many people working but also a family in there as well with their kids just drinking some coffee and doing their thing. I think it's amazing how the atmosphere here is the same no matter what just really chill and everyone about sharing their space so everyone has space. Oh now on to the things I ordered: Mint Mojito Iced Coffee: So I ordered this here because this is my usual coffee at Philz and I wanted to see how someone else did it and I actually like this one much better. The mint flavor wasn't as overpowering which made it taste really nice. It was the perfect balanceRegular dark roast roast of the day: I love my coffee black and each time I go their dark roast of the day es muy muy delicioso. The darkness of the coffee matched the darkness of my mood of having to do work on my breakBagel Sando: I kinda rolled my eyes that the sandwich is called a Sando but then I remembered there are people like Rachel Ray who say things like EVOO and that's the norm now. I'm from the east coast so I always judge bagels anywhere else but the sesame bagel was delicious. I got bacon in my bagel sandwich and it was the perfect bacony goodness.,5.0,2019-01-10,0.3643304843304843,0.5394824311490978,0.0,0.776,0.22453846153846155,0.9978,POSITIVE,0.9996263980865479,68.74,10.6,6.62,11.9,6.34,35,10th and 11th grade,68.74,10.6,11.9,6.34,2137

I'm appalled, and I was just watching. Seems like they are CAPABLE of providing decent service.. as long as they know you.

Unlike boba guys, the drink was super water downed and the strawberry puree did not taste like strawberry at all.

No line and no customers inside the store, there were plenty of tables and they had a wide selection of games to choose from, so it looks as if this place might get crowded possibly on the weekends or at nighttime. It's nice how they offer custom drinks or their pre-made set of combinations. The drinks came out within a couple of minutes of ordering, however, at 75% sweetness, they tasted a bit watered down already. There was also a lot of ice in the cup, but I guess we could have ordered less ice.  We didn't orders boba, and opted for jelly instead, so I can't say anything about the boba.

I tried the golden oolong and the matcha blossom and I honestly have to say that both drinks are pretty decent. The golden oolong has a pretty strong tea flavor and it has just enough sweetness at 50 percent. It's not watered down nor is it disgustingly sweet. The matcha blossom is my other fav drink, it's similar to boba guys strawberry matcha latte. It has exact same layers except this one is slightly sweeter with the purée but the matcha flavor is still there and it's nice and not too strong.  I've been here a few times and I do t mind making my way back here for other drinks in the future!

The lower level is the member's area, which is where I head when I really need to buckle down and focus. Upstairs is a good people watching and connecting point for me, while the member's area allows me to grab a seat to work from my computer without distraction.If I didn't come by so regularly, I'd happily enjoy dropping in as their drop-in rates are highly reasonable.

Covo Café & Tap,"The first time I came to Covo last August, I was genuinely impressed with the expansive work space that was constructed and designed for budding start-up entrepreneurs. There was plenty of room for laptoppers and even conference rooms in the back. Somehow the edgy vibe was enhanced by its location near the somewhat hellish intersection of Sixth and Mission intersection where who knows who or what can walk in panhandling. At that point, they allowed Jamie W. and me just hang out on a couch in the space and explore the space at our leisure (photo: bit.ly/2qPNDfO). Apparently those days have ended.Back then, Jamie enjoyed a $9 bottle of North Coast Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout, which was quite delicious (photo: bit.ly/2qPVo5C). Months later, we came back here to meet for tea and noticed that the owners had found their footing by renting the space for private company parties and limiting us non-start-up types to the cafe portion in front. The problem was that the parties were not so private, and it became louder as the evening progressed. The bar scene became a bit obnoxious with entitled, ADD-addled youngsters elbowing their way onto the bar where we were sitting (photo: bit.ly/2rpcfJg).We had no complaints about the cheery server who attempted to give us attention despite the distractions. This time we shared a $3.95 beaker of the Jasmine Pearl Green Tea (photo: bit.ly/2qPU4j1), and it was quite soothing with a bit more flavor than the Whitman-inspired Leaves of Grass herbal mix we tried last time with lemon verbena, peppermint and tarragon (photo: bit.ly/2rpjm4w). I still think it's a very worthwhile space, and perhaps on a non-rental night, it could even be nice just to hang out in the cafe section. But not that night. Their fearless company leader was leading a chant. Time to go. TEA & BEVERAGES - 4 stars...nice selection of beers, and they make a fine loose leaf tea in French Press beakersAMBIANCE - 3 stars...liked the space but when it gets crowded, whoa...SERVICE - 3.5 stars...server was kind but had to deal with lots of demanding youngstersTOTAL - 4 stars...kudos for having a business close to Sixth Street...and a fine cup of tea",4.0,2017-05-16,0.38527065527065524,0.4235517568850902,0.141,0.869,0.23645454545454545,0.9393,NEGATIVE,0.9288979768753052,62.21,11.0,10.74,15.1,7.89,68,10th and 11th grade,62.21,11.0,14.0,7.89,2179
Covo Café & Tap,"This is a good idea. Those of us running our own businesses, sometimes out of cafes, want to snuggle up to those of you running your own businesses in co-working spaces. We invented you after all, when we launched our businesses from laptops in cafes in the early 2000s. It warms our isolated little hearts to see that the next generation of entrepreneurs took our ideas and ran with them.

It's fun to work alongside your hustle and bustle.I'll forgive the barista her eyeroll when I asked  her what cascara was.

Cinderella Bakery &,"I recently realized that Cinderella has delicious baked goods, and I'm obsessed. I've lived in the city forever, grew up in the Richmond, and visited this bakery once with family in the distant past. The ownership changed years ago, and the restaurant/bakery grew in popularity over time. And apparently the quality improved significantly with the new ownership, because I don't recall being impressed when I originally ate here or seeing the line out the door and down the block. I'm not really a dessert person, but what I love, I love a lot. Napoleon cake is up there. And Cinderella's is the best I've had. This afternoon, I finally tried the strawberry custard croissant; it was sold out other times I stopped by. I think the custard is the same they use in the Napoleon, but there's a lot more in the cake. I wish the croissant were a bit more moist. Overall, it's pretty good. I'll probably attempt to get here in the morning so I could try this pastry at its most fresh. My best friend's mom said the restaurant next door will close and sell the space to Cinderella. Hopefully more space will be positive all around.

Cinderella Bakery &,"I wish I had a faster metabolism so I can come here everyday. Ugh. The Fried Piroshky selections at Cinderella's are a must. My favorite one is stuffed with Potatoes and Mushroom. The texture of the dough is so soft and chewy; it's seriously the most delicious savory pastry I've ever had in my life. I've also tried the Beef with Cheddar, although I wish it had more cheese. It looked like it was filled with all ground beef but maybe the lady gave me the wrong one? So I'll probably try ordering again to see if it's any different. Regardless, it was still delicious. Another one of my favorite things here that I can't really find anywhere else is their Blinchiki with Sweet Cheese. Omg. This is honestly my BIGGEST guilty pleasure. It's the most buttery crepe stuffed with a heaping amount of sweet cheese filling, literally foodgasm. And to think it's already so rich as it is, it's also paired with a side of (I believe) Russian sour cream & raspberry jam. This is the ultimate dessert for a cheat day, I can't get enough of this one.

Unfortunately I had a really bad experience a few days ago. I ordered using the Phil's app because my card got stolen, once inside I asked if I can order food by ordering two drinks through the app(more expensive than the avocado toast) I was told we normally don't do it but we will this time so I completed the order, then it just went down hill from that moment. I was told by another manager that it's against policy then after a short conversation she said ok just this one time. So I waited about 20 minutes and asked about the toast in which a different girl came out and said ""no"" in a rude manner and said they will refund me.

The young man at the counter (didn't ask for his name) is very attentive to your chocolate needs. He crafted my hot chocolate like it was a delicate oil on canvas.

These range from stuffed animals to art work on the walls. Their mascot is Harriet the flying alpaca (which by now should all make sense).

The kids loved all the different cats and the environment is very cute and clean.Their favorite part was watching all the cats jump up when it was snack time and they loved being able to give a couple treats to the cats!The hot cocoa is homemade and was delicious with whipping cream and a marshmallow!Definitely recommend this as a fun activity for cat lovers and kids!!!,5.0,2019-05-20,0.34861111111111115,0.6886363636363636,0.0,0.656,0.447,0.9855,POSITIVE,0.999420166015625,42.89,16.3,9.7,18.8,7.61,10,-1th and 0th grade,42.89,16.3,14.0,7.61,412
KitTea Cat,"Okay, how can anyone give this place less than 5 stars?! It combines pretty much my two favorite things in the world - fluffy kitties & tea! A few friends and I dropped by for a 1 hour session with the kitties around 6:30 pm and we were pleasantly surprised to see most of them awake and ready for playtime. We at first drifted over to the tea station (set up by the windows) before diving into cat bonding time. I loved the Hojicha! Definitely give it a try. The rest of my 58 minutes inside KitTea Cat Cafe was spent trying to make friends with the cats. It felt like a lot of unrequited love but alas, I still had so much fun staring lovingly at them. (maybe one day they will love me back) I loved how our KitTea representative would get the cats to hop up onto our backs. It felt like such a unique experience! We also learned from him that KitTea Cat Cafe rescues cats who would otherwise by put to death and rehabilitates them to be comfortable around humans and I just absolutely love that! I wish I could give another star just for that reason. By the end of this interactive experience, I was ready to embrace my future as a cat lady.

As I was cruising down Taraval, I got off at 23rd and found this spot just a block away in front of McCoppin Square.

Neighbor,"4.25/5Came by on a Friday morning around 10am for a quick breakfast. Luckily there was no line and I was in and out in 5 minutes. The shop is small though they have 3 large benches outside for seating along with their extras setup (water, cream, sugar, napkins, etc.). Unfortunately no shade or outdoor heaters available. Parking in the area is mostly street and can be difficult. Easy to access by MUNI though. Service is really friendly. They have a small menu but if you're coming for baked goods you just have to look on the rack to see what they have.I got the following items:1) Everything Croissant: The only item I semi regret. It's still pretty good but it can't compare to the other two items. The top layer is very flaky but most of the flavor is there so once it flakes off the remainder is pretty flavorless. It's not an overly buttery croissant so the inside is airy but otherwise a sticky doughy texture. There's a bit of filling consisting of cream cheese and green onions but it's not enough to carry through the whole croissant (though personally I also use a ton of cream cheese on my bagel). I'm also not a huge fan of the grainy texture cream cheese takes on when it's baked. (3.5/5)2) Sauerkraut Smoked Cheddar Peppadew Tart: I wasn't sure how this would work out in pastry but I absolutely loved it (given I am a fermented food nut). In terms of texture it's similar to the croissant. Not buttery but fluffy with a flaky (though less than the croissant) top coat. I wish the filling as a bit more dispersed but overall I loved it. It's almost like an elevated version of nacho cheese and kimchi. The sauerkraut peppadew combo is very kimchi-like though a touch sweeter. This with the smoked cheddar made for a perfect balance. The bread itself is quite sweet compared to the salty spicy filling so the extra doughy-ness works a bit more favorably here (4.25/5)3) Twice Baked Pistachio and Blackberry Croissant: Like a cross of Seattle's Bakery Nouveau twice baked chocolate almond croissant and Arsicault's almond chocolate croissant but with fruit. The texture if just like Bakery Nouveau's a sort of heftier crust with crunchy ridges. The filling has that more grainy sweet paste texture like Arsicault's but it offsets the sweetness with the nutty toasty pistachios and the tart blackberries. In principle I am still a chocolate over fruit girl but damn this was good (4.75/5)Overall I really enjoyed my visit here. While I've had better croissants elsewhere I loved the unique flavor combinations they offered here. I definitely want to come back to try some of their hot food options or their kimchi toast (they serve this at room temp but you can get it heated up).---The Re-return: Twice Baked Pistachio and Blackberry Croissant if you are a fruit person; otherwise go for Arsicault's chocolate croissants---",4.0,2019-05-27,0.3678240740740741,0.5416822284469344,0.24033333333333337,0.785,0.28375,0.9977,POSITIVE,0.9984456896781921,68.4,8.6,9.34,10.9,6.7,65,8th and 9th grade,68.4,8.6,10.9,6.7,2838

Neighbor,"Good but not as outstanding as I expected. The very hyped pistachio blackberry twice-baked croissant is good but not worth a special trip, and I would only come back if in the area.There's no seating inside the bakery but there are many tables outside. However, in the morning (which is the best time for visiting bakeries) the seating area is covered in shade, so it might not be the most pleasant environment for enjoying pastries.From most to least liked, I tried:Recommended:-Pistachio blackberry twice-baked ($4.85)- tastes good because the filling is good - it's moist, sweet, and slightly tart, and the flavors of the pistachio and blackberry go well together. I did think it was a little too sweet, especially with the powdered sugar on top, The croissant itself is slightly dry by itself but is good together with the filling. It is a bit overhyped though - I've had better twice-baked croissants elsewhere (e.g. Baker Doe's).Better than OK:-Butter croissant ($3.50) - very crispy and light. While it does taste of butter, the flavor isn't /super/ buttery and it's a bit on the sweet side. It's good but not as good as I expected, and I think Arsicault Bakery and some bakeries in New York make better versions.-Ginger pull-apart ($4.25) - reminds me of a denser, slightly bread-like kouign amann. The base is coated in sugar, and the bottom half is more syrupy, sticky, and gingery. The ginger flavor overall was not strong.Not recommended:-Mushroom tart ($4.50) - flavorful filling, very cheesy and with a decent amount of mushrooms and onions. The pastry portion was crunchy and kind of flaky. But it was served completely cold (on a warm plate), so the cream-based filling was completely hard and not at all pleasant to eat.",3.0,2019-04-19,0.24658128908128907,0.5539314427069529,0.23483333333333334,0.735,0.268,0.9958,NEGATIVE,0.9999799728393555,64.14,10.3,10.51,14.3,6.91,38,10th and 11th grade,64.14,10.3,14.0,6.91,1737

Steap Tea,"After walking up a hill in Chinatown, my friends and I decided it was time for tea. Came on a Saturday afternoon and there was a few people lined up. It is a small area with a few tables in front and a bar area against the wall with seats. It was a dark and loud area for a sunny afternoon. It was super heated in there. I saw a fan that I'm not sure if it was broken or they chose not to turn it on??? My friends and I were looking for a sit down place to chat but it was so uncontrollably stuffy that we had to head out. It seemed like other parties decided to do the same after receiving their drinks.I ordered the Purple Rain (butterfly pea tea with lemon). Not many places serve butterfly pea tea so I was excited to order it! It tasted decent enough for me to order again. However, my friends thought it tasted too sour so I guess it's a preference. My friend ordered an almond milk tea which tasted like regular jasmine milk tea.Wouldn't go out of my way to go again, but am willing to give it another try if in the area",3.0,2019-04-17,-0.10203703703703706,0.4382241215574549,0.175,0.812,0.2637142857142857,0.9752,NEGATIVE,0.8206438422203064,79.4,6.5,4.93,5.9,5.79,17,6th and 7th grade,79.4,6.5,5.9,5.79,1027

Steap Tea,"There are two prominent things in sf: boba and cannabis. In a city where every other billboard (and street corner) is promoting weed delivery and where malls hand out samples of cannabis face oils, it was only a matter of time before someone mixed boba and cbd. Not gonna lie, it was only the Green Queen CBD that drew me into Steap -  so, half an hour before it closed, I dragged my boyfriend from Inner Sunset to Chinatown to try it out.The drink itself has a matcha base with lemon, mint, and sugar, topped off with a sea salt crema similar to Happy Lemon's. I recommend asking the barista to seal the drink after you take your pictures and mixing properly before drinking the rest - I only shook it once and ended up with some sips that tasted like the normal Green Queen drink and others that hit me with a full taste of that CBD. It tasted much better after mixing and surprisingly, the flavors meshed very well together. But at $9 for a medium and $10 for a large, prices can be a little...steep (lol I couldn't resist). Other drinks ranged from $4-5. We also got the Mint Julip - very refreshingBaristas were very friendly; seating area and bathroom were both clean. The majority of their ingredients seemed to be organic, so there's a reason why their prices are a bit higher. There's also a photo booth so feel free to take all the pictures you want promoting this instagrammable drink.tl;dr - if you're in the area I recommend coming here instead of Boba Guys.

Checking in, selecting rooms and seats, and even texting the cafe to order and get your food and drinks brought to you is seamless.

Workshop Cafe,"tl;dr Sudden, don't care about the customer, changes that are all about their profits, or lack thereof. Retail staff is the only good thing about the cafe. I will rarely go there in the future.Workshop Cafe had not made changes fast enough. In September 2018 they suddenly offered three free hours instead of the 10 free hours which they have had since their start in 2013. They also started making changes to their packages and pricing for the conference rooms. They also added PRO packages and blocked off certain seats. In my opinion they should have reduced the number of free hours a few years ago.In February 2019 they suddenly stopped making their own food (which I liked) and started offering food from SOMA Eats and later another cafe/restaurant. Personally, I do not like the taste food they changed to, especially the breakfast food. Also, lamb at a cafe like this, sorry, no. I've made a greater effort to not eat at Workshop Cafe. They had a survey about the food, but the only thing I think they did was to add a couple of dishes.In addition, they also suddenly stopped allowing you to work in the conference rooms unless you have a reservation; this makes sense on the weekdays, but they are almost always not reserved on the weekends. The main reason I (and my friend(s) who joined me) used the rooms was to get away from the music that's blasted. I also used the whiteboards; thankfully this location has a couple of other non-movable ones.At the end of the day I understand the higher prices, but the food and conference room changes were done without true consideration for the customer.",2.0,2019-05-12,0.12392857142857142,0.6307319223985891,0.1944,0.873,0.209125,0.4196,NEGATIVE,0.9999946355819702,66.37,9.4,9.11,11.6,6.73,36,6th and 7th grade,66.37,9.4,11.6,6.73,1606

Workshop Cafe,"I am absolutely infatuation with this cafe. You honestly don't find a lot of cafes with a similar concept, especially in that area of the city. If you're looking for a place to study or utilize the online web, this is the place to go. When you walk in, there are seats where you could hang out with friends or order and enjoy your food. If you would like to go into the laptop-use area, you simply put in your phone number and a message would guide through the steps! Perks: first 3 hours of your first visit are free, so you could enjoy without any repercussions (even if you don't enjoy it as much). After 3 hours, there is a rate you would have to pay in order to stay. Though I love the concept, I wouldn't say I'm the biggest fan of the dishes my partner and I got. I got the Gochujang Noodle Bowl which had ramen, roasted chicken, a variety of vegetables, and the special gochujang sauce.

Now if I can just get all employees, not just the owner, to make cappuccinos out of Almond Milk, it would be a 5/5. I don't understand why one employee refuses to make them. Obviously you can froth Almond Milk. Look at Starbucks! I could do it myself if I had the machine. It really is annoying to not be able to get your favorite drink because one person doesn't either a) know how to make them/isn't trained or b) just doesn't care/like to make them.

A month ago when I was getting my coffee there, Azis came behind me, put an X-acto knife to my neck and said: ""Give me all your money!"" When I looked at him shocked he said: ""Relax my friend. It's a joke."" And walked away laughing. I told him, I'm not your friend, and if you do something like this again, I'll call the cops and have you arrested. It's completely wrong to joke with customers (or anyone for that matter), like that.

I happen to know R as he lives in my neighborhood. R. is suffering from PTSD and sometimes talks to himself quietly, but is completely harmless. When I asked Azis why he was calling R. crazy and other names, he responded: R. is my friend, I can call him whatever I want. Besides, This is my business, I can do whatever I want here.

As such, the vibe here is inimitable and very special reminding me of a San Francisco all but vanished. I remember most memorably when Val went the extra mile to help a Chinese woman and her daughter from Jiangsu province (Shanghai area) who spoke English haltingly, or not at all. I brought Margaret Zhou and her daughter (An actual Theoretical physicist in the body of a very young teenager!) over to help her redress a nasty tenant/landlord issue where she was being grotesquely ripped off and rent gouged- living in a totally illegal- utterly delipidated unit unfit for dogs.Val proceeded to reassuringly make them both feel at ease with an exemplary generosity of spirit that was, frankly, beautiful to witness. I was so overwhelmed I just let Val 'troubleshoot' the situation as the ideas just cascaded off her like shots of warm energy. Sadly the matter was never resolved, as the women just moved to New York where the daughter continued her post-graduate work. We both never saw them again.Yo!

I was strolling on California Street one Saturday afternoon and inadvertently exploring the random shops that pop up suddenly in the Outer Richmond. This was one of them.

Breakfast,"I love a good tater tot action in my breakfast burrito. Breakfast Little's is really the perfect to-go breakfast IMO: 2 eggs, cheese, mushrooms, tater tots, bacon, garlic aioli spread. My husband highly recommends getting the sriracha sauce which gives it a little kick and it also complements the creaminess of the garlic aioli. Size-wise theirs is also perfect for me. It's filling enough to satisfy hunger but not overly hefty where you feel greasy and heavy and want to take a nap until you've digested it down like many other bf burritos I've encountered. It's odd, but I'd rather a smaller burrito so there's a hard stop to its completion rather than have that unsatisfactory uncertainty of when to do so. My husband always gives me a hard time when I inquire about the option of junior or kid sized burritos rather than purchasing a full sized one and to ""just stop when full"".

Also the fact that they have a bar in the back shows this place knows how to turn up in the day and night!I haven't had the coffee here but I don't think it's as good as blue bottle.. also I wish they sold more pastries and baked goods rather than just donuts.Overall a great meet-up spot for the day and night!,5.0,2019-01-26,0.3048611111111111,0.4527777777777778,0.0,0.833,0.167,0.9586,POSITIVE,0.9995438456535339,70.81,11.8,5.87,14.5,2.46,5,11th and 12th grade,70.81,11.8,14.0,2.46,510

Red Door 1,"Great place to go and get anything ranging from an afternoon coffee with a rando, to a low-key drink, to a full-on happy hour with friends. Not sure how it manages to satisfy all of those needs but somehow it does. I usually get a quad espresso (pro tip: they charge for espresso shots in doubles so getting a triple shot is not a good idea for the value-conscious!), which always comes out great. I've never struggled to find seating either in the area around the main bar or at the back and the ambiance is cool. Have nothing negative at all to say about Red Door. The only other thing worth noting is that they give away their spare pastries (yay for free donuts) after ~3/4pm and their cookies are delicious.

Red Door 1,"Venue is great - shared with Minna Gallery - so there's art to look at if not otherwise events going on... limited seating makes this mostly a spacious place to absorb, grab and commute. Coffee service - very quick especially if you use apps to order ahead and well prepared with gourmet grounds: Verve, Four Barrel, etc. I tried a dirty chai latte (chai with a shot of espresso). Pleasantly surprised with the chai flavor not compromised by added caffeine. Well balanced, smooth, and pre-sweetened.OCD alert - some people I know complain about that if the seam of the coffee cup is aligned a certain way, coffee can drip into shirts etc. but this cup *actually* has markings for barista to align the sip hole for coffee lids... I guess there are more people who care about this than I originally thought. Personally, I am not particular as to coffee seam/sip hole issues, but I admired the ergonomics of the coffee cup lid. Guess these are the things that make coffee worth $5 :P but at least I feel it better justified with all the extras you get at Red Door versus some other $5 spots in FiDi...!",5.0,2018-10-26,0.23757440476190475,0.5386309523809524,0.20650000000000002,0.79,0.24974999999999997,0.9844,POSITIVE,0.9999549388885498,63.73,10.4,8.77,12.6,7.28,30,9th and 10th grade,63.73,10.4,12.6,7.28,1099

Red Door 1,"A solid coffee/bar spot. Came here with my co-workers during our afternoon coffee run. The place is very spacious having a bar in the back as well as an art exhibit on the side. Very friendly staff! I got the maple latte and a donut that was maple with bacon. Weird sounding, but it was great actually. The latte wasn't too sweet or too strong which is the way I prefer it. The donut was great! It had a mix of sweet and salty.

Red Door 1,"Our daycare backup options fell through at the last minute so I watched my son for the day and wanted to take him into the city for the morning and afternoon.  We went to Red Door Coffee, a place that I used to frequent quite often for both coffee in the morning and afternoon and drinks in the evening.  However, this last time I went there I was rudely KICKED OUT with my 2 year old son at 845am while having coffee and while my son was mid-bite in his salted caramel donut (which is terrible and sticky, btw).  I was confronted by someone claiming to be the manager that children were not allowed in the coffee shop, because the art gallery is 21 and over.  AGAIN, this was 845am in the morning and everyone was peacefully drinking their coffee or eating whatever pastry they ordered.   I asked him ""are you serious? it's 845am"" and also ""who is telling us to leave?"" he claimed it was the Owners of the place.  Everyone started looking at us, what I hope was in shock, that an asshole was kicking out a father and toddler from having coffee and a donut in the morning.  I am hoping that this was just a lapse in this inexperienced manager's judgment and not something worst like being racist, which also crossed my mind.  I tried calling into the establishment a few times and no-one picked up, and only got voicemail, but I hope they see this review and re-think how they approach this next time.  I know for sure that I certainly won't be going here anymore as their COFFEE SHOP is clearly not kid welcoming.  PS - I was trying to snap a photo of my son eating his donut, but actually caught him looking at the guy instead as he wouldn't even let him finish his bite of the shitty donut before asking us to leave.",1.0,2018-07-11,-0.14238095238095239,0.44686948853615516,0.16233333333333333,0.866,0.19,0.4841,NEGATIVE,0.999941349029541,-228.97,124.9,8.73,159.6,21.43,38,124th and 125th grade,0.0,20.0,14.0,9.9,1719
Red Door 1,"Very cool cafe! I also love the selection of pastries they have. The pastries & donuts are a bit pricier (normal hip-SF-bakery price), but they're totally worth it. My favorite is the pistachio blackberry croissant! It has the perfect balance of very different flavors: crispy, sweet, fruity, and nutty. Yum!~~~ UPDATE~~~ Seems like they no longer have the pistachio blackberry croissant, but they now have ham and cheese croissant that's also pretty good! The pastry is slightly glazed in between the flakey layers, so it gives you hint of sweetness along with the savory flavors.
