Native Twins Coffee,"[""This place to caters to all types of eaters. I've never seen so many toast options AND get to enjoy it in damn good gf sourdough. Their matcha is perfect. They even have a variety of other intriguing wellness lattes and unique coffee drinks. Without crossing over to the dark side of sugary gross lattes. The space is small yet comfortable. I'm always happy with every visit."", ""$6.50 for a turmeric matcha seems a bit steep but... I guess Lower Haight is coming up in the world. I had to put my headphones on because this place is teeny-tiny and the two gals working there were ranting back and forth about work drama. That's fine just not super professional. No biggie though. They have WiFi which is why I stopped in. The barstools are not very comfortable though - this is the kind of place that obviously wants their customers in and out."", ""It's not a far cry to say it's one of my favorite coffees in the city. Beans are great ( Temple ) & truth be told, I'm addicted to their butterscotch latte - 1/2 sweet, with almond milk, and every time - they deliver with a smile. All of them, which is a f'in rarity these days. The coffee isn't the only thing that's warm here :) I just moved closer to the neighborhood and couldn't be happier to start my mornings/kick start my afternoons with one of their bevs. Plus, it's a locally owned by amazing women, and I can't not support them. Take my money guys, I'll be back for another tomorrow ;)"", ""This place is fantastic - for coffee, toast, and friendly baristas/owners! It is owned and operated by a lovely set of twin ladies. This hits home for me as my twin and I have always dreamed of opening up our own coffee shop :). I ordered the dirty turmeric chai and it was delicious! A perfectly balanced drink. They happily accommodated my request of 2% milk - it's rare these days to find that as places only carry skim and whole milk.We also order the Pesto Tomato Toast and holy moly it was superb. The pesto was so good! And they use the perfect bread for avo toast - nicely grilled. As a millennial, I approve! They also have gluten free bread to accommodate those with dietary restriction.This cute cafe had a constant flow of folks coming in and out and for good reason! I highly recommend coming her for your joe and toast :). Best of luck to these ladies!"", 'Stopped in on our way out of San Fran because it was close to our AirBnb. The coffee was GREAT. I got a latte with an extra shot made with oat milk and it was super good. My roommate got the cold brew and enjoyed it also.Honestly, the only thing keeping this from a 5 star review was the avocado toast. I got it to-go so didn\'t even look at it until we got in the car. I probably just misread the description, but it was a couple slices of avocado on a piece of bread... I know, that\'s literally ""avocado toast."" It\'s just not the normal mashed plus some extra seasoning/veggies/whatever that I\'m used to. Like I said, coffee and everything else was great though!', ""Cute very friendly coffee shop on Divis. I got a cortado and it was very good. I've heard their food is also good. There is a small bench with a table on the sidewalk. Nice neighborhood spot. Very relaxed."", 'Just discovered this tiny place as I was walking down Divisadero. The pastry and the mocha were a bit too sweet for my taste but pretty good nonetheless', 'I come here a couple of times a week before my morning walk, and it is a perfect way to start my day. \xa0Very approachable team, superb coffee and espresso selection, although I always get the cold brew (sorry for taking so much of it!). \xa0They have all the milks (oat, cream, almond, etc. etc.) if needed. \xa0Also have pricey but DELICIOUS baked goods like donuts, bars, and natural pop-tarts etc.Not a ton of seating, have a good bar in the front and side to have a seat, but perfect community coffee shop for a cup to go.', ""I really loved Native Twins! I just stopped in for a cold brew in the morning, and I enjoyed the whole experience! The flavor of the coffee was incredible, the service was quick and friendly, and I loved the ambiance. I will definitely be back next time I'm in San Francisco!"", ""The lattes at Native Twins are absolute perfection. I used to get the espresso latte, but I stopped drinking coffee/espresso several months back and switched to the matcha latte (also have tried the turmeric and chai latte). Whatever the latte, it's always delicious and the perfect temperature (I find that a lot of coffee shops steam their latte milk way too hot, which is a big no no). The matcha latte, specifically, is smooth, earthy, and not overly sweetened. I've had a lot of matcha lattes from other coffee shops in various places and I always find myself judging them against Native Twins' because it's my gold standard that remains unparalleled. \xa0I could be biased because, beyond the drinks, the owners/baristas are wonderful: their service is warm and quick. The eponymous twins run a lovely coffee shop that epitomizes what a great local business is and makes me proud to live in the Nopa area."", ""Okay so there are several coffee places to choose from on Divisadero in Lower Haight, but this one is definitely my favorite. First, the coffee shop is super cute, the walls covered with record albums. Second, the coffee is really good. It is a bit pricier than I might normally spend on coffee but its definitely of quality. The only downside to the place is that it's not very big so I wouldn't plan on hanging out there. They did have some outside seating on the sidewalk however."", 'Love this spot. Pretty small but with a large personality. Very kind staff, good coffee, and yummy avocado toast. Got the garlic variation which was a bit intense recently but the traditional is extremely tasty.', 'One of my favorite coffee shops in the city! Their coffee is just perfect! Not weak, not too strong (burnt), just right! I also love their little muffins! Perfect place, great location, nice service! Totally recommended!!! :)', 'I love Native Twins. Their coffee is amazing, trust me, I am Italian. Their avocado toast is the best, trust me, I am a Millennial. Jokes aside, I really like this spot, their home made granola is excellent, and so are their pastries, from the same lab as Cibo in Sausalito.The Mill Valley twins are fun to chat to and they have an extensive record collection, plus it\'s really nice to be able to order ""the usual"", as there isn\'t the barista turnover you see in other coffee places in the area.I totally recommend it!', ""Great vibes here all around. Plenty of dogs and good food and snacks. Women owned business. Great ambiance great coffee free WiFi. I ordered pluot toast, turmeric green tea latte with oak milk. I discovered both pluot jam and oak milk on my visit there. They were kind enough to explain it to me. I can't wait to go again"", ""I love this place. I try to come as much as I can because this really is my favorite coffee shop. As a former barista/coffee snob, this place has everything you look for. Great beans, great people, and that intimate feel that makes a local coffee shop part of the neighborhood. You can't miss with their cold brew!"", ""Tried this spot a little while back and it was okay! The spot is easy to miss but once discovered, it's super cute and the staff is really friendly. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed by the coffee. I got the coconut & butter latte and my sister got the vanilla bean. The flavors just weren't there. When I tried my sister's, it tasted exactly like mine -- just a plain latte. Bummer because it's a $5 coffee. The morning bun was delicious though! Maybe it was an off day but I don't plan on returning to this location."", 'These delightful twins have added matcha, chai, yum pastries, and yum coffee plus great juju to the block. I highly recommend making this a regular spot. \xa0also a fab park-let to enjoy your treats outside!', ""I really love this place! Delicious lattes with so many different milk replacement options. Soy, heavy cream, almond milk, etc. This beats sight glass for sure! Tasty toast and pastries as well. It's a local business owned by 2 lovely twin sisters that are super nice. Support!"", ""Native Twins is a cozy little cafe nestled in the hills of the Haight district. Jen (who usually helms the coffees/teas) is a magician of a barista. I've never had cappucinos or pour over coffee quote like hers, and she shows her expertise and care without a doubt. Ashley made my toast today and I was beyond impressed. As a consumer, I've always enjoyed simple yet delicious foods, and these toasts theyvenconcocted are just that. I ended up not only getting the avocado toast, but the garlic butter and then a third on the sweeter side - cinnamon! Everything was amazing. The decor is very sleak, the ambience terrific, all with the steady backdrop of classic rock&roll. (Check out their posters on the wall!) Even though I live across the Bay in Berkeley I will for sure be back!""]","['5.0 star rating', '3.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '3.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating']"
Home,"[""Another cafe that has been on my bookmark in like forever, and I finally had the time to check it out.We came Tuesday morning around 10am hoping that it would not be packed but it was. As we were in line I tried to look for a table and was lucky enough to find one as a group of people were just leaving.We ordered birthday latte (duh! that's why I wanted to go here, lol), cookie monster latte, hot chocolate, cinnamon toast, egg in a basket and condensed milky way toast. Everything was really good. The lattes were not too sweet, they were perfect. The latte art were so cute! It's making me want to learn how to do them =)I can't wait to go back and try the rest on the menu!"", ""It's an alright spot if you're nearby. My dentist happens to be closeby. This spot is definitely over hyped now. You will come if you have a habit of IGing your coffee or cafe foods. That being said, the one in the Richmond is better.Things to note:-Nice place to work only if you don't mind the noise level. Between the music, espresso machine, patrons, and cafe worker's friends it can get loud even with headphones so bring your noise cancellers.-The specialty coffees are super high in calories and sugar. They don't serve nonfat or unsweetened almond milk. -Dont get the cookie monster. It tastes like a butter stick fell into your already-bland milk laden coffee.-Nothing special to say about the drip coffee. The roasts are a little watery so it's a bit bland but its the healthiest thing on thr menu probably.-If youre going to IG, get the birthday cake for the rainbow latte. If you care, request for a specific picture or youll get something normal like a heart.-My biggest disappointment: It's freezing in here. Bring a jacket or layer up if you plan on working in here. They won't close the door due to ADA reasons--which I understand and am all for the accommodations but I have never seen a shop or restaurant have a door that absolutely must be kept wide open 'due to ADA'. You can't just close the door and leave it a little ajar instead of freezing your patrons? With 50 degree weather i don't know any place in SF that leaves their doors wide open. Stop by if you're nearby or need a spot to work. But unless you're planning to take a selfie with your coffee, skip this spot as destination."", ""So cute and such a fun place to study or chat with friends! I ordered the birthday cake latte, and my friend ordered the red velvet latte. Both were incredible! I personally like my lattes on the sweeter side, so the birthday cake latte was perfect :) I had a sip of my friend's latte as well, and I loved it as well!Would definitely recommend coming, and would recommend both lattes!"", ""Drink wise, I thought the lavender latte was tasty. It had a light lavender flavor that paired well and didn't overpower the flavor of the latte. I also really liked their pesto chicken toast, but I was disappointed to find out when I came back for a second time that they took it off the menu."", 'Cute little coffee shop in the area. Trying to find a breakfast spot with no line or wait is difficult, especially on a weekend. HOME has fast friendly service. Their lines move pretty quick and since the food is simple, there is barely any wait. They have tables and bar style seating inside. Since many people like to come and hang out or do work on their laptops here, there are specific tables where it is strictly for eating/enjoying coffee AND tables that you can use your laptop at.......I like that concept. The menu is limited to coffee drinks, a few toasts, and pastries. Simple. Their drinks are tasty and most important.... pretty and instrgramable!', ""One of the reasons my friends and I stopped by here was because of the cool latte art. The menu is filled with various different lattes to choose from. I went for the hazelnut latte which was very good. They also have options if you're lactose intolerant. Did you know oat milk is a thing? Well I didn't till I came here and apparently when swapped with regular milk in lattes it's barely noticeable that it's not regular milk! The workers were super nice and very helpful about any questions I had. They also have types of toast if you want a little snack as well. I did not get the chance to try it but I definitely will the next time I am here.What's not to love about this cafe? From it's cute and simple decor you really can't go wrong. It's the perfect place to bring your laptop and get some work done while enjoying a latte. It is a bit small so it can fill up quickly so my suggestion is come a little early if you're planning on hanging out for a bit."", ""We tried out Home in the Outer Sunset, it was only 1 mile from the dumpling place but hubby didn't want to walk so we took Uber/Lyft - one of those car service.I ordered birthday cake latte $5.75 - it's very colorful artwork and has candy sprinkles on top. \xa0I liked it.Hubby got Cappuccino and it had a nice cappuccino art on it.Lots of folks in there. \xa0I can see it being very busy on weekends, glad we tried it on a weekday."", ""So disappointed. I trekked all the way out here to get a cool design on my latte only to receive a heart?! The cashier told me all the lattes came with the cool designs when I asked. I was furious when I picked it up from the counter and saw that heart. Also, they charge extra for milk substitutes-sorry I'm LACTOSE-INTOLERANT! Don't punish me by charging extra for it. They don't make their own syrups in house which also makes it not worth the high price tag. A place back home that I love makes their own syrups and their lattes are less than this. I had the coconut vanilla latte. It was good, but nothing special.I could've spent this $6.50 on dessert or better food. The positive is that Home is a conducive place to studying. They have a long line of tables and chairs set up and outlets. The first few tables have a no laptops sign, just a heads up."", ""Cute interior, can get very crowded and seating is difficult. This place is worth visiting if you're in the area and have never been.My lavender chai tasted watered down, I couldn't taste the lavender. I tried my friends' drinks and they were better - maybe it was just a bad order.I'll visit again with friends but if I'm just looking for a to-go order, I'd probably stop by Henry's a couple of blocks down instead."", 'Overly rated coffee and tea shop. Suppose to be ""laptop free"" on the weekends, yet this is not enforced so there\'s no where to sit and enjoy your pretty looking 12oz \xa0cup of coffee for $5.75. Must admit, the lady at the front counter was inviting, friendly and took the time to explain their menu and explained how the menu items with the stars are the favorites.', 'This is def a cute but quality coffee shop. Every time I come here, the workers are extremely nice and awesome. Most times, it\'s pretty packed and may be hard to get a table, but there are ""no laptop"" tables which are nice. Menu is very large so there\'s options for everyone!! Their specialty lattes (birthday cake, red velvet, rose, lavender, etc) are priced higher than regular but think they\'re so much fun and actually really good. Drinks are well made and very enjoyable to drink!! Other than their classic menu, they have other specialty menu items like affogatos and teas!! Food wise, they have toasts that are really good as well and offer third culture pastries ( a plus!!!!) they\'re so good!!Overall, love this place and come in when I can. It just gets really busy at times of day and I like to sit and enjoy my coffee!!', ""I've been here a couple of times and this place is so cute!! I always get the lavendar latte... seriously one of my favorite lattes ever! Love coming here on an early weekend morning, sipping coffee and people watch. I've had the avocodo toast here and it is delicious! This place is always \xa0packed with people studying. Really don't know how people can study in such a loud space. But the tables are usually occupied with students. Your best bet is to sit by the window or take your coffee to go."", ""I dragged my boyfriend here for the cute basic lattes. We came at noon on a holiday and it was packed. Like packed to where we were unable to get a table, and ended up consuming our drinks and food while standing. Not a big deal because we just used the little counter area by the door. For drinks, we ordered the Cookie Monster Latte and the Birthday Cake Latte. Although they were cute, they didn't taste any better than a typical latte from most other coffee shops. For noms, we ordered the Bravo and the Truffle Pesto Toasts. The bravo was your typical avocado toast with some bacon and radish. Compared to other avo toasts you can get in the city, this one failed to impress due to the lack of seasoning (not even pepper?) The truffle pesto toast served on a fluffy thick slice of bread with cherry tomatoes was much better, super yummy! Service was meh. The kitchen accidentally made us the kimchi toast instead of the Bravo Toast. Normally, we would just eat an incorrect order to avoid being annoying, but since neither of us likes kimchi, we asked to get our toast corrected. At first we were told we could keep the wrong toast since they were just going to throw it out, and then I was called over and told they actually want it back...interesting. They did give us the correct toast pretty speedily though. Overall, unless I'm trying to have something cute on my Instagram story I wouldn't come back."", ""Came here to do some work with a few friends.It's a bit noisy if you want to get work done without any headphones. The drinks are pretty good. The toasts are delicious. their latte art is on point. The place isn't too big and can get a bit crowded. Remember to ask for the WiFi password!"", ""I Love love loveHome!They have oatmilk! The servers are nice, the place is cute, the menu variety is great. I love that they encourage unplugging and talking. It's so crowded that every time I've gone I've sat with total strangers and always had a good time!Both locations are great!! I love birthday cake rainbow latte and condensed milk toast! Both are just soooooo good !!"", ""What a cute cafe with such beautiful and unique drinks! Seeing all the pictures on Yelp I had to go for the birthday cake latte (even though the cookie monster latte was a close second choice...next time!). The birthday cake latte doesn't actually taste like birthday cake and I believe has a vanilla and hazelnut base. It's not too sweet (granted I probably have a higher sweet tolerance) and is deliciously aromatic. Service can be a little slow since I'm sure the latte art takes awhile to create! You may also have to wait a bit for a table as the spot is pretty popular and can get crowded. Be prepared for lots of girls sitting nearby squealing over the drinks and getting pics for the 'gram =P. Kinda far away from where I live in North Beach so I don't think I'll be coming here on a regular basis, but definitely worth a visit if you're in the Sunset area!"", ""Came here to get some work done and overall, it was a pretty chill experience.Walking in around 10AM it was pretty busy already. Luckily I found a tight spot (in between 2 people) on the bar in front of the window. I ordered the Cookie Monster latte which was 'eh', nothing great. The cookies inside were a little stale, maybe from the heat of the coffee. And I ordered the toast with tomatoes, pesto, truffle, and mozzarella, adding a fried egg on top and it was pretty good! I got a few people asking me what I ordered because it looked so good. For the 2 items I paid around $16 which I found pretty overpriced but it's a SF cafe, what else could I expect?Knocking down 1 star because I wish they offered more outlets to charge your laptop, specifically at the bar. Also because I still found it to be a little overpriced as previously mentioned. But hey, this was all part of the SF cafe experience ultimately!"", ""I love home! Came here for the first time earlier this week on a Tuesday at 10am and there were plenty seats available to study/do work. The drink selections all sounded soooo good, but I opted for the Holy Cow which contains condensed milk. I'm not much of coffee/latte drinker because caffeine usually gives me a headache but the drink I had was perfect and didn't give me that after feeling I usually have with coffee.I also ordered a toast - the bacon, avocado and radish toast. I thought it was a bit expensive at $7, but it was healthy and filled me up, so it did the deed. Free WiFi here with outlets and plenty of seats. Friendly workers. 10/10 would recommend."", 'Cute little place. Very clean, modern, light, hipster.It\'s very much a quintessential San Francisco Cafe, which means it\'s pretty good.My Tomato oil truffle pesto toast was good. Classic toast really. I\'m not a huge fan of the super light and thick piece of toast, but it was still good. You know, $7 is ridiculous, but that\'s the going rate in the City, so it\'s not really a knock to them.My Lavender Latte was sweater than expected, but that\'s my bad for not asking I suppose. They coffee itself was good, but I was disappointed it didn\'t taste more like lavender. In the future I\'d try their plain coffee instead of getting ""creative.""

Food:- Cookie Monster Latte--$5.50The cookie butter did not overpower the coffee and instead added a pleasant sweetness to it. The latte was milky and smooth, and the little bits of melted cookie butter remains at the bottom of the cup were sweet and addicting. Little cookies on top of the latte were still a little crunchy, and even better when dunked in the latte.Tips:- We arrived around 4 pm on a Friday and there were a couple of seats available.

I've also tried their London Fog, Cookie Monster Latte, Jasmine Lavender Tea Latte, and Cold Brew. All are solid choices! My friend let me have a bite of one of their avocado toasts and it was delicious! What I love the most is their service! With each visit, the employees were super friendly and made me feel at home (haha). Seriously, they were very welcoming, helpful when it came to any questions, and very good at making conversation that didn't feel awkward at all. It was impressive how a short interaction like that while me ordering and paying was so impressionable!I love the ambience. The way the natural light hits during the day makes it bright.

You're extended a warm welcome the moment you step through their doors by staff behind the counter along with a, 'how's your day going?' We don't get those too much nowadays...it's certainly the little things that matter and create an environment that's personable and detail oriented - down to their beverages. I myself haven't had any of their fancier/unicorn decorated drinks but have had their more basic (beeyotch) coffee drinks (check my pics) which were definitely palate approved as I have been back a few times already.

There are no-laptop tables, and laptop/study tables, which I like, whether or not I am coming in to study or to hang out and grab coffee. I never see just a swamp of studiers camping out in there -- which can be annoying even for someone who does frequent cafes for that reason. My only complaint is that the toasts seem a bit too expensive (don't get me wrong, they are de-li-cious) and also the coffee here is bland/watery/weak. I grabbed both house-drip and pour over. I understand some people might get disappointed even at a good cup of pour over because they are mostly light/medium roasts, but this wasn't a flavorful light roast, it was more a bland coffee water. Stick to the espresso drinks or something creative, grab a toast, and it's still a very nice experience!"", 'Here to kill sometime after a long walk in the park.Ambiance and service are great.

I also appreciate the cute little cups and mugs when you order your drink to stay. I recently came for a quick breakfast pastry, but was pleasantly surprised by a pretty extensive breakfast menu. It was rough to choose btw all the fresh, healthy looking options, but I ended up going with the prosciutto and egg avo toast-- highly recommend!!

Not only that, I saw cleaning supplies left carelessly outside the bathroom which I thought was very sloppy. Though the furniture is nice and the food is okay, this major detail of bleach was so bad. My coffee tasted of bleach because of the smell. By the end of my time drinking coffee here, my eyes were burning. I wish I were not exaggerating because I really wanted to like this place in the Castro, but I think the management needs to rethink the way they do hygiene at the coffee shop.

Literally every table inside was occupied by one person on a computer or a phone, all in a line facing the counter. It felt like a satire.That being said, the area in the front seems better for gathering with a friend and feels a bit organic. My latte was solid, though there seemed to be something missing from my friend's dirty chai, maybe a little less chai than expected, as it was missing some of the earthy and spiciness we usually associate with dirty chais.

I also had one of their very smooth and strong cups of coffee.Let me just say that the Shakshuka and coffee did not go together like two peas in a pod. Next time, I\'d probably opt for the more traditional breakfast sandwich (which looks delicious from the pictures), but I did enjoy all the flavors of the Shakshuka; it was great to try it once, but it just felt weird eating something like that for breakfast with a hot cup of coffee.

Neighbor’s Corner,"[""This charming cafe served up much more than an amazing matcha latte and delectable piece of avocado burrata toast on the morning we visited.

We were lucky to find the last couple of seats in this super cozy spot, and by the time our food was ready a line had formed out the door.The avocado and burrata toast was absolutely delicious! My eyes must have grown to the size of golf balls when I first laid them on it. Fresh is best and fresh it was, the handful of arugula with the creamy burrata on the very thick toast had me savoring every bite.There were so many other great looking and smelling brunch items, coffees and pastries I gazed at as they passed over the counter.

I am a huge fan of Andytown and their Snowy Plover so knowing that I didn't need to drive all the way to the Outer Sunset to get my caffeine fix was an amazing realization.The cafe is located in the residential area in Castro/Noe...you know the part where you have to climb the giant hill to get there and you wonder if your engine will actually make the crest at the top of the hill. What's nice about that is that there isn't as much foot traffic so it has a much quieter, chiller vibe. On a Saturday afternoon, there were actually some available tables--a crazy thought in San Francisco!They offer a variety of coffee options, including the famous Snowy Plover, and also some cool matcha options. The Snowy Plover mixes espresso, sparkling water, brown sugar syrup, and a generous dollop of salted homemade whipped cream. The result is perfectly balanced and refreshing coffee float. It's not overly sweetened like a lot of other coffee drinks so if you're a true coffee lover, don't worry it won't overpower the espresso itself. They also have several food options including Andytown's delicious scones (served with fennel honey whipped butter!) and also some more cafe-like options like avocado toast, etc. It also seems to double as a mini-market as there was a generous refrigerated section and also various goods being sold in a cute bookshelf (random items from Haribo gummy bears to handcrafted pottery--the theme was very unclear to me).My one qualm: wish they opened until 5 or 6 PM...although, they did recently extend their hours to 4 PM daily."", ""A wonderful local cafe. \xa0Coffee is great, service is friendly, and it is really nice to be a bit off of 24th Street. \xa0I'm always able to get a space to sit and they welcome people working there. \xa0Prices are high, but alas, we live in San Francisco."", ""The atmosphere is incredibly pleasant, and it's one of the cutest coffee shops I've ever been to.

In addition to the usual espresso drinks and teas, they also have an assortment of matcha specials. Since it was particularly hot the day we visited, mom and I both got iced drinks (even though we have a rule about not drinking anything iced before 12PM). I got the matcha with tonic - which was good until all the ice melted and it turned into soupy green gunk.

Bathroom was clean and had cool decor. This shop also carries bottled drinks like kombucha, ice cream, and healthy food/snacks.

I went in for coffee and a croissant again. Steven asked me how I was... and while I love a social contract... I didn\'t have it in me. ""I\'m pretty shitty actually...."" was my response. He cracked a pun or two about my star-covered dress and he was very sweet. When the latte was done I gave him my card. He pushed it back gently and said ""it\'s on me...

The egg was hardboiled, which is unusual but not bad. The scones with the seasoned butter are fantastic and definitely worth trying. To be honest, I was sad that I didn't have time to try all of the baked goods because they all looked amazing.There's also a refrigerator with various prepared food from recognisable SF restaurants, as well as some jams, coffee beans, etc. for sale.The service here deserves a special callout.

It was honestly so cool seeing the barista whip out a machine and torch my drink. And it was even more fun trying to break the top of my drink. Her whopper latte was good and I really enjoyed the sweetness. Mind you, I was surprised they actually dropped a few whopper candies in the drink. It was pretty cool.The food was delicious. I'm a fiend for anything PBJ and the jam tasted so fresh. I was debating about also getting the avocado toast but they added red flakes.. and anything red reminds me of spicy.

I was lucky to get a seat where I could tuck away my suitcase and ordered the Black Sesame (!!) latte and the frittata sandwich. If I'm spending $$ on getting food I'd rather do it locally on the good stuff than the airport. I love all things black sesame and this didn't disappoint, it had that black sesame derived savoriness (?) that I only have a word for in Korean (gosohae). There was a ton of it ground up and in the latte but it does settle so make sure to stir it up! The sandwich was really good, level of cooked/toasted was perfect. The chips were OK, tasted like ruffles or something.It was the perfect setting for a casual, leisurely but also get s**t done environment with great food and coffee, would highly recommend and will stop by again in the future."", ""Live reviews are the best.Rise and Grind is indeed appropriately named. Saturday afternoon close to Christmas and there are still young professional cats with their noise cancelling headphones going ham on their company laptops. Corporate culture all about that Grind.Which is a shame because this place got something like 67 different types of lattes on their menu. I guess the Salted Caramel and the Vanilla ones are a given in San Francisco at this point, but these guys also have a Creme Brûlée Latte, a Whopper Latte (candy, not the burger i assume), and some 'exclusive' ones like the Biscoff Cookie Latte. Wild. Imagine coming here not grinding and enjoying some of these sweet creations with bae or something.But my bae is at the dentist next door and i'm out here drinking The Richmond Chill. It's their take on the traditional vietnamese iced coffee. Two espresso shots with condensed milk, served chill with the milk of my choice. It's hovering on the sweet side and definitely a bit creamy. My dentist would not approve.It's uncomfortably quiet in here. They got some soft David Archiletta playing in here, mixed in with the casual chatter from the two Baristas. Basically a perfect place for studying. I see a few outlets here and there for your laptop. There's also those bar/bench seating by the window if you decide to bring your ipad. Whenever i see an ipad outside of home i always think of that 'what's a computer?' commercial.The two baristas are very nice. They're like librarians when they walk the avocado toasts to your table. Super quiet and with minimum disturbance. They know their crowd.I feel a bit it of place with my casual demeanor and my Saturday vibes. I wouldn't choose this place to catch up with a friend or to reread The Prisoner of Azkaban. It'll be perfect if i had weekend work or if i had a side hustle in life to tend to. Perhaps that's what i need. I'm growing older at a scary and an alarming rate and my bank account is not keeping pace. Maybe it's about time i stop using Saturday's to rise and shine and instead using them to Rise and Grind.But until that moment i guess i'll SYOY!"", ""What a cute find! I was looking for somewhere to study in the area to catch up on some work before a picnic in the park. It's pretty small but there's a lot of light and spacious tables.As the biggest PB fan, I was eager to try the peanut butter latte. It's mostly PB rather than coffee, so something of a dessert. I think it was kinda overwhelming but worth trying! Onto other great things about this place! I could always find a table although there's a university in the area. There are also outlets and good WiFi (huge win!). Plus, a bathroom for the customers. I've needed up coming to Rise & Grind a couple more times to do work. Would recommend to everyone!"", ""A lovely place with lovely people who make great beverages.

They do have lots of variety after all (including a beloved avocado toast)."", 'Came here for the first time yesterday and fell in love with it!

There are a couple spots for electric outlets, which is a plus! Bathroom: Get a code from the cashier. It's clean! Staff: Super nice and friendly. The orders were made pretty quickly as well. Avocado toast: The best one I've ever had. The avocado is mushed, well seasoned, and nicely spread. The toast was crunchy on the sides and soft on the inside.

For cafes, I like to prioritize it being a good work/study environment with eats/drinks being secondary.Foremost, good wifi and multiple outlets to either get some work done or watch videos. What I personally like about this place is the flow of people throughout the day; the cafe might have only you in it, but a few hours in, and there's a pleasant hum of people talking. They have both eats and drinks that include coffee and tea, or pastries and meals. Coffee and tea are good with prices reasonable. You'll occasionally hear people order the avocado toast, but never having tried it myself, it's next on my to-do list. Lastly, there is free street parking! Feels like a rare thing in San Francisco, but beware of street cleaning day which is the 1st and 3rd Monday of the month. An understated, but appreciated fact, is that it's located right next to Golden Gate Parking making it an ideal date spot before or after a little stroll in the park.

The milk supports the Early Grey tea very well, the tea still comes through strong. Avocado Toast - Runny, fried egg sits atop of a bed of mashed avocado smeared across a comfy, thick piece of toast. Garnished with red pepper flakes. Yum! Salted Caramel Latte - A solid caramel latte. The latte art was definitely a plus!Matcha Waffles - MMmmatcha! Comes in 4 pieces, toasted and drizzled over by a matcha/condensed milk syrup. The edges were a little overdone but I loved this nonetheless!

The Mill,"['Pizza is served after 6!!!!!!!!!For those who traveled 300 plus miles like me to try their pizza, GO AFTER 6 pm!!!Now after trying the coffee. I was sold. It was great, smooth and not so acidic! Enough power to get you through your next hurdle! I cant stress enough about not being able to try the pizza. I get it. Its made at a certain time so thats when you get it. I should have done my research a little more in depth vs ""awe yeah good pizza!"" total FAIL.Bread on the other hand is great. I cant remember the list of names they had but thats nicely baked, almost burnt. We picked up some cheese and made sure this bread is treated with upmost respect! Dang it was good.I love a good dark rye, sourdough, anything thats baked with love.Lots of seating, high ceiling, white walls, proper greetings. Its all melodious. Toasts with different jams and hummus, maybe some feta, even avocado. I only glanced at the toasts for a second. They serve it all for each distinguished palates from what I saw.

It's no surprise it was rated on SF's most Instagram worthy spots. But.If you are like me, you eat with your mouth as much as your eyes. The coffee falls flat and the toast has been pretty disappointing. Adding giant pieces of rock salt to a peanut butter and jelly toast doesn't elevate it. Avocado toast was ok. They also will not slice the bread for you. So, I prefer walking down to Bi-Rite for a loaf."", ""My friend recommended me to stop by here as it was one of her favorite coffee shops. The interior resembles being inside of a working Mill (I've never been in a mill but I've seen a lot of movies. ha!) The place was very vibrant, with many people just working, socializing and simply reading. The Mill has a very open environment and feel, where it does make it seem like you're in bakery factory. I ordered the macchiato as I wanted to try something different than a latte. The macchiato was super dark and had a strong roast aroma. I can see why some people might not like this, but I really enjoyed sipping on this. Parking here kind of sucks as you're in the heart of NOPA. I would strongly suggest Uber or public transportation."", ""Dang I can't stop thinking about their molasses brown bread. So chewy, so tender, slightly dense but moist -- I could sink into this everyday. It was THE BEST TOAST I've ever had. This means a lot coming from a girl who wrote stories about a talking toast named EatMe in middle school. Now I just write yelp reviews ft real toast. Anywhoo--Almond butter + molasses brown bread (!!)= simple, pure, perfection. The brown bread goes real well with the nutty almond butter. Their original pairing was with everything bread, but I'm so glad I got to try the brown bread. Thank you The Mill for being cool and flexible.Cream cheese + pesto + rye = combination flavor heaven. They are all a good match. The pesto has a strong flavor in the best way while the sea salt brings it out and the cream cheese mellows it. And the bread. Easily the best rye I've had. Not dense or dry, but chewy. The menu is simple but innovative with great combinations. Latte was great too. Food came out fast. And quite reasonable, no $12 avocado toast nonsense. Also this place is bright with a nicely designed interior. The neighborhood is walkable and nice and we found parking easy friday morning. And the brown bread(!!) my gosh."", ""I finally tried the Mill's pizza today!!...after two years of hearing my good friend talk so highly about it.

ALso SOO good, fresh, and not pretentious.We came on a Sunday right at 6pm and there was already a line! About 10 minutes later we got to order. I got two slices and I'm SOO glad I did.

Forget avocados and forget cream cheese, throw anything on top of this bread and it will be AMAZING! Arrived at 10:40am and the line was out the door and no seats were available.

Even though there's quite a few people with their laptops out, this place does not have wifi or outlets which is a shame cause I would be happy to just sit and eat toast while I work all day. It has a nice open layout and lots of natural light. Location is a bit far from BART so not the most convenient to get to. Parking is mostly street and can get busy. Service here is so friendly and welcoming.I got the #1 which was dark mountain rye bread from Josey Bakery with a smear of cream cheese, pesto, pine nuts, salt, and pepper. The bread quality is excellent. A thick hefty piece with a hearty nutty texture and a bit of sourness from the rye. Nice tang from the cream cheese and a very earthy herby pesto. Generous amount of pepper and salt brings out all the favors. Really wish the pine nuts were toasted. Is it worth $7 though? Not really. I'd rather go to Josey Bakery for a loaf and make this myself.Overall, The Mill is a great place to do some quick work. The service is friendly and the quality of the items they serve is good but honestly a bit overpriced especially when I can't stay around to do work."", ""This place is PACKED on the weekends up until around 5:30pm when people start heading back for dinner plans. Around 6:30pm, there's a new influx of people coming for the 6-9pm pizza ($3/slice). That said, the best time to come to snag indoor seating is between 5:30-6:15pm.

Would come back for the vibeszz"", ""Ugh, I ordered the dark mountain rye with cream cheese, pesto, salt, pepper, and pine nuts for $7. I didn't know what it would look like, but I was hoping it would be the nice, thick toast that everyone else seemed to be eating. It wasn't. It was a pretty thin slice - probably because it's rye bread. I probably should have went with a different combo and I probably should not be spending $7 for a tiny piece of toast with cream cheese.We also got a few pastries from the display. They seemed kinda meh, kinda familiar. When I asked if they made it or if it was shipped in, I believe the cashier told me it was from Neighbor Bakehouse. Ah I see. They rejected my request to heat up the $5 pastries lol. Good place to experience an overwhelming feeling of SF arrogance from the staff and customers.

Loved it the moment I walked in. The smell of fresh baked bread gets you hungrier. They have variety of breads for sale and also delicious toasts with different toppings. Few baked goods such as danishes and croissants and a great \xa0coffee bar. The cappuccino was delicious. We ordered few toasts just to try it out, all delicious. We bought zaatar bread to go and a jar of raspberry jam. Both were amazing. The bread lasted few days and stayed very fresh. Overall great quality baked goods guaranteed.Try it.', ""Came to this hipster spot at the suggestion of a friend who lives in the neighborhood. Can a cafe that sells different kinds of toasts be anything but trendy AF?

I went ham and got two toasts: pesto and almond butter. The pesto was the besto.

Did I say I like pizza? I find it to be the perfect snack - carbs, proteins, vitamins.So whenever Arizmendi in the Mission has a day off (Tuesdays) or they have unnatural toppings (I am looking at you comice pears or potato or something ungodly that you simply do not put on pizza without giving an Italiano grandmother a mini heart attack), I head over to The Mill.This is a hipster place that plays hipster music and is frequented by hipsters who like hipster beer and hipster food at hipster prices. To be fair, the food, craft beer, coffee and bread (Josey Baker bread) are great.Every evening from 6-9 (except first Monday of every month) they serve you pizza by the slice. One seasonal veggie and another classic cheese slice. It's a pretty big slice for $3.50 (plus taxes) and you can tell it has high quality ingredients. The magic is in the dough, which is baked perfectly, light, airy, crisp and salty (think tiny chunks of salt that hit your palette as you bite the crust). I usually get it to go, and I reheat it at 450 until the cheese starts to boil a wee bit. And voila, it's ready to be gone in 60 seconds. If you are craving a slice, without breaking the bank or your daily calorie budget, this is the place to be in the evening. You can usually find a spot on weekday evenings, and get your slice within 3 minutes.The toppings can be from onion and mushroom to 4 cheese (quattro formaggi) to something ungodly such as pineapple and jalapeño (sounds better than it tastes). Try this pizza for the dough. Also it's not gooey or overflowing with oil. So you won't feel tres guilty. If you want to balance it out, they also have a salad (7 bucks I think) that can make you justify that delicious slice."", ""Came here on a Sunday morning with a friend, and there was a line in the store. However, we were able to find a seat. I got the fruit jam toast and he got the nutella. The toast itself was a pretty good size and reasonably thick. The toppings were fine, albeit a bit plain for the price. There also was sea salt added to both of ours, which is nice in theory, but they might have overdone it as it was a bit too salty and actually hurt my mouth to eat it. I would give this place a 3.5 if I could. Coffee was average. The loaves of bread for sale looked good, and I heard the pizza is amazing. I would come back for the more savory toasts or the pizza, but I'm not in a rush to come back for the sweets toasts."", ""The bread, coffee and pizza at the mill are great, and the service friendly, but the prices are a bit high. I usually buy a loaf of the bread on the weekends to have on hand during the week.I used to buy it at bi rite next door while picking up other groceries but ecently it hasn't been available there so I have to come to the mill which I don't love because you have to wait 10 minutes to buy a loaf of bread, which is frustrating when not ordering a drink or toast etc. I wish there was a way for neighborhood folks to quickly buy a loaf of bread."", ""When I first moved to sf I would go to The Mill all the time for toast in the morning, but eventually I got tired of waiting in line. BUT for the past year \xa0 I have been getting a whole veggie pie to go and it is SOOO good! There were a couple of times last month that the dough seemed a little thin but still delish. My favorite so far have been the delicata squash with pesto and the brussels sprouts but sadly I only got to have each once, unlike many others that they rotate more often.

It's almost setup like Four Barrel Coffee on Valencia the way things are arranged. They brew Four Barrel as well.

Andytown Coffee Roasters,"[""Personally, I am a huge fan of coffee. Andytown offers a unique twist to their drinks. There's something about espresso and Pellegrino that's soooo right! They make their own whipped cream. My favorite is their snowy plover (they may have renamed it). It's basically espresso with Pellegrino topped off with their homemade whipped cream. make sure you mix it all up before drinking. Probably my favorite caffeinated drink ever. It's great that Andytown is so eco friendly. Their cups are compostable and they only use paper straws. Of course, you can take it to the next level and purchase one of their reusable metal straws for less than the price of a cup of coffee. The metal straw also comes with a little brush for cleaning the inside. If you like coffee, definitely checkout Andytown."", ""DON'T get the breakfast sandwich.

I was searching through yelp for a good coffee spot in the area and came accross Andytown. I love coffee and anything with caffeine so I had to try their unique drink. I got here around 945am on a Saturday and there was line out the door already. I had my eye on the original snowy plover already, by reading reviews on it. The drink was definitely different....they make it with espresso, soda water, and a scoop of their home made cream. I loved it! It could be a little bit stonger in my opinion. I also got the blood orange scone which was tasty. They have a limited seating area inside and a few tables outside.

It is so addicting!!

Sometimes the other two locations on Taravel don't even fill me with a full cup.

All the negative reviews mainly mention that. While I do agree that this shop is rather cramped, I will not allow it to be to its detriment. Nope, not on my account. My advice, take a good shop for what it is.I had a memorable experience at Andytown and that was largely due in part to the friendliness of the staff. Their welcome was warm and surely came with smiles. What a good way to have woken up that morning. Aside from an excellent cup of drip I enjoyed, the breakfast sandwich that I accompanied it with made my morning start even better. Despite its shortcomings in size, I feel that is what made the experience. It means having to sit closely by complete strangers, elbows likely touching, or being on the lookout for the next open space if you haven't found a place yet. It has a charm to it, maybe an inconvenient one if that paradox is acceptable. It's good for a short stop, so take it at that. I was smitten with my visit to Andytown. So much so that I referred to it as my favorite coffee stop during my weekend in San Fran when talking to friends.

Anyways, I came with a group of 12 people and we literally took half the chairs in the outside seating area. My fiance got the iced coffee which was REALLY strong. I think I could\'ve added a full cup of water and it could still be strong. They also have paper straws (bring your own straws) for the cold drinks, which ended up getting soggy after like 5 minutes of drinking your coffee. It\'s in a quiet neighborhood (At least it was on Sunday around 2pm) so there was lots of parking available.', ""I got the Snowy Plover, which is what everyone seems to rave about for this place and what was the Instagram shot for the day. Unfortunately, while it looked pretty, I thought it was disgusting!You're basically drinking an espresso soda, with sweetener in it, and some whip cream on top. The whole thing was disgusting, and tasted really off, especially the sweetener that comes with the espresso soda. It was just an unusual and unpleasant sensation.The best part of the drink though was the whipped cream, that was amazing and tasted really good. If I could do it over I'd just ask for an espresso shot with the whipped cream, and I would have loved it a lot.Even when mixing the whipped cream in, it only made the drink marginally better, and it wasn't enough to carry the otherwise crappy drink."", ""Matcha lattes here are bomb! They're always busy so if you're in a rush come earlier. I only tried their snowy plover once and it wasn't what I expected in a good way. Think super fizzy coffee with addicting whip cream lol. Pastries are also good but they change everyday.Service is always friendly and drinks come out fast. No wonder they're always so busy! ;)"", 'Absolutely fantastic find and I am definitely coming back whenever able! Space was welcoming, well light with sunny windows, definitely a community vibe with regulars coming in, chatting it up. Latte was amazing, homie mugs to stay. Mini chocolate muffin, gluten free-- tasty and light but not the best texture (bread crumbles)Coffee w dollop of home made cream. OMG. This cream. To die for. Last and most important--staff was fantastic, welcoming, kind, knowledgeable, cool.', ""It's always cold in the Sunset, but never too cold for Snowy Plovers!! I also don't usually start off my day with iced coffee (I have this unspoken rule about not drinking anything cold before noon..), but I was happy to make an exception today! :)I've always been a fan of espresso with tonic, so this drink was definitely on my radar, and I'm so glad I tried it. The little bit of brown sugar syrup was just sweet enough to cut the bitterness of the espresso but not so much that I couldn't enjoy the strong aroma of the Andytown roast. The homemade whipped cream was also really, really good! I'm not even usually a fan of whipped cream, and typically order my drinks without it, but I loved the texture of theirs! I think I will be requesting it in all of my future drinks, even if it isn't included. :9I had the cheddar bacon scone for breakfast, which was quite tasty, but pricey for what it was. I think the next time I visit, it will just be for the coffee. I'm excited to bring my coffee-loving friends here though!In terms of the cafe itself, it is pretty tiny with one larger communal table and a few counter seats. I'm not sure if they have outdoor seating year round, but they did today, which is where I sat to enjoy my breakfast. Otherwise, this cafe is probably better as a grab-to-go type of place than somewhere to sit and do work."", ""Oh no, they stop serving bread at 3pm! Despite this and the fact that the shop is tiny with little seating, the coffee wins me over.I got a latte with almond milk. It was the best latte I've ever had. Such a rich, nutty flavor.Boyfriend got the snowy blower and was moderately happy. I think because it was a cold, rainy day the latte was especially delicious. I could see the snowy blower being especially delicious during summer.The other pastries didn't seem appealing to me so I was pretty bummed that they stopped serving bread. Hopefully next time I'll get to try it!Like I mentioned approx less than 15 seats inside, about 10 outside, my estimates are generous. Bathroom looked really clean."", ""What they're famous for: The Snowy Plover. It is quite good. Espresso+Sparkling Water+Homemade Whip Cream=WAHBAHM SHAZAM BOOM BAAM SHATTER CRASH WOW!I could imagine it being ideal on a hot day. The place itself gets pretty crowded. I had to squeeze next to a neighbor (leave room for Jesus). Their wi-fi is pretty solid.Note: There's a lot of free parking around since Andy's is located in the middle of a residential area."", ""Mind blown from the snowy plover. Also tried my friend's matcha plover and loved that as well. This place is lit!Kudos to Andytown for differentiating themselves in the sea of coffee shops in the world by creating this clever and memorable drink. Just sad they don't have any shops in my hometown."", ""This hip little coffee shop in the outer sunset is exactly what you'd think it would be: cool, clean and nicely hipster. They boast a small menu of breakfast pastries, toast and sandwiches but, the coffee is the star. The cold brew was punchy and delicious. Served in a pint glass with ice was a great way to be able and experience all it's aromas. The toast I ordered beside it was reminiscent of Irish soda bread as it was dense and slightly crumbly. The butter was also quite good but, it lacked salt. Drop some salt crystals on that butter and you've got a winner. It's a great place to work as the outside seating is anything but distracting and the neighborhood people watching is legit. I love it out there..."", ""Was slightly underwhelmed by this place. It's got a lovely neighborhood feel but it's not great for getting work done or relaxing with a book unless you sit outside in your space. It gets super crowded and it's a small shop so it's not the easiest to move around. That said, $3.25 for a small drip is a bit steep, though the $1 refills are a nice option. The drip itself is solid, very smooth when it cools down, but didn't blow me away. The chocolate chips though are pretty dope, and they're perfect snack size.""]","['5.0 star rating', '1.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '1.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '2.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '4.5 star rating']"
Snowbird Coffee,"['Incredible staff with a refined menu. The staff are fun and engaging, and always greet me with a smile -- This coffee shop is officially my favorite to work at. And not to mention the awesome playlists!', ""Cute little coffee shop I visited while being a tourist in NorCal. We were craving something warm on a rainy day and ordered a lavender tea. I'd never come across a tea like this where the pouch was long and skinny as opposed to regular tea bags. The tea was very, very fragrant. I personally wouldn't get it again because I prefer black flavored tea as opposed to what this was, which had essentially close to no color. The ambiance was nice, but congested. I liked the cute little figurines at the cashier's desk."", 'When you hang out on Yelp too much, you find Snowbird Coffee on Yelp because it\'s a newer, fun coffee shop and people try it and leave it on Yelp. I have not written a review in like 6 days, but not a complete week. As you know, I tried to write more TripAdvisor reviews. Yelp is for coffee shops like Snowbird! So here, Snowbird, I have a review for you...Snowbird has a basic cafe list, and I looked for a unique drink. I found the Cafe ""Bombon."" I asked the cashier what the Bombon is and he said it\'s ""2 shots of espresso over condensed milk."" Alright, so I decided to try it. And then I got it eventually after waiting in a busy line. Then, it was handed to me in a small, cardboard espresso cup(well, I wanted it to-go)...and it looked like chocolate milk or mocha. And then I had the Bombon. I had to sip it and then I judged it. It was a mocha-like espresso and I did not feel the texture of condensed milk, but it was a little sweeter I\'d say. Hmm...trying very interesting coffee drinks is fun...and a total waste of cash...but it makes my reviews more interesting on Yelp..so here\'s to the ""Bombon"" at Snowbird!Snowbird has some apparel on sale, and you can hang out at the cafe. It\'s near 9th and Judah...I got a bagel after and then I found myself at the bookstore(Green Apple)...and this is what you can do at 9th and Irving..and then you can take the N Judah home...Have a nice day!', 'I think I might have just found my new coffee spot. I ordered an iced brevano... this drink is perfect, exactly what I imagined. I wish it was more than 6 oz bc I tried drinking it slow but sucked it down so fast. Perfect blend of creamy and sweet. I will be back', ""Each time I run through the Sunset, I make a stop to this awesome location. It was a lucky find through Yelp, and I haven't looked back since my first trip.AMBIANCE gives a hipster vibe, without the disgruntled staff. Quite the opposite, each time I come in I'm greeted by a friendly team member who seems excited to help me figure out what I want. The space is quite large, with space to sit outside, in the front of the cafe, or in the back which provides a nice scene for working.ORDERED Matcha latte with oat milk ($4.75 + $.75 for oat milk = $5.50).DRINK is fantastic each time! This is one of the first spots I tried switching out regular milk with oat milk, and the balance is perfect (and doesn't overwhelm the matcha).OVERALL I give this spot a fit four stars. Definitely recommend coming in and giving their popular drinks a go as well."", ""Solid neighborhood hang; my go-to in this part of the Sunset. The drinks are all good, if not spectacular. I usually go for the Spainiard, a sweet latte made with condensed milk. It's a bit small and it can be hard to find a place to sit during peak hours. The vibe is on the quieter side, with most patrons hammering away on laptop keyboards or pensively hovering over books. Not a lot of power outlets. I will be back whenever I'm in the area and need to get work done, provided my battery has a full charge."", ""I'm not often in the Inner Sunset these days, but when I stop by, Snowbird Coffee is now one of my favorite places to visit. This is a charming coffee shop on 9th Avenue, and the wooden furniture and soft lighting makes this a perfect place if you are looking for a workspace or just a cafe to meet up with a friend to chat for a while. I've tried several of their espresso-based drinks and have not been disappointed. Their Americanos are great, but if you have a sweet tooth, they have a few drinks that include condensed milk as one of the ingredients. I've tried their café bombón, which takes a base of condensed milk and adds a double shot of espresso. The bitterness of the espresso balances the milk well, and it makes me nostalgic for those old days studying abroad in Spain (where I'd get a café biberon at the local cafes). Seating is limited, but I've never had a problem finding a table for myself. You should give this place a try!"", ""I have frequented Snowbird more than a handful of times and I am now writing a review because they have OATLY oat milk. After going to other coffee shops, this brand of oat milk is hard to come by! It's so creamy and delicious. Yum!"", ""Was in the area so I decided to try out this cute little coffee shop. Upon walking in, I was greeted by the cashier who explained the menu to us and told us which drinks were most popular. I went with her recommendation of the Spaniard, a Spanish latte with condensed milk. I really enjoyed this drink and found that it had a good amount of sweetness - it was the perfect accompaniment to a little work session. The space is pretty small with single tables as well as a mini bar area so I wouldn't really recommend it for large groups unless you're getting your drinks to go but I will say that there's adequate room to get your work done if you're just planning on using your laptop! It is a bit dim in the back though so it's not the best work space in that sense. Overall my drink was tasty, the price was reasonable and competitive with others, and service was very friendly! I'll definitely be back again to try some of the other specialty drinks."", ""Snowbird is a chill, casual multi-roaster coffee spot that offers plenty of seating room and decent coffee and baked goods. I swing by on a rainy day and got the Spaniard, which is a Spanish latte meaning it has condensed milk that makes it a little sweeter than your average latte. Sure was tasty, but wish it we're a few degrees hotter than served. Pretty cool spot to hang out at as there's seats in the front and back."", 'This is a nice little coffee shop that we can walk to when we visit SF.

Most workers here treat their coffee better than their customers. Sightglass, never forget who\'s serving whom.I enjoy Sightglass coffee, but had an extremely disappointing experience yesterday when I used the Ritual app for the first time to pick up an order. I wasn\'t warned that your shop was not pet-friendly, so I walked my dog there and thought I could pop in to quickly grab my order. Upon seeing the no pets sign, I asked your barista if someone could grab my order upstairs since no pets are allowed inside. Instead of giving a direct answer, he told me to speak with your production team. A young woman in production said no dogs allowed, but she could grab my order. She asked for my name and what service I ordered through. When she found out it was for Ritual, she said I had to pick it up myself and told me to tie my dog outside. In SF, when anything left on the sidewalk is fair game, I wasn\'t about to risk losing my dog for coffee. So I asked her again if she could allow a one time courtesy since I wasn\'t notified about the no pet policy. She rudely said, ""No we\'re busy working"".1. When it comes to working, wouldn\'t you say that serving customers would be your team\'s highest priority? And if her task was too urgent/important, couldn\'t she have politely phrased her response? 2. I asked her to simply grab my order upstairs, but she treated me like I was a homeless person begging in some fancy establishment. No coffee, no matter how delicious, is worth risking my dog over or being treated so poorly. It\'s JUST COFFEE. I demand compensation and an apology for such a terrible experience. Your staff needs to be retrained, told to get over themselves and cool it with the snooty vibe. They are there to serve the people who help pay their salary. Don\'t forget who\'s serving whom.1 star because the coffee is good.', ""Hmm.. I love the shop layout here. When we arrived here, the line wasn't too long but can see the shop was pretty busy.

You can tell that this is where they also have their roasting facility and corporate offices.I ordered a mocha for here which only comes in one size and appeared to be either 8 or 10 ozs. Since I haven't been in awhile, I confirmed that the chocolate used in their mocha is vegan. Almond milk is the only dairy milk alternative that they offer, so I had my mocha made with almond milk. My drink was good, but tasted a bit bitter and I suspect that it would have tasted more balanced had they added more chocolate. I still enjoyed it though even though I prefer a less bitter flavor. I would definitely come back to this location if I was in the area and looking for coffee."", ""Thank you yelp for getting me to visit Sightglass coffee. I'm a sucker for good coffee and this was a match made in heaven. This place doesn't look like anything from the outside but then you come in and it's this two stories industrial room with the coffee bar in the middle. We had two cappuccinos and a macchiato. The coffee it self was really good but the latte art was just beautiful with no bubbles in the milk (that's how you know they're really good). We sat on the second floor so that we could get an overview of the room. Super cool. They also played really good music."", ""I want to live in Sight Glass! I love the interior of this place!!! Literally my dream home. The open space is very inviting and I love how it looks when they open the huge window.I've been here 3x now, and I am hooked. My boyfriend is quite the coffee connoisseur, so he recommended I check it out since it's only a 2 minute walk from work. Service is good. I feel like a lot of people are unimpressed with the service because they're not chipper and grinning from ear to ear, but they work hard. And they let the quality of their work speak. Have you ever worked as a barista? I have. And it's not a very glamorous or fun job, so I respect the people at that place. I think they do a good job, and they've always been very courteous to me. Their pastries pair so well with their coffee. My drink choice is either an Americano or a plain latte. The espresso is so delicious, you don't need all that sweetener. I don't drink enough coffee to be a coffee snob, but I am very picky. Because of my boyfriend, I've been exposed to some good coffee, and I don't drink it if it isn't good. You can really taste the difference here. Also love their latte art!It's pretty expensive, so I'll only come if I want to treat myself. HA! yea right, take my money, please."", ""I'm not really a cool guy. I don't try to be. If I did, I would only succeed at making myself increasingly less cool, with the added embarrassment that comes about with effort. That said, it's with painful self awareness that I carry myself everyday about my business. Sadly, there is no way for the employees at Sightglass to know that, as they seemed determined to make it apparent that I wasn't cool enough to be there through their aloof manner of conducting their business. Oh, they're cool all right, this lot! And they make a mean espresso. Unfortunately, it ends up being a largely bitter experience.To review the coffee alone, it's comfortably a 4*+. Strong, smooth, perfect temperature on the latte. I wasn't thrilled that they don't have skim milk, but I'm over that. Sizes are small for a $5 latte, but it's SF, and as I mentioned previously, you're paying a bit to be reminded that you're only barely cool enough to order this coffee, and nowhere near cool enough to think that that entitles you to sticking around to enjoy this gigantic space.Service was... acceptable? It isn't outwardly rude, but it's definitely detached, and the whole place just feels stuffy and smug. It's the feeling of SoMa. We ride the highs, so we're forced to accept the lows along with them. Maybe this is balance?This joint is without WiFi, but as I mentioned before, the space is huge. If you're coming with a coworker or to catch up on a new book, you won't even notice. But if you're like me and your life is in your laptop, it's fairly inconvenient. Just something to be aware of.The lattes here really are exceptional. But the added cost is just too high for me to realistically come back."", ""Came here on a early Saturday afternoon and it was pretty poppin'! I love the shop itself. Really welcoming, plenty of places to sit, BUT a little dark - that could also just be Karl's fault though. This was my first Sightglass visit. I was hoping to get a pastry in addition to a drink but danngg! Pastries are a little out of budget here... I ordered a Vanilla Iced Cold brew which came out The Flash fast! I dumped my copious amounts of creamer into it and it was really good! Me and my friends hung out in the upstairs area which was a really cool floor! There's plenty of seating up there and a little more light than the downstairs area. As for their restrooms... y'all the soap smells SO GOOD! I'm not sure what it was specifically I think lavender but it smelled so good that I even looked around to see if they were selling it in store, they weren't :( but I believe it was a local soap company which is awesome!"", 'This is a nice space to get a good coffee and catch up with a friend. However, I was planning to drive into SF from the East Bay, needing a place to get some work done. I saw ""Free Wifi"" marked on their page, so I drove there and ordered a coffee. When I asked for the wifi information, they told me they don\'t actually have wifi or outlets. Hopefully someone can update this info on Yelp to be accurate.', ""Very cute coffee shop I found while I was visiting SF on a business trip. I found via Yelp as I was staying at the hotel across the street. I decided to walk to it in the morning before my flight. The place was not very busy when I walked in and headed to the register, I proceeded to look at the menu and the person there asked if I had questions, I asked what is the popular drink, ended up ordering a latte and a corrisant. It was a big corrisant. The food portion was good and coffee was strong.The decor was industrial style and u kind waited randomly on the other side of where you order for your drink. I grabbed my drink and headed to find an empty spot. Mind you, I had a tiny ass latte all my crap and a corrisant in my hand, it was a struggle but found a spot.Side note: I opted to get an emailed receipt when I paid.I proceeded to get my order and it was pretty good.Fast forward couple hrs later, noticed I hadn't gotten a receipt, called the location was told I can leave a message which I did.Recieved an email, asked what day and time I purchased, did not hear anything back.Literally a month later I finally called back and was FINALLY emailed the receipt.... Horrible customer service, but thank you to the few who tried to help."", ""I always love coming here to escape the busy areas of San Francisco!I ordered their vanilla paste latte -- a new addition since I last visited. It was smooth with just a hint of vanilla. My only complaint would be that it was quite small compared to lattes I get at other coffee shops. I also ordered a Kouign-amann, which was beautifully flakey and just the right amount of sweet.The line at Sightglass moves quickly, so don't be deceived when the line is quite long. I did also visit on a rainy day, so all the seats were taken and people were slow to leave (understandably); usually this isn't an issue.Be warned -- there is no WiFi and no power outlets. This place is wonderful for coffee chats and reading, but if you're looking for a place to do work Sightglass might not be ideal for you."", ""Upon first glance, the place looks good to work at - gentrification at its finest, with potentially amazing coffee, a huge space, and cool people watching. \xa0After spending $17 for 2 12 ounce ice teas and a pastry, I was still excited about working here. \xa0After finding a seat, I was getting ready to enjoy my time focused on the task at hand - except, they don't offer wi-fi. \xa0Epic fail. \xa0Further, no outlets to charge anything. \xa0$@?@ this place! \xa0True testament to the new wave. \xa0They'll be gone when the tech industry collapses,"", ""First time here and I ordered the Ethiopia iced coffee. It was strong, which I like, & it definitely got me going for my afternoon pick me up. Their passion fruit sponge cake is good too. Very light flavor and moist. The place itself is super large with an upstairs area for chillin or doing work. Service itself was so so as in not the friendliest but not awful. Maybe it was the tail end of someone's shift. I'd go back to try their other drinks."", 'Scone was so good! It went perfectly with the coffee. Coffee was overpriced for the amount that was given to us but nonetheless, we still enjoyed our coffee experience! The place is very big and is two stories high! They also pack coffee beans on the side so you can see them putting the coffee beans into the bags and putting them straight on the racks to sell!', ""I definitely appreciate how spacious this place is! Came here with a friend and ordered their only tea on the menu (lol) which was very nice and light. Was more so drawn to this place due to its space! Sad that the place is kind of dark come nightfall, but it is what it is. I'd come back to work if I'm ever in the area again!"", ""Loved the atmosphere inside! Super spacious but wish they had more seating. Saw lots of people doing work on their laptops which is surprising because there's no WiFi.

I asked what they had available for the hand pour, and she said everything, but when I tried to order one of their coffees (Colombia Cauca el Totoro) she said it wasn't available. It'd be helpful if they just had a menu of what was available for hand pour daily like most specialty roasters. I settled on the Ethiopia Sidama. I don't usually interact with the baristas, but my son was infatuated watching them make my coffee and he and the barista had a hilarious (and very loud) discussion about making coffee.

At which point the senior barista threw a fit, declared that the heavy cream (a full half-gallon) was for the ""children\'s hot-chocolate only"" and refused under all circumstances to let me have a splash. Only half and half was offered, and there are dietary reasons that I wanted full-fat cream instead of half-milk.I suppose that I could have demanded a refund on my Americano (none was offered) but I decided to leave it at that.

With the Union Street corridor having many café\'s and coffee shops, this tiny place can get really busy in the early morning. I have been here a few times and every time I get the crafted lattes. For $5.00, the espresso was used by their own beans with whipped organic milk from Strauss creamery. You have to like that combination. The latte has a very flavorful taste of the coffee bean.

Fifty / fifty managed to keep the aroma limited which I appreciate, but the latte still didn't really taste like much.

The place has a about 4 tables with seats and another long table by the window with about 5 stools. They offer free wifi for their customers if you chose to work on things there. They have a nice bathroom but you have to ask the barista for access to it. They offer a stamp card, for every 10 drinks you get 1 for free. If you order multiple drinks and use the stamp card the baristas are usually nice enough to take off the more expensive drink. They have pastries sometimes but it's not my favorite. Drinks on average are $4-5 here.Customer service is excellent here. There are usually 2-3 baristas working at a time and will get to you within a minute or two of you entering the shop. Very patient when you don't know what to order and can offer suggestions. They offer a variety of milk, whole milk, coconut, and almond milk. I believe it does cost extra for the coconut and almond milk.All their selections of teas and coffees are delicious although I tend to order their cappuccino. There have been one or two instances when my cappuccino had just a tad more milk but was delicious regardless. Teas/tea lattes: You can get their teas either iced or hot. Their matcha tea is usually pretty good although sometimes it can be a little bit on the milky side. Their Thai iced tea only comes iced so it's a bummer when you want it warm but usually pretty good. Their lavender earl gray is my personal favorite. You can add boba to any iced teas past noon.

I saw a few interesting drinks and settled on the honey coconut tea latte ($4.50) with almond milk (+$1.00) which I thought was kinda pricey for just almond milk! The drink was delicious, without being too sweet & just the right amount of coconut flavor without being too overpowering. I liked how the almond milk complimented the latte as well- I wonder what kind of tea they use! Overall a decent place to stop by for a quick drink that's close to USF campus!

It\'s not worth it.I have tried this place a handful amount of times. Only because at one point the coffee was good, even though having to brave it up to walk in there. I say that because the ""owner"" Sam is very pushy and rude and thinks he is funny with his side comments and noises he makes. And now his coffee SUCKS!! i don\'t know what or why he changed things up. but its no good. First they downsized the serving of coffee, when asked to fill it to the top as usual he had something to say. ""its quality over quantity!"" I mean I\'m a paying customer?? Fill it to the top! and second all the coffee grounds is sitting at the bottom of my cup and floats around, it sure didn\'t have the same quality as before! And not to mention i ordered 3 coffees.

To top it off I paid $14. for 3 less then 4oz coffees! wait i mean 3oz of coffee and 1oz of coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup!!Its just so disappointing! I will for sure not be returning and encourage the rest to not waste time and money.', 'BEWARE!All these ""amazing"" reviews on here are definitely fraudulent. The saddest part is that apparently they were so mad about bad yelp reviews (due to their rude, pushy scammy service) they even made a sign they posted outside claiming ""people love us on yelp"" after very clearly paying for fake reviews.

He is very pushy about selling you extra stuff every time you come to the store. Once he talked me into buying one of his pastries. The pastry was clearly not fresh, though he, of course, claimed it was. He warmed it up in the microwave(which made it mushy). As I bit into it, he stood behind the counter and added adlibs to my eating experience: he kept saying ""mmmmm, isn\'t that good? Mmmmm yes. Best ever right? Mmmmm yeaaaaaaaahhhhhh"".I switch sides of the road when I approach his coffee house because he\'s so pushy and sleazy.I also suspect that he\'s manipulating the Yelp review system in some way. The amount of positive reviews he\'s gotten, in such a short period of time, is disproportionate for a small, average-quality coffee store, in a residential neighborhood far away from the city center.

It had a matcha green color that seemed natural and not made of food dye. It had a white heart inlay. It took a while for it to be made, but I made it. I had the drink in the cafe. I asked about the pastries and saw a blueberry muffin, scone, and they have empanadas. I could get an empanada another time. Then the lady decided to chop up some of her muffin cake to try.

Saint Frank Coffee,"['I had the perfect latte at Saint Frank. It was the perfect temperature -- not too hot like coffee so often is. The milk was frothed just the right amount. Of course the latte art was beautiful, too. At Saint Frank the baristas measure everything. They weigh the espresso grounds before pulling a shot. Then they weigh the shot. And so on and so forth. Their dedication to precision really shows. The shop is spacious, well lit, geometric.', ""Now that the Third Wave is fully formed and we can stand up and ride our board for a minute, novelty has exhausted itself, and crowds have died down, it's fun to revisit this fine establishment and find that in the absence of so much chaos and hype, they offer a superior product and provide what's actually a very pleasant space in which to remain for a while. This time I went straight for a high-grade pour-over--I've never really seen the point of passing this option up unless you use a place this caliber for your daily cuppa--and it came out lovely, rich and flavorful with brightness on top, all the things high-end coffee is supposed to do.What I liked even more was that it's now possible to find a seat and linger for a while. The wifi policy of wifi only on weekdays, announced in the network name, seems like the right balance. Cell phones for essential information but no serious work; on a weekend everyone must make do with paper or actual human interaction. This would irk me if not announced loud and proud, which it is, and handled this way they get everyone on the same page. I still can't quite bring myself to release five stars when single cup prices often top $6, but I'll allow that here especially in the current configuration you get what you pay for, even if you do pay for what you get."", ""This review is about the wifi and the service not the coffee - the coffee is good. Every time I've been here, which has been 5+ times over the past year the wifi has never worked. Side note: they only offer wifi on weekdays. Today, the baristas looked at me like I had a third head when I said the wifi wasn't working and then tried to blame it on my computer when literally everyone else in the shop was having the same issue. There was a half hearted attempt to fix the issue followed by an equally lackluster apology. I'd understand if this was a one time occurrence, but their wifi issues seem recurrent.

Both of the ones we tried had a certain tang of bitterness to them that I wasn\'t really expecting with the ""apple spiced"" component. I didn\'t really get any of that flavor at all to be honest... If anything, I could tell that the flavor was rich and deep. The coffee beans that they use for sure have a different quality than your average Starbucks coffee. Despite this, I\'ve had better cups of coffee for cheaper all around the Bay Area. SERVICE: It might not be the barista\'s fault, but some girl walked up after we had been waiting in line and asserted herself so she could get her cup first. I wish they had paid better attention to the order or had a more organized system of ordering, but it\'s alright.5/5 for that minimalist aesthetic and modern coffee shop vibe... 3/5 for the overall experience and taste.NOTE: This review is late, so the spiced apple latte was probably a part of their seasonal holiday menu.', ""I brought my cousin here for the coffee flight while we were being cheesy SF tourists.

I was expecting a tart note from the apples, if there is one it's very faint. Quite delicious.

While we waited, I took in the cute little coffee shop- seating downstairs with charging spots for those who like to get work done, and another seating area upstairs (I imagine sans technology support to allow for conversation). The space is bright and welcoming, as was the barista who took our order. Clear from those in line ahead of me, and per the recommendation, the almond macadamia milk latte was the way to go! We ordered two, watched them being made (very cool preparation space and view), paid and were our the door in just minutes! As for the lattes themselves- the almond macadamia nut milk definitely adds a creaminess to the latte.

The first thing to be noticed is the layout and design of the shop. Which is comprised of high ceilings, a clean white square space, and a mezzanine to overlook that overlooks the shop. Coincidentally, it almost mirrors the interior of a Blue Bottle I've visited in Beverly Hills. Comparison notwithstanding, this space does a little more to harbor a more intimate coffee experience. The table and seat colors are invoking of a fall-like vibe. Brown tones meshing with the white interior blanketed by natural light from the large windows in the front, almost feels like a foggy morning and autumn colored leaves await you outside from the cozy inside. The coffee is excellent but displayed accolades on the bean shelf should be telling of that. Whichever direction you choose to go in (coffee, espresso, tea), you're bound to taste something delightful. \xa0Insert warm and friendly baristas, and this is all you could ever ask from a great coffee shop. They've hit all their marks in my book. Saint Frank, cheers to you."", ""Clean, high ceilings, bright and white. \xa0Good service and I tried the Cortado which is an equal mix of warm milk and expresso. \xa0They didn't have the spicy apple caramel flavor but at least I saved some calories! \xa0 We stayed there a couple hours, wifi was good, and got some work done. \xa0Polk street has been really updated with better bike accessibility and good for walking and this is one spot you should check out!"", ""I'm not sold on Saint Frank. I don't get what the hype is about. Sure the space is beautiful and wooden and all that hipster coffee shop decor crap but the coffee offerings are overpriced like a typical cup of SF Joe and the employees are no subject matter experts when it comes to the drinks they brew. C'mon folks, be better champions of the products you make!I was going to opt for their coveted almond macadamia nut latte until I saw the $6 price tag. If I remember correctly my roomie said this drink was so bomb and worth the $5.75 price tag, but looks like they raised it $0.25 since the last time she had it. Sneaky!Wasn't feelin the surge or the new pricing strategy so I opted for their other seasonal latte which had cardamom in it and tasted like a weird bitter chai. Before I had ordered, I asked the blonde barista what the drink tasted like and she had no clue. You'd think that for a coffee bar that offers a narrow selection of drink offerings that the people working there would be more expert on what the food and drinks actually taste like. Maybe they can host a taste test for their employees. This is coffee after all. The space itself is beautiful and there's a lot of light but when I went on a Friday afternoon during lunch time, there was no seating left because all the work from homers took up the entire space with their Macbooks.

I had heard of Saint Frank Coffee and decided to invest in a try today. I looked at the list and she had some recommendations. I wanted to try the espresso. She said I'll get you the iced Americano for $3.50. It came in a glass. She offered me a special almond milk or something and then I needed some sugar or sweetener. The iced coffee was fine. I wanted it decaf as well. Otherwise I would have another sleepless night in SF. It was a treat. I started chatting with someone who ran a running race at Sonoma Lake. He was wearing Patagonia swag.

Their cappuccino is solid; would like to try their flight next time.A little bit of co-worker drama, though, when one of the baristas took my order. He fulfilled the order without a fuss, but didn't make the drink and told the other guy to do it, who in turn, gave him a noticeable eye roll. LOL! What's going on here.

Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"[""Espresso here is STRONGGGGG.I *am* super sensitive to caffeine. Like super sensitive. But the two times I felt that caffeine really messed me up is when I... 1) downed my latte from Flywheel in one sitting (usually I don't ever finish an espresso drink) and I literally threw up at work and 2) when I finished a macchiato from Flywheel in one sitting and I was SWEATING in WholeFoods like I just ran a marathon and my hands were shaking while trying to find star anise in the spices section.The espresso drinks are Very Consistent and delicious. The espresso is flavorful and got a good amount of acidity/fruitiness and body. Their iced mocha is to die for (they use some kind of a darker chocolate so it's not TOO sweet and it doesn't taste fake). I used to drink their iced mochas all the time when I was a student!The space is nice, they have their pastries, ambiance is good for either reading a book, meeting a friend, or studying. Lastly if you want STRONG coffee!! Visit this place!"", ""Okay, I've been here pretty regularly (more than myCheck ins suggest) \xa0and so I can write a review based on consistency. It is a great, dark but open atmosphere and I always end up here because of the 'vibe'. On the other hand, I end up ordering hot chocolate because their coffees are so strong (I don't know if it's because it's drip coffee or it's dark roast) but even the mochas are a tad bit much for me. I love coffee so I've tried everything in their menu (don't worry, the options are limited) and personally it's just not my cup of coffee. ** I don't know if this is a legitimate complaint though, maybe it's me WiFi and outlets though is a legitimate complaint. They do at least have outlets in some of the seatings but still, I've found myself waiting for the spots to open up or leaving because I know my computer will die within the hour thus making $6 hot chocolate not worth it. WiFi is spotty, 75% of the time I come here I'm connecting to the complimentary hour xfinity WiFi or the whole foods one and between that, no outlet and refreshing my page like 50 times and then right before my computer dies , success! (My computer isn't innocent in this either but still ... ) As I write this, I realize that I should probably just stop coming here. I do for the convenience (I live very close by) and the outside space is nice. Today I brought two computers, so maybe I can actually be productive. Good spot for reading though. * this was written as I waited for the WiFi"", 'This place is horrible. \xa0The staff is obnoxiously rude. \xa0Gal with nose ring and tattoos yelled F word at me for bringing in a Whole Foods salad from next door last week. \xa0I almost called the police when the gal approached me. \xa0Gal had a nose ring and tattoos and has worked there for some time. \xa0When I looked up, she walked over from behind the counter, came to my seat and she said ""are you ok?"". \xa0I replied ""yes."" \xa0 She then said, ""you must be a fucking retard for bringing in that salad you fuck."" \xa0I just walked out. \xa0I have been a victim of violence before and this scared the hell out of me. I will seek out management here next time I stop in the area.', ""Came here for a study date and to be honest, we were not that impressed.For starters, when we were trying to order our drinks we were asking the barista for her opinion since we aren't big coffee drinkers and she was not very helpful. There were only 2 of them working but it was not busy enough to where they were slammed with orders, yet as we were trying to ask her questions to order, she kept going back and forth from the register and coffee maker and when asking about drinks, she was very blunt with no real explanation on the differences. Hence why we ended up buying a dang shot glass of coffee instead of a cup.In terms of the actual space, it's very limited. No outlets really around for one to charge their products, stools as seats for a majority of the tables, it's just not the ideal spot to get work done really.Giving two stars because they at least have outdoor seating, but even then, tables are super tiny, and the outdoor location is small itself too.Overall, this place could work for someone looking to take a quick drink of coffee and check ema"", 'First time here. Pricy but good coffee. Great service!!!! Had the columbia coffee and was able to taste the Nitro ( tasted like beer) but had none in it. Cold n YUM!

Ill def be back when i need a kick of caffeine.', 'Flywheel has become by go to coffee stop in the city. Bold and creamy lattes, tasty cortados and delicious pour overs. They do one thing right.... coffee. A definite stop by.', 'Came here this week to quickly work before closing time- great space with different seating but access to outlets.

Will def be back for late night caffeine hits and work space.', ""A great find, right across from Golden Gate Park! SF has its fair share of hipster coffee shops, and Flywheel definitely meets the standard. The interior was very spacious, yet warm and cozy. There's lighting that will fit your mood: dim lighting in the back and plenty of natural lighting in front to enjoy your cup of coffee. There's plenty of small tables, and most people were either reading or on their laptops. The music played at a nice mellow level, so it'd be nice to study here!I ordered a simple iced latte, and my friend got hers with almond milk. Both were delicious! The prices weren't too steep, considering the touristy location and prices of other SF coffee shops. There's also free side street parking, but could be difficult to find a spot. Overall, love the ambiance here!"", ""Great location with latest and greatest in coffee Roastery \xa0so down to atmosphere enjoy your cuppa Java just a really unique place and it's great to have a Roastery in San Francisco where you can watch the process of Roastery prices are kind a high but well it's San Francisco you know so check it out cool place really great coffee basic menu just a lot of fun"", ""I'll start of by saying this is my favorite coffee shop. The attention to detail and the assortment of pastries really make this place a hidden Gem among the sea of Coffee houses in SF. The coffee cake which tastes like it was made with the delicate hands of the Angels with a cappuccino that is expertly crafted to perfection is something I wish I could find on the east coast. My recommendation is get your order to stay. Let the ambiance soak in. The decor is that of an old ship, farmhouse and modern day architecture all blended together. The environment has helped me be productive while also giving me a sense of calm.Anytime I'm in the Upper Haight or in SF, I make a special trip to Flywheel."", 'Nitro coffee is like my crack. It makes me vibrate in a way that no other caffeine product does. So on a Friday morning, when visiting my new nephew in San Fran, this was an excellent choice for a pick me up before heading to the awesome Golden Gate Park playground, just across the street. \xa0The service was friendly, fast and kind. \xa0There was a jovial and heartwarming conversation about a man\'s dog who had just had medical issues and was sweetly lying on the floor waiting for his owner. The server was genuinely interested in the man\'s story and the dog\'s recovery.The space is open and inviting. With enough spots to sit, but also the room to move around freely and get the items you\'ve ordered without getting stuck in the flow of traffic. \xa0I was able to get a vegan donut for my kiddo, who\'s allergic to dairy, and a pizza danish, which was weirdly amazing as a cross between a pastry and a slice of thin crust.I would saunter back to this spot in a heartbeat to get more morning ""get up and go juice"" anytime I\'m in town!', ""Flywheel is conveniently close to my workplace, so a few of us decided to make a stop after work. We were in search of a place to sit and chat, and found a comfortable round table in the back. The area is quite spacious, and while there is wifi offered the speeds are incredibly slow. My friend found it faster to use the nearby Whole Foods wifi instead.I'm not a coffee drinker, so I opted for the hot chocolate. My friend got the coffee and felt like it was solid. The hot chocolate however was mediocre at best. I was quite underwhelmed by the flavor, and felt that the overall chocolate taste was lacking in strength. The hot chocolate was also lukewarm, and I expected better quality for the price.Overall, Flywheel seems like a reasonable place to meet up with friends, or take a little change of environment by studying / working at a coffee shop. In terms of the hot chocolate however, I would likely go somewhere else instead for my next cup."", ""I have been to this coffee house twice now and love it. All of the staff are lovely and helpful, and they make a great latte which is my drink of choice. I'm lactose and they have several milk substitute options including soy, almond and coconut. The only bummer (and this is something I've noticed at other coffee houses in San Francisco) is that they don't sell sizes here. Everything is the same tall/maybe grande cup size. I wish I could get something more!The layout of Flywheel is huge. There are several large tables in front and an outdoor space as well with several more spots to sit down. Definitely a place you could come with large groups and you wouldn't feel guilty taking up space. I would also recommend coming here to do work or homework - lots of front window bar space and stools to sit. Even when it's busy, there are usually still a few open spots.The menu of drinks is located on the whole and they also sell small food items/baked goods.

Upon entering there was no greeting from the baristas, which I was fine with since they were making drinks. Being this was my first time here, I had no idea what to order, what their drink menu was or what the ordering process was like. I walked up to the counter and saw the iPad facing towards me and I thought maybe I\'m suppose to just order it myself. I figured if I had to wait to order that the barista who was less than a foot away from me and the ipad would say ""I\'ll be right with you"" or something along the lines of that. Since he did not say anything, I made an assumption that maybe I was suppose to order through the iPad since I have been to places that have an iPad ordering station. Since the iPad was already facing me, I looked to see what they had besides what was written on the wooden menu on the back wall. When the barista finally came over to me and he gave me a dirty look before he pushed the iPad towards himself to ask for my order. \xa0I asked if they could make a vanilla latte considering \xa0the menu had latte is an option. The barista said, ""we don\'t have syrups"" in a rude response because he was obviously irritated that I look at the iPad and almost proceeded to click the buttons to order myself. All this unnecessary attitude could have been prevented if the baristas would have just greeted the customers so that they know you will be with them shortly instead of having them figure out what to do.', ""Something I ate here disagreed with my stomach.

And a Latte? Yep/ you guessed it- order a latte. There's a difference, but here you don't have to explain it to the barrista.

I ordered their cold brew and it's everything you want from a nice cold brew. Good quality coffee, smooth finish, and just a fantastic flavor. Their star of the show though is their Matcha Latte.

Definitely recommend stopping by."", ""I was in the Duboce/Church area of the Castro today. I decided to stop by this coffee shop at the Fitness SF gym. I wanted a bagel with egg. At first, it was bagel with cream cheese, and I changed my mind. It was $4.25. I already had a coffee from Peet's nearby. Then I had to use the restroom and they gave me a pass at the cafe. Fitness SF is a gay gym. haha"", ""One of my favorite coffee shops in the city. This is one of those chill spots you can grab a coffee, pull up a laptop, and crank out your work for the day. You might even catch some eye candy on their way to the gym next door ;).I love their matcha options. I've gotten their matcha protein (matcha, milk, and a scoop of protein powder) and matcha prepared americano style (hot water). They also have to-go drinks, snacks, and the drip coffee is solid.There's plenty of seating, and there's outlets for charging phones/laptops under the tables. A heads up that this place can get a little crowded, but table space usually opens up after some time. The WiFi is nice and strong.An added bonus? The Castro Farmer's Market happens right across the street each Wednesday."", ""Ritual is just across the street, but it felt so pretentious that we immediately ducked into Weaver's for our lattes and hot chocolates instead. On a rainy day, this spot can't be beat.I ordered a hot chocolate and asked about the non-dairy options. My barista was accommodating and very friendly, and said that while he couldn't guarantee the chocolate would be dairy-free, they offered soy, almond, and coconut milks as alternatives. Totally fine by me and my stomach! The hot chocolate was really good. Not only did it come out steaming hot, they even accommodated and made me a swirly foam peak instead of topping it with whipped cream. A small hot chocolate is $3.75, and dairy-free milks are an additional 50 cents.There is WiFi and plenty of seating for people who want to duck in and do some work. I love the interior -- it faces out toward Market, so you can do loads of people-watching.The bathroom situation is kinda hard to work, though. My companions had to get the bathroom pass, duck into the gym next door, head upstairs, and walk down a hallway of mirrors (...?) to get to the restroom.

Really.....I don't mind. : ) This Sightglass Coffee is located on Divisadero Street in the Lower Haight area of San Francisco. There's plenty of street parking around the area, both metered and free parking. If you drive closer to the residential areas, there's free parking. So what I notice that people complain about is how there's no Wifi here and also no outlets too. Wow, that is the one thing I really don't like about some coffee shops though. I go there to have some coffee with my friend and just try to chill for a hour out of the day. We enter and see that there's a bunch of customers sitting inside with their laptops and piles of books all over the tables. There's no telling how long they've been there and how long they will stay. Meanwhile we're just looking for a place to have a nice conversation and some coffee, not a place where people act like they're in a library. Hey I've been a student before. I understand the pain of finding a place to study/do homework that's not at home. It's fine, but give other customers a chance to sit. Another complaint is that you may have to share a table with other people you don't know. Really, unless they are contagious with some deadly disease, I really don't mind.

Anyways, we ended up ordering a vanilla iced cold brew w/almond milk and a latte with almond milk. Both of these were good, but I did feel like the almond milk with the latte was a little too nutty for my taste.

Like most places nowadays they had your non-dairy milks, always appreciated and some food options too that I didn't dabble in but definitely would next time. Tried tasting as many different coffees from various places in San Francisco as I could during my first visit and this place definitely had one of my favorite cups!"", ""Large café with tons of light and comfy seating. This would be a good spot to meet up with a friend. I tried to work from here too but there's no wifi. Also, they have great drinks (vanilla cold brew!). For those lactose intolerant folks, almond milk is an option (no upcharge!) Would definitely recommend."", ""Very modern, lofty Sightglass location. Lots of people working but not primarily a working spot, which I'm appreciate. (Places where everyone is working is a bit depressing to me.)The service was quick, and the drinks were good.

If you don't come before 11 there are sparse pickings for food, and if you don't come before 12 you are very lucky if they aren't 100% sold out. Two of every three visits I arrive only to turn right back around because there's no food left. I don't understand! Please buy more!"", ""Sightglass is a great place to stop in for delicious coffee! It's located on Divisadero in the Lower Haight. It's easy to walk to if you're out and about on Divis, or to park near if you're not. (There is metered parking on Divis itself where spots are almost always available, and free 2-hour parking on the side streets nearby). Anyway, I'm a huge fan of cold brew and am always on the lookout for places that serve a great one. Sightglass is one of those places! I always get the vanilla cold brew with almond milk which is so, so good: the coffee is strong and not diluted or watery, but still nicely flavored by the natural tasting vanilla, and smooth to sip on without being overly sweet.They also have a decent selection of interesting sweet and savory pastries to accompany your beverage. Prices are on par with other coffee shops, as is seating (limited, but perhaps higher turnover than places that allow laptop camping). I'm a fan overall!"", ""The cafe is spacious, open and brings in a lot of light. It has a great ambiances for a morning latte and quick pastry. It is also a fantastic spot to plug in for some long hours of studying. This is my third visit to this location and it won't be my last."", ""Sightglass is my favorite coffee shop in SF. Video sketch on 3 of their shops. youtu.be/CKyLAk5jzuQThis location is on Divisadero. (Walk south a little bit from Nopa) Compared to shops in SOMA(large) or Mission(small), this space is medium size. It's not that hard to find seating. Even though there are only group tables, it's a good place to work as well. The details they put in lighting, color, furniture, tile, etc.. are very thoughtful alongside the coffee itself. You get a warm and special feeling when you are in their shops."", ""The ambiance of this coffee shop is awesome, super open bright and clean and a great space to get work done. The coffee is pretty strong and on the pricier end. You don't get a lot of coffee for you money but what you do get is high quality. Definitely a spot to pop into if you're in the area!"", ""Another location of Sightglass has popped up on Divisadero and it is on par with the other amazing locations throughout the city. The iced vanilla cold brew, for which they are so famous, was noticeably smoother here than the ones I had tasted at the Mission and Soma shops. It really does taste like there is proper vanilla in that drink, rather than just being sweet and syrupy. The nitro cold brew but a bit more bitter than I would appreciate, but it was still a smooth drink overall and I'd recommend it over a hot cup of coffee on a warm day in San Francisco. The location lacks outlets and Wifi to discourage people from camping out with their laptops all day. It also got pretty warm inside, which wouldn't normally be an issues except it was a rare sunny day in SF.Overall, you'll be a fan of this location if you're a fan of the other Sightglass locations. Nothing too new or unique here, just in a new neighborhood.""]","['5.0 star rating', '2.0 star rating', '3.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '3.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating']"
CoffeeShop,"[""Such a cute little place!! I've had CoffeeShop bookmarked for the longest time, and this past weekend, I got to stop by!!I got an iced latte with oat milk. They have Oatly!! So many places are out right now due to a shortage, but THEY HAD IT!!!!!!! The latte was nice and strong. Bold without being bitter. I thought it was really cute that the ice cubes were made of coffee and not water. The drink tasted even better when they had melted. Such a nice concept!! More often than not, I'm unable to finish my latte before the ice melts, and it just ends up tasting watered down...but not here!!I also got to try the Sherpa (aka Bulletproof). This is made using butter and coconut oil. I enjoy Bulletproof coffee, so I liked this, but the taste may not be for everyone. It's super rich and will leave you feeling fullBottom line: Kinda pricy but pretty much what you can expect for quality coffee in the area. I wanna come back and try the peanut butter honey cinnamon toast!! There was one man running this whole shabang. Genuinely impressed. It's a pretty small place, but there are a few tables outside. Grab an iced latte and make the short trek up the hill to Bernal Heights Park for an SF vibin' morning--hills for breakfast, gorgeous views, and a caffeine buZzZzZzz!!"", 'I\'ll admit I\'m a coffee snob (ha). \xa0But who doesn\'t love a ""hug from the inside?!"" \xa0When I heard this spot serves the infamous bullet proof coffee I had to try it and see what all the hype was about. \xa0I\'ve made it at home before but everything tastes better when someone else makes it for you, right? Order their Sherpa coffee (large if you drink as much as I do). \xa0They use Kerigold butter and coconut oil and throw it in a blender with their tasty coffee. \xa0Your first sip of the Sherpa gives you instant energy that\'ll last through out the day. Parking - street parking', ""$15.00 for two iced lattes that aren't even all that? No thank you. The only reason I didn't walk away from paying that was because the woman had already made it. But I should have. The flavor wasn't all that and it wasn't good. Not sure if the girl just sucked at making the drinks but how do you mess up an iced latte? Just don't go and go to Philz or Tierria Mia"", ""This shop really pays attention to the little things - and they matter! A lot! First of all, this is the first place I've been to that actually foams the milk in its iced lattes! A definite plus for me. Also, the ice cubes in my latte were made from coffee so it doesn't get diluted when the cubes melt. The latte itself was quite strong surprisingly (since my lattes usually aren't) and good flavor. Definitely check this cute place out if you're in the Mission District!"", ""It's a nice area with 2 hour parking in the neighborhood.. nice and small the coffee shop , tasty \xa0drinks . Better than other place !!"", ""The challenge I was given was: Find a top 5 coffee place in all of San Francisco. After a lot of research, I hit upon this gem, in the mission.Ironically, we had passed this tiny, shoe-box sized, family owned place, several times - it is easy to miss. Once you are inside, your are greeted with the aromas of cawfee, and baked goods. They have an excellent selection of baked goods, including, vegan, dairy-free, gluten-free options form donuts to date rolls to many other coffee accouterments.This is a pour-over coffee paradise. Be prepared for the owner to recommend the right coffee (he tunes into you), by specifying if you are light, dark or medium roast person. I picked dark, and he recommended an excellent crop from Brazil. My friend picked medium, and he recommended Ethiopia. She knows her coffee, and as a SF native, she felt this was right at the top.They also have almond, half and half and many types of milk choices, as well as the less adventurous lattes, mochas, teas, espressos. The owner said their secret sauce is customer service - and we experienced the warmth and genuine passion of a master barista, who hand picks the shop's blends."", 'Love this place. The coffee is so strong and smells amazing. Literally makes me excited how good the coffee smells while I drive.

I was seriously blown away by the coffee ice cubes because that just shows me they try and care about their coffee. On top of that, the coffee was delicious. It's a small shop and they sell a variety of drinks and pastries. They've got some interesting concoctions but I normally just go for the simple drinks so you'd have to try that for yourself.Service was great! The staff was friendly and quick. Overall great place to stop by for coffee!"", ""What a gem!!! Quaint little shop with coffee ice cubes. The iced beverages are served in hot cups. Unique :) The owner(?)/ barista gave me a run down on what kind of coffee it was that I was about to drink. You can tell it's a local favorite, seemed like he knew the customers by name!"", 'What a charming little coffeehouse with good service. Due to atmosphere, convenience, being open, customer service and that delicious coffee it`s a five star visit.', ""THE bestest chai lattes in all the land!Small little shop where we usually grab two chais and some delicious cookies to go whenever we're in the area running errands.

Wooden Coffeehouse,"[""Best coffee shop in SF!

Friendly staff, cute African Grey Parrot in the back (Santos), and of course delicious, expertly made lattes."", ""Best coffee in the neighborhood. Hands down. It even edges out Luke's (though barely). They even have good decaf for when I want to drink coffee later in the day. However, the prices for this coffee exceed the neighborhood average by about a buck. (espresso, for example: elsewhere it's $2, here it's $3.25). The bathroom is immaculate. It has zero smell. Service ranges from gruff to super-friendly.The wifi is terrible. Barely useable. I was getting better bandwidth tying my computer to my crappy cellphone. The seating fine. Coffeehouse standard. Not as good as Reverie. Better than Peet's. Four stars!"", 'HORRIBLE !!!Greasy, oil slick coffee. No honey option, ""sorry I\'m out of it""? Really ... so I give the lady the empty dairy container. You think she\'d say anything more than ""thanks""? How about refilling it or asking if I needed more which I did. Good-luck here, I\'d be surprised if this place can last 2 years. And oh thank you very much, who the fuck is the weirdo with the exotic bird on his shoulder behind the counter? Keep that shit up & you will have a City health inspector up your ass.', ""Matcha latte (w whole milk) was a solid three stars. Good matcha flavor, but not as strong as I like it. Compared to CoffeeShop in the mission and Reveille matcha lattes, Wooden Cafe doesn't compete wellGreat service - they totally made me feel normal despite me asking many questions about the sweetness level. I felt like they were genuinely concerned and really wanted me to enjoy the drinkWould come back if I was in the area, but would not go out of my way for it"", ""This coffeehouse is GREAT! They recently added more signage on the outside of the building which I hope will bring in more people because I didn't even realize it was a coffee shop until I finally went inside today. I don't know if this means I wasn't paying attention or if their window signage is a little dark to clearly read from afar/across the street.I love to drink my coffee with Oak milk. I am lactose and I definitely don't like almond milk in my coffee (it completely changes the taste) and soy milk can be a little too thin and watery. Oat milk is so much thicker, so much tastier and it's better for the environment. I ordered a latte with oat milk, there are no real sizes here - the drinks on the board come out as a ~grande size unless you order a cortado (which is inherently smaller). I chatted with the barista the entire time I was in the coffee house - she was lovely and friendly and made a great coffee.The space is well filled with tables and places to stand. I could definitely see myself coming back when I work remotely. It's also right next to a Muni stop so it's very convenient to grab and go on your way to work or your way out for the day.They even have a bird! It was not there when I was here, but there were bird perches set up all over the place."", ""Great cafe and friendly staff; I like the coffees and lattes too, they make them with care!Overall it's a top coffee shop around the area and they have a bird in there too :)"", 'Wooden Cafe is a cute cafe in Cole Valley PROS: -Coffee is delicious. I got a latte and the latte art was very well done and the milk was foamy with little tiny bubbles. Coffee itself was good.-Bathroom is one of the cleanest cafe bathrooms I have ever been in. Probably because the door is camouflaged-Located on a busy family friendly street. Good for people watching. Cute decorations and themeCONS:-WiFi is very slow. Would not work on internet here. This place is more for reading or hanging out or studying without WiFi.-No water spigot - have to ask for glass of water -Coffee is not cheap', 'When I tell friends who don\'t live in San Francisco how hard it is to find a good writing place, they\'re shocked when I can only list a few off the top of my head. San Francisco has a world-class coffee scene. Truly. But in terms of coffeehouses where you can sit, relax for awhile, and/or work, San Francisco doesn\'t have many spots that allow you to spread out. Well, friends and Yelpers, I found a coffeeshop that does everything right: Wooden. Why do I love this place? I think listing my reasons are more efficient given my enthusiasm for this spot:1. Conveniently located off the 43 MUNI bus and N MUNI train. Very easy to get to if you\'re a public transit user like me. 2. Simple menu -- which, to me, tells me they\'re ""no fuss"" and only want to serve the essentials and do those really well. They also serve a variety of pastries (e.g. almond croissant, cookies). One of their special drinks though is ""The Thing."" (More on this marvelous concoction later.) 3. Nice baristas. Yvette, Steve, and Jetter (I believe I got those names right!) run the show. They\'re all friendly and make consistently delicious beverages. 4. Fantastic furniture+space+ambiance -- wooden chairs and tables, walls, floors... I mean, truly wood everywhere (hence the name?). The seats are comfortable and serve ""vintage chic"" vibes. Plus, there\'s enough seating for folks to read a book, commune with friends, or work (like I tend to do there). By the way, there aren\'t many wall outlets so I\'d suggest coming with fully-charged devices. There\'s a restroom in the back through the left door. Also, depending on who is working, they usually play some good indie music so ya know I\'ve got my Shazam ready every few songs. (Hi. I\'m James. I love indie pop and dream pop. kxthbye.)5. ""The Thing"" -- OK, this drink is tremendous. It\'s a cinnamon-based latte that, to me at least, reminds me of an iced latte spiked with the flavors of horchata. I don\'t know if that was intentional or not, but hey, I LOVE IT. They also make a fantastic iced chai (my next favorite at Wooden). So, there are my five reasons and praises for Wooden. After being spoiled with the good coffeehouse cultures of Chicago and even DC, I can\'t tell you how much I appreciate a place like Wooden in the city.', ""Love this coffee spot! Lot's of natural light, great coffee and bonus - they have oat milk, yum!"", ""Can we first talk about the parrot here? He can make the beeping sound of a city freight truck backing up so perfectly, that I thought someone was getting a delivery to their shop in Cole Valley about every 5 minutes. It's incredible. Besides the parrot, I came here to do some work one day. The place can get crowded and there's very few outlets to charge your devices.

The beautiful and tall clay pot has a handle and is delivered to your table on a wooden platter with brown sugar and cream, which are optional, and a tiny basket of cardamom popcorn, which is not - so yummy. It takes about 10 minutes to brew, which is worth it for a ""coffee experience"" beyond the capacity of any Starbucks. I think it was $6.50 for the small clay pot and $9.50 for a large. They also have Turkish coffee and your typical express drinks. It\'s a great place to chill. Zo11 plays great music. With the tall windows, it\'s a nice and bright, art-filled space with 5 two-tops and a tall four-top. Free Wi-Fi too! I wish there was a place like this in my neighborhood.

They have slowly been adding plants and arts and it looks great! I have to say, the dollar sign is not correct for a coffee shop, I would say $4.5 late would be a two dollar sign category. Regardless, they have good coffee, nice decor inside, and my favorite is their backyard. I just go there to have some coffee and sit in the sun. :)', ""Matcha latte was great - strong and flavorful like it should be. Definitely one of the best matcha lattes I've had in the city. The vibe is relaxed and inviting, and it's easy to get work done. Modern but not overly gentrified, cozy but well kept. Extra points for the r&b jams. SF native approved!"", ""This coffee shop is very bright & had a welcoming vibe. Like another helper has said, I don't think this is a $ establishment. The prices are pretty high, but maybe it's because we're in the city. When we went, they only had the barako beans, which is a very dark and bitter roast. I'm glad I got a matcha latte because I'm a medium roast kinda gal. On to the matcha latte... it was honestly lacking the matcha flavor I was wanting based on other great reviews. Maybe it was just my cup, but was latte was quite watery and I had no honey flavor until I got to the very bottom of my cup. The lattes itself were made beautifully, the milk frothed perfectly, but the flavors just did not wow me."", ""I love visiting new coffee shops in the city but I was a bit disappointed by Ballast. Reasons include: they were out of their speciality barako blend (special coffee blend from the Philippines that I was excited to try) and the matcha americano I got was so bitter and tasteless that I couldn't finish more than half of it. I also love matcha too so it was surprising that I didn't like it at all.I did like the minimalist decor and there were a lot customers there with their laptops enjoying their day. I also enjoyed the Third Culture mochi donuts. I tried the ube and passion fruit. I will have to think about if I want to go back and try their special blend."", ""This is a really great coffee shop. It feels like home and there is plenty of seating, tables, and even an outdoor courtyard that is really nice. Their coffee means I tried that day was from the Philippines which was really different.

Plenty of plugs and Wi-Fi too which is good if you have to do some work on your laptop.I'll be back to Ballast Coffee."", ""First of all, such a friendly atmosphere for sure! Glad to walk in here to be greeted lightly by the workers here and sometimes it's nice to get asked how you're day is going, don't ya think? Even if it's part of their job. Enough with the random babblings and onto the good stuff..Coffee is good, my go-to is their matcha latte w/ almond milk but if they do run out of that i opt for any other interesting coffee.. so far i've tried the Barako latte w/ almond milk and the reg. cappuccino, all rich with the tasty flavor. the ambiance is chill and the music is perfect, not too loud and too mainstream, more on the mellow side. which is good for studying or what not. you can still definitely talk over the music if you're in there for a meeting or coffee with a friend. i like how almost all tables have outlets. they also have seats in the back (almost like a backyard area) during the day if you want some vitamin D while sipping on your coffee / tea or water! plenty of sunlight here so that's why i like coming here as well. would totally be back here, since it's simply a muni ride here for me and west portal have pretty good restaurants nearby in case you get hungry for lunch or dinner."", 'I have been to this cafe once before it was renovated. I miss this location because of the indoor and outdoor settings which are friendly to work at. I LIKE it even moreee after the renovation! It is way more spacious, clean, quiet and comfortable to hang out for an afternoon! \xa0It is crazy how thoughtful the design of this place is, you get to choose sitting on a couch, at a small table, big table, bar, or even outdoor table! I definitely enjoy sitting at the big wooden table in the back because it is more hidden and relaxing! Drink: I asked the barista the difference between a cappuccino ($4) and a cortado ($4), he told me the cortado is the same as the cappuccino but just with less milk. I ordered it and regretted it right away because it tasted like a creamy shot to me, but I will definitely go back and try their other drinks next time :) Sweet: \xa0they have 4-5 flavors of cake. I tried a matcha custard cake ($4) and a ube custard cake ($4), very moist! I wish they have more food/cake choices herePro: the location is very easy for parking, there is a plenty of 2 hr parking a block away. \xa0Restroom is clean!! Staffs are friendly!!

Came in around 12:30pm on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty packed, there was no more indoor seating but there was space on the patio outdoors which was super nice, but unfortunately there are no outlets. By 2:00pm the place was packed, including the patio so if you're interested in studying or working here probably aim to get here earlier in the morning.I got the Just Like Honey tea, which was $4. It comes in a nice glass teapot that turns into a cup lmao which I thought was super cute. The tea itself was okay; would have liked a little bit stronger flavor personally but I still enjoyed it.I left about 1.5 hours after getting here because my laptop died lol. So yeah, if you're trying to do a work day here, probably try to get here earlier. Would recommend around 9am-10am."", 'Great little neighborhood cafe serving distinct, quality beverages - featuring Barako Coffee from the PI - with nice backyard seating to boot!I stumbled upon this cafe when searching for good coffee spots in The City. I was intrigued by their Barako Coffee offering, a varietal originating from the Philippines. This was my first time hearing of coffee grown in the Philippines, and was surprised and excited to find Ballast Coffee serving this rare product in SF. Inside, it can get a bit dark, especially in the middle section of the space, right at the register and bar. But things open and brighten up the further you move back, where you\'ll find seating with high chairs as well as a communal table, terminating in a nice and open backyard setup. It seems to be good spot for work or study: plenty of people on their laptops and devices. On our visit, we went Barako crazy, ordering two Barako cappuccinos, a Barako espresso, and a matcha custard cake (from Third Culture Bakery). They had other pastry options, including day-old donuts from Dynamo at 50% off. Sweet deal.I liked the Barako beans. Ballast calls it a ""big, hearty brew,"" and I agree. \xa0The espresso reminded me of a more traditional flavor, tasting like a darker roast, with a kind of deep earthiness, full body, and low acidity: in line with attributes commonly found in varietals produced in Southeast Asia. It\'s a welcomed alternative to the typical Third Wave flavor profile offerings found in SF. The steamed milk in the cappuccino sweetened things up ever so slightly, making a well balanced cup. I would definitely come back to have these beverages again!All in all, a great place to sit down and enjoy a unique cup of coffee!', ""Not bad at all! Came here on a Saturday afternoon looking for some coffee and a place to work. I've visited the old coffee shop that was here before it became Ballast and the space has definitely brightened up. I ordered a cappuccino and sat at one of their smaller tables to work. It seemed like a popular place since everyone around me was there working on their laptops, homework, or writing, which created a great working environment for me. They apparently have outdoor tables which I would love to check out once the weather gets nicer. Their single working tables are pretty small, and the bar-like counter was also small. There is also a larger table in the back of the shop if you're looking for more space."", ""YuckThe former Green House Cafe was warm and inviting. It had cozy areas for either solo work or small groups. \xa0It had FOOD and it was pretty good. \xa0Now. \xa0It's cold, modern, horrible tinky music that's way too loud and distracting. \xa0The new modern look and layout makes all sound reverberate and bounce off walls. \xa0It's about as warm and inviting as a refrigerator.Now. \xa0No food! \xa0And their wall board that lists beverages is impossible to read unless you walk behind the counter and get on top of it!They were also out of the coffee they claim to specialize in. \xa0Strange place. \xa0Won't be back"", ""This place had good coffee and friendly service, but I wasn't a fan of the space itself.My husband and I enjoyed our Americanos. \xa0Also, the cups they were served in were quite attractive.The setting unfortunately felt a bit cold and sterile - I'm afraid the old, unattractive floor tile took away from the decor. \xa0Also, it was disappointing that the bathroom did not have a changing table (we were there with our baby).Overall, a good spot to get coffee in West Portal."", ""This place is an amazing place to get work done. The cafe is spacious and clean with modern decor. It wasn't crowded when I was here on a Monday afternoon. It isn't too loud, they have relaxing music playing in the background. The wifi password is on the counter and it is fast. The staff is very friendly and occasionally sing along with the radio lol. The coffee here is great and was strong enough to power me through a couple hours of work. Overall a great study spot in West Portal."", 'very, very intriguing. What had really caught my eye on this place was the fact that they serve Barako coffee, a coffee varietal indigenous and produced mainly in the Philippines. It is known for its strong, bold flavor, but it is not always well received. It\'s sharp and poignant, but is mainly dependent on its roast flavor rather than the bean itself. I have sampled and drank a many different Barako offerings, and they all generally lean towards very dark flavors. Good for you ""dark"" coffee drinkers. Such reasons are why I was surprised to see such an...acquired coffee to be offered here, so brownie points for being ambitious. Now, the shop itself is very quaint and small, the ceiling is fairly low and may seem a tad cramped. But it is spacious and welcoming with its layout and theme of white. They do have a back area if the inside doesn\'t suit you. They source their pastries from a very good handful of known bakeries in SF, such as Dynamo Donuts. Aside from their Barako offering, their other espresso is very smooth and generally more well balanced, which I preferred. They also have matcha as another alternative offering for those who like matcha. All in all I was happy with my visit and I\'m glad to see a coffee shop (THE ONLY ONE IN THE BAY AREA) serve such a generally unknown coffee varietal (as a permanent offering). I salute you Ballast!', ""I've been an irregular customer, as it were, since a couple of months after Ballast opened. I was not a habituee of the old joint that seems to have been beloved by many. \xa0Even though I dig the space, I'd file this cafe under 'Hit or Miss'. I've had well-rendered drinks from (one of the) owner(s) who is there on and off. More often than not, I've had drinks made by folk who aren't actually up to snuff yet in the drinks-making department. This means, of course, that one is either spending four plus bucks on a good milk and espresso drink or not. And the latter scenario bunk. I mean, who likes paying to be a guinea pig? New hires learning how to make drinks on the job, i.e. drinks patrons are shelling out bucks for ain't kosher. (I understand that this is a somewhat common practice, but I still don't dig it.)The last time I was in Ballast, a new hire (the boss was training him while I was there, so I'm not guessing that he was newly employed) was making my capp while making small talk with the owner. I had wanted the boss to make the drink, but no such luck. I was hoping the new-hire wouldn't be distracted by the chat, but, given that the milk was overly hot and the espresso had a talc/tannic quality about it, it would seem that he had been. Dude set the drink on the saucer, gave not one glance at me, and, while still facing his boss, told him that he was unhappy with the foam art on my drink. I'm one foot over the counter from you, so why don't you not talk about how your drink doesn't measure up in front of patrons, or tell me directly. In all reality, I don't give a fig if you can make a feather or a heart or a gosh darn toy poodle in the foam. I do care that you don't scald the milk, do have the right grind, do have a machine that's been correctly calibrated, etc. It's substance over form all day long. If you can achieve both, then fab. If not then err on the side of the drink being balanced. \xa0If you don't really care how your drink tastes or if you're not ordering espresso and milk drinks, then Ballast is a modern, tidy space you may well enjoy spending time in.**Back patio seating. **Tidy loo."", ""New-ish place. We were sad to see Green House go but Ballast has been an awesome addition to the neighborhood, great for the days when Peet's is feeling too generic. Enjoying a wonderfully strong latte this morning, really taking the edge off the Monday fog."", 'Came into the coffee shop today and there was a guitarist playing...softly. \xa0Just like the coffee shops of your dreams. \xa0We enjoyed the latte coffee (split between the 3 of us), enough caffeine to power through the rest of the afternoon! \xa0Come and smell the coffee! \xa0I would have liked to stay and relax in the empty outdoor patio area, maybe next time!', ""One of my absolute favorite cafes in the city. I come here multiple times a week just to get a drink and read a book! There's a good amount of seating, but it usually fills up pretty quickly around the afternoon time. They play good music and the ambiance is really nice. The baristas are all really friendly too. I've ordered the matcha green tea latte and the genmaicha green tea before, and both were really good. I've never had an issue with parking. I park about 2 blocks down where there's 2 hour parking.I would highly recommend this place!!"", ""Met a friend here recently after an incredible lunch at Bursa. Wow! It's unassuming from the outside but is a beautiful hip, spacious haven inside. Staff are really nice and knowledgeable and seriously aim to please. Art of the walls is pretty and much appreciated. It's got a minimal flavor in Ballast - a little goes a long way. It is hip that's for sure (did I mention?) but not overpriced or snooty. It feels like a very down to earth vibe even though yes it is exquisitely curated throughout. The best thing about this spot was the terrace out back. What a sun trap if you go at the right time of day. My friend and I messed around with taking some polaroid pics, chatting to other Ballast coffee frequenters, and chilling in the March sunshine. My friend had a drip coffee which she liked and I had a matcha green tea latte unsweetened which was divine! So so good and of course, this place being the kind that pays attention to detail, the drink was finished beautifully with gorgeous latte art!

Great for 4 ish people.Mini cakes - I got 3 ($7 each) of these, but these are SO WORTH. It has an explosion of flavor that I was not expecting. So good!

I asked what they did have and she said that she didn't know !?This was 2pm on a Wednesday!"", ""Oh, chocolate banana almond croissant, how I love you. This is probably my favorite thing to eat here. As someone who is usually not a huge fan of almond croissants because I think they're too sweet, b. patisserie gets the combo just right, given that the chocolate and banana are in the mix too. What you get is a croissant that in some parts is flaky (you know, the kind where some of it falls onto the plate or hand you have conveniently beneath it so you can crunch on the crunchy bits) and sometimes has that soft, crumbly frangipane--perfect. A good amount of chocolate and banana, nicely mixed together. My favorite is when it's still slightly warm and the chocolate is slightly melty.The kouign-amann are also good, and I think what b. patisserie is known for given they sell keychains in that shape, but I just love the banana chocolate almond croissant more. I think I like the softness and different textures of the croissant, vresus the kouign-amann is pure flake and sugar. You can get the chocolate one, I think it's an extra $0.75 for them to pour chocolate sauce on it."", ""STOP EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING and come to B Patisserie!HOLY SMOKES, maybe it's because I haven't had my fair share of pastries all over the world, but W-O-W, everything I've ever tried here has been TOP NOTCH PHENOMENAL delicious !!Prices are a bit up there, but well worth it for delectable, well-made, flaky-even-the-next-day-GOODNESS.1) Kouign Amann -- ignore your wallet and just get one. There's a reason why this is their BEST seller. A different type of MORE FLAKY CRIPSY GOODNESS than a typical croissant. Ugh, dreaming about the next time I can take a bite out of you. They also have rotating flavored ones, such as the strawberry rhubarb I tried a couple of weeks ago. Superb!Oh lawdddd, I'm not even a chocolate person, but their chocolate kouign amann is a MUST.2) Chocolate Banana Almond Croissant - yes, yes, and YES. Literally heaven with every bite. They also sell baguettes for around $2 .. ish?This place totally has the vibe of sitting down, relaxing, catching up with a friend or a date ;) over coffee and a delicious pastry.~~ BAE Patisserie -- mmMmMmM ~~ !!"", ""One of the highlights of my SF trip! Don't be intimidated by the long line outside.. it actually moves pretty quickly because they're hella organized and have an efficient system going on. Their pastries were one of the freshest and tastiest pastries I've ever had in my entire life. Guaranteed fresh cause you literally see them rolling out all the pastries on super speed mode! Perfect balance of flakiness and sweetness!

B Patisserie did not disappoint!PARKING: Street parking. We Ubered there!AMBIENCE: Brightly lit, marble counter tops with the pastries on display in a nice long row. All you can ask for in a bakery cafe.PRICING: Prices seem pretty fair for quality baked goods. Most pastries are about $4-5 each.FOOD: We ordered the CHOCOLATE KOUIGN-AMANN, which was by far our favorite, which isn't a surprise as it's one of their most popular items. This was my first time having a kouign-amann but it's essentially a caramelized croissant. Sugary, crispy, flaky and BUTTERY goodness. It honestly didn't even need the chocolate. The HAM & CHEESE CROISSANT was also a great savory, tasty pastry. I've never had a ham & cheese croissant like this one, since the cheese seems to be baked on top, but even with that it still manages to hold that crispiness to it. Amazing. The last thing we got was a slice of their VEGGIE QUICHE. I didn't expect it to be cold so that was kind of off-putting, but the flavor was delicious nonetheless.SERVICE: Very friendly and efficient!

Great place to get treats to treat yourself or to get it as a gift for others. As mentioned in many reviews, the Kouign Amann is a deifnite must try. It's almost like a denser croissant that is richer and more structured. The outer layer is crispy with a sweet glaze on top and the inside has many soft and chewy layers. I recommend the original because the ones with the filling make the pastry a little soggy. \xa0The second must try pastry is their Almond Croissant. The croissants here are much more dense than your typical croissant. Rather than being fluffy and light, the croissants here are more crusty and thick. The filling inside has good flavor and the texture of crunchy outside and soft inside makes this pastry extra yummy. The Chocolate Chip Cookie is half crunchy and half doughy. The inside/middle part of the cookie is definitely not baked all the way through (which some people like!). It is very sweet, with many pieces of good quality chocolate nestled inside. This is a very dense and rich cookie. Not my personal favorite, but my friend really enjoyed it!"", ""From day one with the first kouign amann, I already knew that I was in love. I've been here a few times since then, always for the kouign amanns -- all of the flavors are amazing! Though my favorite will always be the chocolate one. Others I've tried include the chocolate banana almond croissant, passionfruit bostock, and chocolate chip cookie. All of them were excellent!

Their ordering system is pretty straight forward: you wait in front of the pastries counter to order and then walk down the counter to pay. There is seating for parties of 2 all around the bakery and outdoors as well. It's a nice place to have a business casual meeting or just grab a bite to eat, but because of how noisy and delicious smelling it can get inside, I wouldn't recommend studying there. As this was my first time, I wanted to order their most popular pastry: Kouign Amann Nature (original) ($4.25). It was DELICIOUS. It looks hard at first but after taking the first bite, I find the outside to be a little crunchy, sweet, and flaky; and the inside is moist, soft, and sweet.

Now in business for herself since 2012, stints at Manresa and Pierre Herme laying the foundation for what will likely soon be a Beard Award-winning career, it is at the corner of California and Divisadero that patrons will find a collection of items sweet and savory, the counter wrapping an open kitchen offering more than a glimpse of processes streamlined to yield both volume and uncompromising quality.Carefully bridging French technique and American sensibilities, Leong and partner Michel Suas creating over two-dozen items daily, those in the know will first take time to peruse seasonal options before making choices, though those with a substantial appetite may just be better off starting left and working right at risk of ordering with eyes bigger than their stomachs.Opting for the latter approach, a total of nine Pastries tallying just over $40, it was finding a comfortable seat in the widow that indulgence was underway, bites of Madeline flecked by Sesame attesting to a keen sense of balance while the Carrot Bran Muffin was far less sweet than anticipated, yet still moist and saturated with Spices.Thrilled to see pint-size Kugelhopf, an Alsatian specialty here featuring California White Raisins suspended in Brioche baked golden, it was quickly finishing this that attention turned to a Cornmeal Scone riddled by Blueberries, the bite-to-bite textural variance an impressive feat, as too was the degree of lamination achieved by Pain Suisse that seems only painted with Custard to anchor the Chocolate Chips.Not about to pass on Kouign Amann, the very reason so many make their trip to Lower Pacific Heights, it was disccovering a combination of Pineapple Jam and shredded Coconut that this iteration took on a tropical tinge, the Apple Almond Croissant to follow unfortunately failing to compare since the bottom was quite soggy and corners overly sweet.Finishing with Cookies and Cake, the former layering Dark Chocolate Wafers in Butter, Flour and Sugar to achieve a texture not unlike Fudge, it is for $7 that guests can find even more richness in the form of Chocolate Caramel Toffee Mousse, the flourless Biscuit base doing a fine job of standing up to the bittersweet satin mound and shiny Ganache on top.', ""After getting brunch, my friends and I decided that we had to go to a second food stop because it was the end of spring break and we deserved a little something extra.

Food:- Chocolate Banana Almond Croissant--$4.50My favorite item we tried because it was still warm and freshly baked! There were actual slices of banana inside which I was so surprised and delighted about when I bit into it. Since it was still freshly baked, the banana slices were warm and creamy, and the chocolate inside was melted and gooey. This went so well with the flaky and buttery croissant.- Pineapple Coconut Kouign Amann--$4.75All of B. Patisserie's kouign amanns are so buttery and flaky and this was no exception. The bit of pineapple filling inside was sweet and sticky and was a refreshing addition to the delicate pastry.- Chocolate Kouign Amann--$4.75Lots of gooey decadent chocolate in this kouign amann made the delicious pastry on its own even better.- Passionfruit Bostock--$3.50This bostock had a fluffy tender crumb and was moist and soft. The passionfruit added sweetness and the little bits of almonds on top added a nice crunch. The bottom was slightly caramelized and hardened from crystallized sugar, which was satisfying to eat.Tips:- We arrived around 2:30 pm and there was still a great selection of kouign amanns, croissants, and other pastries!

Patisserie does an incredible job with its delicate texture and flavorful fillings. \xa0All said, B. Patisserie can be pricey but they're worth it."", ""I love this place! The bake goods at this place is crunchy in the right places and soft in the right places (is that okay to say here? Please don't flag me.) This place is known for their kouign amann's. This is a crunchy sugared pastry that sometimes have a delicious middle. I've had their regular one which is divine, as well as the dark chocolate one but the passion fruit one is definitely my favorite. Although the kouign amann's tend to be a star you definitely cannot overlook their chocolate chip cookies! It's amazing how the chocolate chip cookies melts in your mouth even when they aren't freshly baked. I also highly recommend their 10 hour baked apple tart and their banana chocolate croissants. Honestly you can get almost anything here and be absolutely happy with it. I highly recommend!"", ""Really love their pastries, the style is similar to Madison Kayser (France, NYC). My favorite is the banana chocolate croissant ($4.5)!! I've been here multiple times and it is aways my go to :)Cookies are quite good. That is if you like it crispy on the edges, but soft on the inside and more on the thin side. They go for $3.75 a piece.Not known for their chai lattes ($5). It's quite fragranced and has clear cardamom taste which I am not a fan of especially in large quantity. I like it when the spaces reaches a balance and doesn't overpower the other spices in the mix."", ""This is my favorite bakery in the Bay Area! So many good and tasty items here! Of course the kouign amann is a hit here. I prefer the original/natural version without the filling as you can taste more of the buttery goodness that way. Another favorite is the passion fruit bostock which I was told is a staff favorite. Their croissants are good too with the banana chocolate almond one being my favorite version. Their big chocolate chip cookies are also a hit. I like to bring mine home and reheat \xa0in the microwave a bit to get the chocolate a bit melted. Their cakes are ok too but I prefer their baked flaky items more. I read great comments about their apple tart which supposedly takes hours to bake. But I always get there too late for it and they are sold out. I plan to go there tomorrow morning so hopefully I get lucky and can finally score a few of the apple tarts...wish me luck!Update: so I just got here the next morning and scored some apple tarts finally! Very good! But still prefer the bostock and KM.

Firstly, I have to say they have free WiFi and comfortable place to work and study with enjoyable music. O man, today is the second day I came back to this cafe and had to order the same thing again because yesterday I fell in love with their fresh made vegetable \xa0juice. It's a recipe the owner learned that uses fresh ingredients to help our body, mind, and soul. So delicious as well! I had there latte as well which is really good and the best part is that it comes with a cheese pop up. Yum yum yum I also had their mushroom Gorgonzola empanada. I love mushrooms and the ingredients in the empanada is so flavorful. Lastly, I had good conversation with the owner here and she is very pleasant to talk to and very sweet. She even volunteers in India .... isn't that wonderful? Love love love"", 'Saltroot is my favorite go to place if I want Pao De Quejo! They make it fresh if I order for pick up.

Noticed they serve Intelligentsia coffee here. And you get a cheese pop free with a hot drink!I got the classic parmesan cheese pop (pao de queijo) with my coffee. It is not your traditional cheesy bread pop. It is made with cassava. The place also makes sliders out of the cheese pops. The empanadas section was quite interesting too. Good food overall and great service.', ""Yummy! \xa0Ordered from this spot & had it in my hand super fast. The sandwiches are delicious though I preferred the tomato and basil.

It's a great place to read or get some work done! This place has relaxing and upbeat music with and large inviting Windows. When I first walked in, I was pleasantly surprised that the heater was turned on. After sitting in here for 10 minutes, I had to take off my scar and then my jacket, wishing it was less warm as it became stuffy. Anyway...I'm a little disappointed they don't do chai lattes here, BUT the tea is good and it comes with a delicious popover! I chose the Parmesan one, found it to be so good that I ordered two more--one parm and one guava. They're slightly crispy/crunchy on the outside with a soft, gooey-like interior. The texture is quite pleasant. The parm one is cheesy and savory, so delicious! The guava one tastes like guava and is just the right amount of sweetness. It didn't have as much guava filling as some of the their pictures I saw though. Both are great with tea! \xa0I'll def be back for more tea and popovers!"", ""I came to this cafe with my sister and her friends on a Saturday morning and it was not busy at all. This is a small and intimate shop with limited seating so it's not ideal for big groups. I think a lot of people tend to grab and go rather than sit down so I think you would be able to find a place to seat if you plan to dine-in. The shop seems to be run by just one guy (at least when we were there), so the service can be a bit on the slower end, but the wait is not bad at all. My favorite part of this place is that they give you a FREE cheese puff with any hot drink purchases. This includes any of the coffees and teas but excludes the juices. There are a couple of different flavors for the cheese puffs that you can order in addition but the cheese puff that comes with the drink is the original one. I absolutely loved the texture of the cheese puffs. It reminded me of the mocha bread at Asian bakery sometimes since it's pretty chewy. My sister had ordered a guava cheese puffs with her orange juice, and I was a little surprised that the guava cheese puffs are still on the more savory side. The cheese flavor for these cheese puffs are pretty strong so they are on the savory end even if you order the sweeter flavors like guava. I had ordered the tea with turmeric and ginger because I was feeling a bit under the weather and it was pretty good. It was definitely on the lighter side but I just liked that they had the option that seemed to hit the spot for someone who wasn't feeling well. It was a great alternative to the coffee drinks.The menu was pretty simple, which I liked. They also have free wifi! I think this is a nice little cafe and would love to come back and try out the other cheese puff flavors."", 'Love the Brazilian pao cheese popovers in flavors including classic parmesean and unusual guava jam...and that they also sell them packaged and frozen in other flavors such as gorgonzola, onion & parsley and potato & mustard. I will definitely try the other flavors.', 'My friends and I took a field trip to the Legion of Honor museum one morning, and the best part was coming to Saltroot Cafe afterwards. The exhibit wasn\'t as thrilling as coming here to have a coffee and try their incredible food. It\'s a small and quaint cafe, but we managed to secure a table in the corner.Each beverage comes with a cheese pop-ups, which looks so simple but makes your taste buds explode with joy. It\'s dangerous that they sell these for taking home... I could sit in front of Netflix and snack on them forever. The empanadas are amazing, too. So fresh, flaky, and tasty.Everything about the experience at Saltroot Cafe is carefully crafted. It feels casual yet classy to be here. The combination of the furniture, decor, and presentation of coffee and pastries creates the perfect environment to relax and have a good conversation with friends. Or spend some ""me time"" one afternoon. One of the most memorable cafes in San Francisco, I\'d say!', ""Location- I was interested in this shop since I saw that they had the puffs. It's also a really covenient spot to go to since it has an OK amount of parking near the little tennis courts. Food- OMG the cheese and guava puffs are amazing!! I could not stop. I got the hot chocolate along with my puffs. Let me tell you, everything was pretty delicious. It's a great spot for a little before dinner, post dinner snack.Overall- It's a tiny spot, but I haven't had an issue finding a seat. The lady was also pretty nice. \xa0It's also a nice place to get some work done. I'd come back, especially for the puffs."", ""We were just looking for wifi. We found it, and also discovered the amazing cheese pops, or puffs, or whatever these balls of deliciousness are called. The food menu is not extensive, but definitely some tasty looking options, including four kinds of empanadas. I got the green juice, which was legit cold press with the usual suspects, plus two of the cheese puffs as an afterthought. They were hot and airy and chewy. How have I gotten this far in life without having experienced their magnificence before?!I was doing a crammed work session with a friend and working from a laptop, taking advantage of their speedy free WiFi. We knew from the hours listed that the cafe was closing soon, but were trying to crank through some problems. The woman working was soooo nice about it. She brought over two cheese puffs on the house, and very politely said, just to give you a heads up, we will be closing soon. We were there a few minutes after official closing, but she was very nice about it. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the hood--nice place to stop for a snack after a Legion of Honor visit."", 'This was a happy discovery after the walk in Lands End and China Beach.A cute little cafe with great choice of tea cups and relaxing atmosphere.

Blue Bottle Coffee,"[""Blue Bottle Coffee is what I hope to find in an urban coffee shop buried in San Francisco's South Of Market district. Turns out, Blue Bottle is a local chain, started in Oakland, now sprawling the globe with over 50 locations. Despite the mold, the store we walked into provided a first-time experience for us.The atmosphere is up-cycled industrial conversion, occupying a first floor corner space in an office building on Mint Plaza that reeks of story. The line for service was literally out the door when we walked up on a typically sunny, temperate San Fran Saturday morning. Always on the hunt for something new, we ordered New Orleans Cold Brew, a swirly mixture of milk and dark and smooth cold brew that was robust without being bitter. We both normally want to sweeten our coffee. But this brew was just so good, we didn't want to alter it in any way. We also tried a Siphon Coffee, something I'd never heard of. Apparently, it uses a Japanese-manufactured device that happened to be set up directly in front of where we sat. They heat the coffee to a specific temperature and brew it directly in the water in a flask straight from high school chemistry lab without a filter, skimming the grounds when they pour it out (see my pix). It's served in a beaker with cold water to clear the pallet between sips. I don't know how different it really was (I'm a bit too hoi polloi to perceive the distinction). But, it was fun and unusual. The barista who made it for us was informative and kind enough to answer all my Siphon-newb questions.We also ordered Avocado Toast, which was exceptional. But, center stage was the coffee. High marks for service, experience, atmosphere, quality, and variety. If there was a Blue Bottle near me, I'd hit it all the time. Highly recommended!"", 'Blue Bottle Coffee itself I\'d give 4 stars, but this specific location has its faults.There\'s a certain price I\'m willing to pay for my daily cup of joe. $4.50 for a latte is comfortable. $5 is ""I\'m not coming here everyday"" territory. Slap on that ""Healthy SF Surcharge"" and that $5 is now $5.20. Ok fine, 20 cents; I\'ve already decided I\'m not coming here every day but I\'m fine contributing to these nice employees\' healthcare costs. HOWEVER, ONLY THIS LOCATION ALSO CHARGES SF SALES TAX. So now that $5 latte is $5.62 and this officially became ""I\'m only coming here because I\'m desperate and it\'s the nearest coffee shop and/or everywhere else is already closed.""There is no fucking way I\'m paying $5.62 for a latte every day, especially when there are so many other great options available in this neighborhood. SF is spoiled when it comes to excellent, locally roasted coffee, but this particular section of SoMa is as dense as it gets for top notch coffee options. Sightglass Coffee, Four Barrel at Pentacle Coffee, and Saint Frank are all within a few blocks radius for my daily, within-my-comfort zone fix. East SoMa may have all the new high rises, but you best believe West SoMa is coffee mecca.If you\'re not coming here every day and just want to check out the location, there a few cool perks (I know, complete mood switch lol):-17ft Ceiling Espresso - Most Blue Bottle locations serve their Hayes Valley Espresso by default. This location serves a special blend named after the specs of this Mint Plaza building. It\'s a subtle, delicious change especially if you drink Blue Bottle so often that you\'re almost toooo accustomed to the taste-Siphon Bar - At $8/$14, this is definitely not a daily cup of coffee thing lol. But if you\'re a coffee aficionado and appreciate the unique methods you can extract a lovely brew then this is something you definitely gotta try. Once(?) they had an extra special single origin coffee from Yemen for $20 so if you\'re really a bean seeker keep your eyes peeled. Only available between 8AM-2PM.-Nel drip - Blue Bottle has their own custom dripper that they use for most pour-overs, but they also do Nel drips for $10. This cool contraption produces an interesting, more viscous brew. Only 3oz so treat yo self.All things considered, I still come here but not as often \xa0as I could because I drink way too much coffee and have to budget or else I\'d be living wrecklessly. The staff is extra friendly, the location is set in a historic plaza, and coffee lovers can swoon over the offerings here.', 'Great coffee; smooth lattes.Avocado toast is okay. Idk what the hype is about. Always a line so it takes about 15 minutes to get your coffee.They just changed to paper straws idk why.... I thought their blue straw was a signature mark that I loved having bc it was so unique!!!!!!!!', ""I was visiting SF for a week and I had to try this place out. I've heard of the brand and the 1000+ positive reviews sold it for me. When I got there, the line was out of the door and took about 10 minutes to pass through, so don't be intimidated by it. I got a Japanese style drip coffee. It was very thick and rich cold brew. It was intense but still drinkable. It was very very good and if it was affordable and living there I would definitely drink this every StaurdayI also got a Tahini cookie. Unfortunately I did not really enjoy the tahini cookie. It was too sweet and a little mealy"", 'Yummy new orleans coffee. Came as expected. Good treat.', ""This location is a little tucked away from the busy bustle of Powell and Market. I usually meet people around Powell when I get off BART, so when I'm early, I like to pop in here to grab a cup of coffee while I wait for my friends. Most recently I had their cappuccino with oat milk (offered, but not shown on the menu), and it was perfection. Staff are always so friendly here!"", ""Pretty bougie place but the hype isn't letting me down. I only ever came here twice and I had the same order, an iced mocha but the second time around I tried it with almond milk and I actually quite prefer it. Although it's an extra dollar, it was worth it because my lactose intolerant a$$ would have never forgiven me if I had gotten the courage to ingest actual f**king dairy. I also had a couple pastries and they were definitely tasty. One was the blonde mini corn bread (I think that's what it was \u200d) and the rose flavored pastry. Very aromatic but wasn't entirely my cup of paste-tea-ree (har har). Would totally come here again.pretty low-key location too and it's next to a couple dispensaries if that's anything worth adding lol"", ""I love trying new coffee places so we had to stop by when we were in the area. Look for the blue bottle since the name isn't outside and could be easily passed up. The line went pretty quick and the cashier was nice. I ordered the mocha and it was pretty sweet but good. Strong coffee but not over whelming. Not really any food options besides pastries. They have a bathroom that you need a code for so ask an employee if you need it."", ""I dare say this may be the best cup of coffee I've ever had.I was staying at the Marriott around the block and I decided to I come here before my work day begun around 8ish. I arrived to find line around the corner. Thankfully, it went quick and I was in and out within 15 minutes. I ordered the original cold brew with a bit of almond milk. After slurping it down I was decided I'd have to I return the next day and order a hot coffee. The following day I went with the caffe latte added almond milk and a bit of sugar. Oh man was I in heaven. As I walked back to work I couldn't help but wonder if I'll ever taste coffee as good as this. In that moment, nothing has or ever will stack up to Blue Bottle Coffee."", 'Came by for coffee the other day and it was a phenomenal experience! Tucked away South of Market, there is plenty of staff to assist!The Mocha here is excellent! Espresso is very smooth, the foam is excellent, latte art is perfect, and milk temperature is perfect! They do take contactless payment, like Google Pay, and have complimentary Blue Bottle buttons too!Parking around this area is pretty much non-existent! Service by the staff is always excellent!There is a 4% healthy SF surcharge on all orders!', 'Nice, rich coffee. It came quick and there were enough seats for my family. My only nitpick was that the coffee was pretty lukewarm.', 'This was a cute little coffee shop that has great drip coffee. I ordered the Brazil coffee and it was nice and strong. There was a line out the door when we arrived and I had to wait 5-10 minutes after I ordered to get my coffee.', ""Was in SF for the weekend and had to try the infamous Blue Bottle Coffee! This one is nestled away, kind of hard to find and we had to drive past some pretty sketchy looking areas to get there. There was a little bit of a line but it went relatively quick. I just had an americano which was very good! You can tell from watching that the baristas take a lot of pride and care in how they prepare the drinks. They're not slinging drinks around or rushing to get them out but not slow as molasses either. The breakfast menu was limited but it looked like they had some good options. I would definitely be interested to try another location next time I'm in the city!"", 'The best coffee I had in SFO, I roast my own beans so I am a bit picky on coffee, their pour over coffee met my expectation from every aspect! Absolutely 5/5! I also tried avocado toast, was not bad 3.5/5. The service is excellent considering they are so packed and busy!', ""Without fail, this Blue Bottle is always busy when I visit--which I think is a testament to how popular this coffee chain remains. Located in Mint Plaza, it is a relatively small cafe compared to their other sites. The volume of customers in a narrow space also makes it a cacophonous experience; if you are looking for a quiet place to chat or work, this place is NOT it. However, I've never been disappointed by the coffee quality, and the service is generally friendly and welcoming despite the long lines. If you are ordering an espresso-based drink, be prepared to wait for a bit if you are visiting during peak times. You can also sit in the nearby plaza if the cafe's tables are occupied. If shopping at the Westfield Mall has you feeling sleepy, this Blue Bottle is great for a pick-me-up or a small snack."", ""I was visiting SF 2 weeks ago and came here for breakfast with my gf and her daughter; our experience was great. The place was easy to spot because it was very packed and the line went all the way around it. I got in the line while my gf and her daughter saved us a place to sit. My gf had the avocado toast w/ poached egg, which was great; the dish was fresh and tasty. I had the Belgian waffle w/ poached eggs, which was a delicious mix of sweet and savory. My gf's had the Belgian waffle w/ bacon, which was also very tasty. We also had some warm and fresh coffees and hot chocolate. The service was good and the ambiance nice. I don't usually go to coffee shops back home, but SF really knows how to do them. Also, much like everything else worth having here in SF, you will have to wait, so bring your patience. Other than that, I would recommend this place and look forward to returning."", ""If I could give this place 7 stars, I would! This particular location was 10 mins walking distance from our hotel and I had never had a chance to go to blue bottle when I lived in NYC. We decided to grab an early breakfast here. \xa0While walking to it, the area seemed a little sketchy but we didn't feel unsafe. I got the cappuccino with their house made oat milk which \xa0was recommended by Valerie (our cashier), the avocado toast and some type of sweet oat bread.I told Valerie how it was my first time at blue bottle and how I have always wanted to try it. She was so nice about it and gave us our drinks complimentary as a gesture of appreciation for trying them out!Customer service overall was stellar and so was the taste of food and drinks. Definitely going back!Thank you Valerie for making taking our experience to the next level!"", ""Best Mocha I've ever had! So rich in coffee taste and very lightly sweetened. The chocolate flavor was strong but not to the point that it overwhelmed the coffee. They blended in just perfectly. I also tried their New Orleans latte with almond milk and man what a good combo they made! I like how when they hand the drinks out to the customers, they don't include the lids, which kinda makes the drinks look a bit like an alcohol drink, which also could save some lids for the environment! All the Blue Bottle coffee drinks have this very signature taste that other places don't have, which has a light hint of salt and cream after taste, really unique! Love the busy and sociable ambience at the store too. You should come and try that for yourself."", ""Makes my top 3 coffee spots in SF!It is on the corner of an alley way that bends; there's like two parking spots right outside, but they're often taken by people who work next door. Across the street, there's a huge parking structure you can pay for. Many types of public transport also converge around this part of downtown. It's very, very hip! Tall ceilings, bar seating, and a couple cute tables line the exterior. Their drip coffee is made to order, using a single funnel. It's on the smaller side, so I wouldn't come here to do work with a group. I'm pretty sure I made myself a WiFi hot spot too. Every single one of their pastries is DELICIOUS and pair beautifully with the bitter coffee. Their coffee is extremely caffeinated, the way it should be. I came in during this afternoon this time and ordered an affogato for the first time, along with some baked goods because I couldn't resist. The ice cream was walnut cream and surrendered nicely to the espresso notes. Will definitely return for coffee if I have an early morning in this area!"", ""I really love BB coffee and try to have it as often as possible.After a long day of touring the city I needed caffeine and I needed it bad. The wifey and I had stopped in to grab some ice cream and I realized that coffee and ice cream may actually snap me out of how exhausted I was.I opted for the New Orleans coffee. Wow. I learned I do not like chicory. No downgrade to them - I should stick with what I know and not branch out. I sucked it down anyways because I needed the jolt. The average stars is the location. I felt like the customer service was meh at best and the line took quite while. I assumed a location used to a tourism influx would handle the pressure of a line a tad better and more efficiently.Thanks for the coffee - it did its job. I'll stick to ordering my normal.

Bernie’s,"['Very nice quaint coffee shop with friendly baristas. Good prices for the drinks too. I had the honey hazelnut latte and it was great. The milk was steamed to perfection and the foam was so nice and light. They have many tables and free WiFi. Dog friendly as well!', ""I want to love Bernie's as much as everyone in this neighborhood but I feel like it's a hit or miss with their Hazelnut Latte. I feel like everyone who works here makes it different and some make it great. I don't know but I feel like every time I try this either iced or hot, it's made differently every time.I love how many older gentleman sit outside on a sunny day to enjoy their coffee and how it's filled with a more older crowd than the Starbucks younger crowd. It makes me wonder why they enjoy this place so much and what they order. I also don't like how they charge so much for an alternative milk and how the hazelnut price went up as well. When I first tried it, it was in the $5 dollar range but it is in the $6-$7 dollar range with subbing the milk. That's my only compliant. I haven't tried any other drink from them but there is a lot of hype for this hazelnut latte. Sometimes the people on the bar are nice and sometimes they seem rude."", 'Headed here for the afternoon to work -- found a spot easily, while enjoying a great cappuccino.', ""I had a terrible cappuccino from here the other week. It was in a to go cup and I'm not kidding you when I picked up the cup it felt like there was nothing in it. It was mainly just foam in the entire cup and when you got to the coffee it was watered down and bitter. The customer service was nice but they must have just really screwed up my cappuccino. Maybe just get something else if you come here."", 'If you truly like good coffee this is the place to go in the neighborhood. Definitely avoid the overly sweet beverages from the Starbucks across the street!', ""I ordered an almond milk latte with a spinach and feta french pastry. It came up to a little less than $10. Service was spectacular! The cashier was super nice and friendly--something you don't always get at sf coffee shops. The latte was good and the pastry was also good. Neither blew me out of the water, but overall, I had a good experience. If you're able to nab a table by the window on a sunny day it is the perfect spot to get some work done!"", 'This is a true community-focused cafe. You\'re treated as an individual, with an abundance of kindness, not as a bother or with attitude that so many ""hip"" cafes often serve.

Bernie insisted on making my latte and giving me the croissant, saying, ""This is my cafe. You have to have breakfast. Pay me back later."" There\'s no way the nearby Starbucks or La Boulangerie, who Bernie\'s competes with, would have had the same response! \xa0I went back as soon as possible to pay her back, and I now go out of my way to stop there, because it\'s so important to support a local business with such heart and generosity.', ""The ambience is great and the service is fine. It's a great place to study. However my cappuccino was all foam. Seemed like the barista tried to fill the to-go cup with foam on top of the espresso shot...a true cappuccino is better proportioned than that and won't fill a typical to-go cup. Also, they have for-here dishware and didn't ask us if we'd be staying."", 'Such a lovely place--friendly staff, delicious pastry, and relaxed ambience. Maddeningly, I realized I forgot my wallet as soon as I walked in the door. The barista (owner?) told me I could pay my tab next time. It was such a friendly gesture, especially since I\'d never stopped in before. (FYI, they also accept Apple Pay.) She seemed equally nice to everyone else who walked through the door--I definitely got the ""small town coffee shop"" vibe, where everyone knew and liked each other. I had a small spinach quiche, which was pretty yummy. And the staff were pretty cool about letting me chill at one of the worktables for an hour. They even have a free phone charging station and WiFi. If I lived closer, I would definitely make this my go-to spot.', ""Bernies is an adorable and warm coffee shop in the delightful Noe Valley.

Ritual Coffee Roasters,"[""Visited last Sunday while I was checking out Mission district for the first time (it's semi-crazy how it is my first) but wanted to visit this place since I drink coffee like water. Disclaimer: I cannot really take strong coffee - even for americano, I always order as single shot or ask to put extra extra water to the drink so that it is more water downed and diluted. It is simply because of taste that I cannot take rather than caffeine.I ordered cold brew recommended by a staff and as a person who does not drink cold brew normally as I wrote above for my liking for coffee- I gotta say I really enjoyed it. It did not have sour taste which I commonly find in cold brew from starbucks and anywhere else but the ambience was hip and cute. Would definitely comeback when my second visit to Mission happens ;)"", ""This place is very cute spacious and comfy. \xa0Plenty of seating with two individual bathroom stalls. \xa0Back of the cafe has a large window with tropical plants making it appear a bit less city-busy. \xa0Coffee of course is great and their tea is delightfully served in a clay pot on a wooden tray. There's of course pastries, mostly if the sweet kinds, but a vegan sausage croissant roll as well. I was tempted, but I didn't dig in. For the healthier eaters, there's housemade granola with Chobani Greek yogurt. \xa0Outlets along one of the walls for those laptop users but expect to tether your own. \xa0Don't forget the coffee card, buy 10 get 1 free, Apple Pay and great service."", ""Nice ambiance and amount of seating. The light colored wood, high ceilings, and clean decor makes it trendy and calm. The place was kind of noisy, mostly because it's echoey, so if you're looking for a quiet place to work it may not be the place for you. It's a nice place for socializing and grabbing coffee with friends. My main complaint is the price. I got the Dandelion Mocha which was $6.25. It was a good mocha and I appreciate the local touch but I did feel a little guilty spending $6.25 on a drink, but I guess that's the cost of coffee in SF."", ""What I had: Iced chai with almond milkVisit date: February 18, 2019First time? Yes.This place gets crowded! On my visit there was a line - it goes by fairly quickly and my drink wait time was about 10 minutes. It was a Monday holiday so not sure if this is the normal scene. There's lots of seating, but again, there were lots of people, so it's one of those 'jump on the table as soon as people get up' situations.I had an iced chai 'for here.' They serve the for here orders in glass/ceramic ware. My drink was nice and creamy, just a touch sweet. It was perfectly refreshing. The atmosphere is on the louder side, but there were also a number of people doing work on laptops - the lighting is nice for it."", ""Came here with a couple of friends on a Sunday evening. Found parking easily on the street. The place has good ambience inside, decent seating and clean restroom. Husband got a cappuccino but it was served lukewarm. When we asked the barista to make it hot, he said cappuccino is supposed to be served warm, which I didn't think was right. Anyway he got us a new one which was better than before but still not hot. I didn't want to ask a second time so left it as is."", ""They have oat milk! I live nearby and this is my favorite spot to get an oat milk latte. They have great pastries as well - an assortment of croissants, scones, and vegan donuts. It's probably not the best spot if you're looking to get work done as it gets pretty loud, especially on the weekends. The line can also get very long on the weekends, sometimes almost out the door. But the coffee is great!"", 'Had a great cappuccino here on my first stop of delicious coffee spots in SF. Cute space with friendly staff. The line was out the front door but moved quickly.', ""I typically love Ritual, but there's a couple things that knock this down to a 4-star establishment instead of a 5-star. First off, I do appreciate how clean and simply decorated/open this coffee shop is. It feels airy and not stuffy/cramped like a lot of coffee shops do. The people behind the register are typically incredibly friendly (s/o to Kendall). I came this morning around 8:30am and they were out of chocolate for the dandelion chocolate mocha (which is essentially the only reason I come here). They also have very limited seating (it's usually taken) and no WiFi. Parking can be pretty tough, and the outdoor seating area is also very limited. So, I usually come here before work and get my coffee to go before making the 1.5 hour commute down to San Jose. If you like dependably good quality coffee and just want it to go (you don't need a place to sit down in work) or you loveeee mocha's, I'd recommend this place."", ""Good hipster coffee. Came by with a group of friends after eating an early dinner to get some caffeine to explore SF. I got a regular drip coffee which was strong and a bit acidic. My fiance got the cold brew which was really good. Strong and bold, but not too acidic. Service was good. Seating available, but wouldn't recommend this place to get work done (unless you have noise canceling headphones or something) as theres lots of people coming in and out and people who were seated were mainly chatting with friends."", ""3.5 starsTL;DR1. Good coffee (iced lattes were yum!)2. Crazy prices (two iced lattes were $10... sorry, what?!)3. Cute interior (big, bright, airy, modern)4. It was very cold, though (they keep the doors open on both ends of the cafe)5. Bathroom was a mess (Like, second/triple/quadruple-guess how much you actually have to go, messy and gross.)Gave a three as I doubt I'd return. There are too many awesome coffee shops to settle on a mediocre one - sorry!"", ""Pros: the coffee, the service, the pastries, holy cow a coffee shop that doesn't close at 5p in SFCons: SF + good coffee = overpriced Finding a good coffee shop in SF that stays open past sunset is more frustrating then being delayed at the airport. For some reason, it is really really hard to find ANY open coffee shop in 90% of the city after 530p. Yet another sign that SF is not really ready to be considered a primetime major city worth it's rep...but I digress. This all makes Ritual really stand out to me. First it's open until 8 everyday(!!). Second, the coffee is good. Really good. This is the perfect place to buy a distinctly SF gift for your F&F. I would say the coffee is usually more tasty and not as brutally strong as sightglass, and more refined than Philz. Service is friendly and quick. In true SF fashion, you can encounter long lines on weekend mornings but otherwise it's usually very reasonable. You can also expect a very reasonable selection of pastries and on a sunny day there is cool outdoor seating. Indoor seating is \xa0plentiful and offers numerous work spaces. Like all cafes in SF, using the bathroom can be adventurous bc of the homeless problem but it is available. Caveats? I have no idea how WiFi works here bc I don't trust/do public WiFi (use at your own risk). Paying $5 for coffee is also frankly not sustainable for most folks. Refills? Overall: highly recommended (but please don't crowd me out on Sunday morning ok?)"", ""First time here on Valencia, nice open space, cool art for sale and simple menu. Pros: * Easy access, and outdoor wooden seating * dog friendly * clean and organized * spacious * iced latte = really smooth, shot extracted to perfection * cafe macchiato = too astringent, shot not extracted properly, or not calibrated recently Cons:* on a Sunday morning, I would expect some enthusiasm from the baristas! This was not the case of a single employee working. Drink a shot, or two! Wake up and smell the beans! Smile- it won't hurt. *street parking only, and not a lot of it*beans are very expensive! 3/5 stars due to poor customer service, and a sub par macchiato."", ""The deco and space are stunning but I question the quality of the coffee. I wanted to get a latte but the selection is from the espresso list. One of the three features a single origin coffee from Brazil. I was quite surprised. Brazil beans are not well known for its quality because of the low latitude and also the overall strategy emphasizing on quantity over quality. Honestly, I have never seen a single coffee shop featuring Brazilian single origin beans. So instead, I got a brew called Hambela Gotiti since usually a pour over is always going to be better than espresso. The Hambela Gotiti was average though. Ethiopia beans are well known for their nice acidity and floral and fruity notes like written on the menu like blueberry and lilac. But the roast of the beans pretty much killed the notes. I had to pour milk in it for me to keep drinking it. What is interesting though, is that the coffee tastes a little better on my way back because the temperature goes down a bit. That is when I can taste the notes a bit more. But after it cools down even more, it does not taste good anymore. Anyways, like the vibe but don't come for the actual coffee. Not worth your money."", ""nice place for coffee in mission district as it's a big open space with a modern and clean atmosphere. the light fixtures are unique and a cool touch to the place. i wish they had flavors for coffee like a vanilla latte for example, but the coffee was still good nonetheless. I've definitely had better, but I still enjoyed it. Service was ok."", ""They've renovated this flagship Ritual outlet since my first review and visit here many years ago, with the result being that it's a more airy, modern-feeling space that can accommodate more seated customers at a variety of spaces, whether counters in the front and middle or small tables in the rear.Thanks to its reasonably long hours (open until 8pm daily), it's still a dependable go-to for me while in the Valencia corridor. The coffee is as good as it's always been. While there's no wi-fi and few (if any) power outlets, there are still just as many, if not more, laptop loiterers as before. It's a productive place for a meeting, conversation, or a quick work session on your laptop."", ""A trendy eye-appeal space for a good cup of coffee.Their $5.00 latte is in-line with other upscale trendy spaces in this gentrified neighborhood. .The Baristas were very kind to me and even called out my name so I could hear it when my coffee was ready, thank you. .The neon lights, especially the one over the bar is very appealing yet there are too few spaces to sit in such a vast interior space. There is a wall bar one can stand up against yet no stools to sit down on. There are far too few tables yet the space is clean and the coffee quite good.

Reason being is that this was their very first location that opened its doors back in 2005. Since then, they now have a total of 6 coffee shops; 5 in San Francisco and 1 in Napa. Located in the heart of the Mission District directly on Valencia St. (in between 21st and 22nd St\'s), many people who have never been here before may not even realize the business is here. Their trademark is a red flag resembling a star and an outline of what looks like a coffee cup. My lady and I arrived roughly around 10:30am on a beautiful Saturday morning. Since we drove here, we luckily found parking right outside the business! Do keep in mind that this is metered parking which the city charges Monday through Saturday.Upon entering, the building itself has a long rectangular shape to it. From an aesthetics perspective, it is very spacious, inviting, and bright. And with the light earth tone colored walls throughout, it allows an abundance of natural light inside. There are a few select prints along the walls and area to purchase their coffee beans, coffee mugs, high-end espresso machines, and even books. This is an example of one of many coffee houses that almost has the look and feel of an art gallery.Ritual offers a simplistic yet effective menu of options. Everything from basic brewed coffee to drinks that are used with the Hario V60 dripper. And of course your basic espresso drinks including cappuccinos, macchiatos, lattes, and mochas. They also offer a nice little tea selection as well as hot chocolate and Chai lattes. There is a pastry selection including croissants, muffins, and scones but the choices are quite limited.As far as our drinks, I ended up ordering a 16 oz. Cold Brew w/cream while she opted for their \'hot\' Latte w/vanilla syrup added (available at the condiment station). We also split a blueberry vanilla scone to share. Both our drinks come out within a minute of another as we both grabbed a seat inside by the window. My drink packed a nice punch as I loved the bitterness and strength of their coffee. Her latte was very creamy, frothy, and sweet while the espresso flavor was on point. Overall, we were both very impressed with the delicate process of making their coffee drinks at ""Ritual Coffee Roasters"". The reason why I am deducting a star from this place is that there is no Wi-Fi! C\'mon guys, your business is one of the major tech cities in the world, at least let us connect online! Another is that their are no power outlets for charging your phone/tablet/laptop. And finally, the prices are a bit steep but keep in mind, this is San Francisco when everything is at a premium. Aside from those little negatives, I still highly recommend this place for the avid coffee drinker. My rating, four solid stars.', ""Well, the coffee was decent.

Before ordering, I was allowed to same each different brew and decide which one I wanted in my drink. I had never tasted a soymilk based drink so smooth or clean-tasting in my life. Normally soy makes a pretty obvious substitution for milk, but this time I really enjoyed the slightly nutty flavor that it gave off. The pastries also looked excellent; my friends ordered an almond croissant and a lemon muffin which I nibbled off of. Both were decent.

Well, Jamie W. and I were back at Spike's after a long absence just because I was looking to have some hot liquid in my body after a brisk walk over the Swish Alps. It's still the same tiny place on 19th Street, but we take up less room so it didn't seem as claustrophobic on this visit. The service was pleasant enough but didn't seem that outstanding. Maybe I've gotten more crotchety over the years. I can cop to that. Get off my lawn!However, I did like the montage of dog photos which we stared at from the round table next to the front window (photo: bit.ly/2EwLqwY). This time, we took advantage of their robust tea selection (photo: bit.ly/2F9zMW6) and decided on a steeping $2.50 cup of Rooibos (photo: bit.ly/2C2YfNT). Jamie, never a fan of hot liquids, went with the $3 Ginger Peach Iced Tea. They offer all sorts of gummy candies, but we were good and stuck with our teas.

There is a decent sized outside patio with tables and seating but on a beautiful sunny day like today, everything was taken up. All the way at the back of the shop is where you order. There is one cashier and one barista. Once you place your order, there's hardly any space to even stand to wait for your order without blocking the cream counter and trash cans. However, they work quickly to get you your drink so it's not too bad. You can have any hot drink iced for extra $0.50.

For example, a matcha latte with oat milk (yes they have Oatly!!!) sets me back ~$7 with tax and tip. Drip coffee is more affordable, at $3-$4. They also have pastries here from Third Culture bakery!

I believe they use Linea for their espresso, Verve for their drip and pour over, with a rotating third option featuring yet another roaster. Very cool.We ordered an oat milk decaf cappuccino, regular cappuccino, and matcha custard cake (they have a selection of tasty treats from Third Culture Bakery to enjoy with your coffee). Heads up! For those who are looking for milk alternatives, they don't serve soy milk here. They carry almond milk or oat milk, however.On a personal note, I really appreciate the company's attentiveness to customer experiences. I provided some feedback through the Square email receipt, and promptly received personalized follow up messages from the owner, addressing my concerns. Despite my criticisms, the owner replied with professionalism and hospitality - I wasn't expecting it, but I appreciated the conversation.

I took a Lyft to Haight Street and got to this coffee shop too early. Note: It opens at 7am not 6:30am. So I had no idea what I should get. I asked for something on the menu and they did not have it. So then I chose ""Gakoma,"" which sounds like ""glaucoma,"" the eye disease. It was an overpriced coffee after all at $4. I asked for some milk and I didn\'t know where it was...then I wanted soy milk and I got it from the counter dude. I was lost in my experience today. The menu is confusing and eccentric. They don\'t have the ""cherry bomb"" like in the Castro. I didn\'t even see chai on the menu...so the menu is different at different Ritual Coffee shops.

It was a perfect tourist detour to drink and recharge before heading to Haight and Ashbury.1. One locked restroom is available upon request2. Many tables, a window seated corner with red cylinders. At first look, thought were seats but, what I actually realized were tables.3. I only spotted one outlet to charge a mobile device.4. Order then pay. I was sort of confused on how the payment worked.

You can still get your fix with the included benefit of easier to find parking. I tried many a drinks here, I find their espresso to be more on the acidic palette, but it's rarely detected when consuming say a cappuccino or a latte. Their coffee has great body and mouth feel, but the notes and acidity aren't for the faint of heart. They take their coffee seriously and it does show through what they produce. Another note, your coffee will never taste the same come the new season...for they have seasonal espresso blends come in every season change. They have sometimes circulated previous espresso blends, but in other cases (i.e. Teen Age Riot, Acid Test) are special on occasion or temporal exceptions. Meaning they make blends in compliment to whatever season it is as well (i.e. Cabin Fever in Winter).

Also, it would be nice too if some of the baristas didn\'t try to ring up customers as quickly as possible.... Ironically, they often they treat older customers with more respect, attention, and patience. It is unfortunate, because I have plenty of younger friends who would have enjoyed coming here FOR THE COFEE.

Fresh ingredients although I could've done without the lettuce seemed a bit on the wilty side. Friendly service. One note a guy maybe the manager/ owner was there at the front register abruptly told the other person behind counter to take over and didn't communicate to me at all what was happening but stood behind the counter drinking coffee. I thought this was unusual. I have been in the restaurant industry and always take care of our customers first. However I will come back to try the adult beverages and small bites. To be continued..."", ""Minimum $5 charge for credit cardSuch a cute coffee spot. It's small and cozy, but great for catching up with a friend in a relaxing atmosphere. There's plenty of natural light, chairs are pretty comfortable, and there is also outdoor seating.

Sometimes I need a nice, sit-down with a warm cup of coffee in a mug. This ain't your Peet's or Starbucks. The last time I went was actually pretty chill and easy going. Very quiet. I had two cups of coffee. One pour-over, and one 16oz Café Au Lait. I loved both. They also have iced coffee if you're into that sort of thing. Cold brew is also available. Does anyone remember when Starbucks served alcohol? I think this place has been doing it before it became cool. They have a good selection of local brews. I say local because I noticed Anchor Steam and Fort Point KSA on the chalkboard menus. Both these beers, iirc are in SF, the latter coming out of the Presidio. Anyway, I guess I found my new favorite place to sit down and have a coffee... No. Enjoy a coffee the way it's supposed to be."", ""Super tiny but charming spot, it reminds me of Haight & Ashbury Street hipster rather than this part of town.

It's good to grab and go or coming in on off-peak hours. Good Soy Latte, good fresh juice/veggies, very nice cashier.$2 PAID WiFi which they gave you 2 hrs of WiFi, it was super SLOW & SPOTTY.

Better options in this hood for sure."", 'I\'ve never written a Yelp review. Even though I signed up years ago. This is my first. But today I was inspired. Really inspired. Not by the coffee or the tea, or the food - but by a girl (woman). I\'m what you call a ""die hard, old school romantic"". I always have been. You can thank my Southern grandfather. And this post might not even make it to the review section. But I met the most beautiful woman here today standing in line, with an equally beautiful and engaging personality. Skin dark, brown and smooth and fine like silk. And yes, She was ""Fine"". And when she smiled it was as if there was no-one else here. Her skin and smile - flawless. She was dressed very casually. Like you would on a Saturday afternoon in the bay when your running errands. We engaged in some very small talk while in line. And for whatever reason, I was not my normal cool self. This woman had me stuttering. Yep. I was nervous. After the small talk we sat down on separate sides of the coffee shop. And I couldn\'t help but look at her and think how do I get over to her and introduce myself, after all - she was eating her meal and reading a book and I didn\'t want to intrude. SO I decided to write her a handwritten note. Yep, told you I was an old school romantic. Now, how was I going to deliver it? Well, after about 30 minutes she got up and walked by me - I said ""excuse me"". And from there I engaged her in more conversation - however, this time there was more depth to it. She is smart, witty, and maybe even appreciated my goofy nerdyness. I handed her the letter. She smiled. and she said ""I will read it later"". She could of left after that - but she didn\'t. She stayed another 5 or 10 minutes. \xa0Good sign? I guess. In the letter, I left my cell and email. Now I wait. For love? A new friend? who knows.So if I must leave a review for the Blue Danube here it is. The green tea tasted like an elixir of love. Magical. (yeah, I\'m corny too, I know). Because when I was talking to her, anything I drank here would be magical. I love the chill atmosphere because it made it easy for me to engage her in a conversation. And to top it all off today the music playlist was classic rock from the 70s!!! the soundtrack of my childhood. I\'ve been here 4 hours and I\'ve heard The Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, Carly Simon, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Boston, ya feeling me yet? All the classics! The music that got me started playing guitar and the music that I play to this day - Still, everyday. It was just incredible all the way around. These are the type of cafes I miss living in Detroit now. Cool, chill neighborhood joints. And we are across from one of San Francisco\'s Iconic restaurants. Burma Superstar. The staff here was super cool. Hey, maybe its just the ""love bug"" LOL! Cause everything about this place was what you expect from a great local coffee shop. I saw a few complaints about the WiFi and the $2 cost. I get it. We all want and expect free WiFi while sipping our lattes and green teas. I have a personal hotspot on my phone for occasions like this. Everyone doesn\'t. So thank you Blue Danube. I came here by accident today, but did I really? Is there such a thing as an accident? I met a beautiful woman here today who I may or may not ever hear from again. But you made it a magical experience and allowed me to release my inner romantic.', ""On a cold blustery SF afternoon I wanted nothing else but a warm drink to hug me close until I could get back home. And so, I poked into Blue Danube seeing it was bustling with people and ordered myself a cappuccino to go.My drink was delivered quick and I thought it was pretty good for a to go cappuccino. Foam held strong and espresso wasn't too bitter. Drink was delivered piping hot which was also excellent as I continued along inner richmond.My only gripe, if anything, was the lack of room to maneuver inside. There was hardly any standing room while I waited for my drink. All available tables were taken so I had to stand awkwardly in the hallway which was full of employees trying to go back and forth."", ""Come here to chill with friends. It's definitely a cute place to hang out. Not so great if you want to use their wifi. There is no free wifi at this coffee house. I came here to work one day, and I did enjoy the atmosphere. Although, it could get distracting when it gets crowded or if you're facing the street, since it's on Clement where there's always pedestrians and cars going by. Since it was later in the day, I wasn't in the mood for coffee. I was however hungry so I ordered their quesadilla. Their quesadilla was alright. I mean, who can mess up a tortilla with just cheese filling?

Blue Bottle Coffee,"['I picked this place for coffee based on other reviews, and I\'m so glad I did! I was a little startled that there wasn\'t an actual shop, but the alleyway is lovely (nicest alley I\'ve ever seen!) and has places to sit.

You can tell it\'s a popular neighborhood place.I ordered the ""oatmeal latte"" because I thought I heard someone else order that and was curious. Turns out it\'s oat *milk* which happens to be surprisingly creamy and delicious.

The line of people into the alley shows they have a solid following, and I'm joining that following.

The library has all the books I need for this project. I decided to visit Blue Bottle for a stimulating cold brew. They had some syrup and half and half for it. The cold brew was a bit expensive and typical for coffee anyway. Blue Bottle has branding and experience. This spot is just a stand and there is no seating available. It's on Linden in a distant alley that is hard to find, but I wanted some Blue Bottle. It was my first purchase. There are other Blue Bottle shops in SF(mostly in FiDi). Blue Bottle is popular expensive. It's fun!"", ""What a great place to get your quick coffee fix and explore the Hayes Valley neighborhood! It's located off the busy streets of Gough and Fell st.

If you like the strong and bitter aroma of coffee with a little hint of sweetness, this is perfect for you!"", ""I stopped here after an early morning walk on a Sunday. Finding the place was part of the adventure! It's tucked in a little side street, likely to keep it a local secret! Kind service, cool sort of industrial storefront in a warehouse.

I'd love to go back."", 'I first tried Blue Bottle Coffee at this location when I used to work nearby. I absolutely love and recommend the Nola.

UpForDayz Coffee,"[""This coffee shop is unique! Their ordering method was unlike any coffee shop I've been to. Here's how it works. If you want coffee you order from their menu of a dark medium and light roast. Next you let them know how you want it prepared. French press, drip, and other options for preparation. Lastly you let them know how you like your cream and sugar and choose the type of creamer you'd like. The coffee was awesome. Very flavorful. They have lunch cards to reward you for frequenting."", ""Great coffee, great facilities, and, very importantly, great people.

(I saw the Stagg )* Opens LATE: they close at 8pm! So hard to find a coffee shop that opens past 5pm * Seating: 8 tables with 2-3 seats each so plenty of space * Coffee: uses their own roast! (customized mugs too)* Smoothies, coffees, teas, food, and pastries * Stamp card: buy 9, get 1 freeCONS:* Outlets: they have one at the front of the store, but it's not near the seats. Food:* Wake Me Up (Seraphim) - flavor was smooth but not as strong as I'd like, so I'd probably try a different brewing method or roast next time * OMG Sandwich - basically avocado toast with a boiled egg on top, but they add pomegranate seeds on top! Family owned cafe :) there's four of them working."", ""Overly-loud pop music coming though the speakers greeted me at the door. There were only two other customers sat typing away on laptops when I visited. Super important: the fewer the customers, the softer the music should be. One can raise the music as the cafe fills with folk chatting, but as this is a cafe & not a disco, then I'd opt to not crank up the jamz ('z' usage intentional).UpForDayz is like a shiny, new penny at this stage. It still has its 'new business smell' even. Would that it had more of a roasted coffee smell, given that there is a giant roaster parked at the back of the shop. Perhaps the roasting on premises has not yet begun? Maybe the machine is for show? Time will tell, I'd imagine. The filter coffee is fine. The cold brew isn't. One pays $4.50 for what appears to be a 10oz glass filled to the brim with ice-cubes, cold brew then making up the difference. It makes for a watery beverage.The coffee condiment counter is located at the back of the shop, about 30 feet from the entrance. The rubbish & recycling bins are to the back of the shop as well. It's a slightly awkward set-up for those of us wanting a quick cuppa to-go. All is not lost. The staff is polite. And the window seats at the front of the shop are decent for people-watching.

The quaint cafe with a serious surplus of sunlight is not even 3 weeks old at the time of this review. UpForDayz started roasting their own beans in the summer of love in none other than the \'Holy Land\' (Jerusalem) back in 1969; their love for coffee most definitely shows as they put lots of love into their cups of light, medium & dark roast coffee.What sets UpForDayz apart from other cafés aside from their serious machinery for brewing coffee is their warm and sincere welcome from the moment you set foot inside. They do not ask the impersonal and almost rhetorical, ""hey, how\'s it going?"" they actually say something along the lines of: ""Good morning, welcome!! How has your day been so far?

Lately, it's been more on the dislike side. I say that is because one time I took a bite into my beef brisket and it just tasted old or rotten. Like I immediately spat it out cause it just tasted sour. Another thing I personally don't like is the meat, a lot of it is frozen. You can tell it's not fresh once so ever, so personally that's how I kinda got that taste of the old meat. What I mean by frozen, is that the meat is not thawed out, they cut it frozen still. \xa0Not to mention, the servers don't really check up on you. Sometimes have to flag another person down, which I truly dislike cause I know they didn't sit us down so it's really not their responsibility to help us. Then there some of the rude servers where they will personally cut up your meat for you outta nowhere and serve it onto your plate. I don't like that because I like my meat cooked a certain way and the last time they did this, they didn't check that one side wasn't throughly cooked. I really hate roasting a company but people gotta know the experience.I think the only thing I would say about the place that's a positive is the price is reasonable but if you go for the 2nd price which gets you more meat, definitely not worth it.

It's quiet and relaxing and peaceful, and I am focused when I come here so I always feel good when I leave because I get a lot done! The atmosphere is super chill and the music is relaxing, most of the time instrumental. It's not necessarily a place to socialize.

There was only one person working there when I walked in around 9:45am on a Tuesday morning, but lots of people were at tables and seats reading or working, so it must be a pretty good place to work. Because there was only one person taking orders at the cash register and making drinks and preparing dishes and there was a line, there was a bit of a wait for my drink. I also worked there for about 15 minutes while I finished my drink and dish.I ordered the Yuzu Honey Tea and Lemon Meringue. I just wanted the tea, but there is a $6 credit card minimum so I added a baked good to my drink order and BAM by total went up from roughly $4.50 to $12. Well okay then. The Lemon Meringue was crisp and crunchy (from the meringue), with good but not great flavor that wasn't very strong or lemony. The Yuzu Honey Tea was pricey for what you get but refreshing and flavorful.

It looked like they were intensely studying. There were also a few couches to hang out on. If I lived nearby and needed a place to work, I\'d consider it.The food, however, was pretty disappointing. I had the sweet potato latte - which was good - but nothing unique if you\'ve had the Korean latte drink mixes before (Woori Market is around the corner - highly recommended). I wonder if they just used a drink mix and added some foam on top. I also had a slice of yuzu pound cake, which was very dry. The yuzu syrup on top was fragrant with a strong citrus punch - such a shame it didn\'t permeate the entire cake! Certainly a work in progress.

I would've given 5 stars yet the gal at the sandwich board was meticulous yet incredibly slow paced at placing of all things on the sandwiches, making it take very long.

It says that it's a 2 hours limit however when I asked for clarification with the staff, they said that it's a honor system. There wasn't that many people that day so the staff said that it's okay.

One of the best I've had. I also ordered their poptart-like pastry. Ask the staff for their recommendation and they said the one with brown sugar filling (other options were apricot and Nutella). Not worth the money at all. It looks cute, but it didn't taste like anything. Couldn't really taste the brown sugar. The only delicious thing about it was the crust. Service: All of them were just chilling. They were helpful but seems uninterested. It might be because it's two days before Thanksgiving? Back to the point, I asked them to heat up my pastry.

If you are looking for a nice quiet peaceful spot to grab a coffee and read a book, this may not be the ideal place for you. They have a cute little cafe space with a couple of baristas serving up high-quality coffee, tea, and bagels and sandwiches. There is a lovely outdoor patio space, however they don't provide enough tables, and as a result the four or five tables end up feeling a little bit cramped next to your neighbors. The overall vibe is like a watering hole for parents to restock on caffeine to continue running around with their children, while stopping in for a little snack break. The view is lovely though, and I would certainly return earlier in the morning for some peace and quiet."", ""Well wouldn't this have been great when Law School Girl was little and we were at the Randall all of the time?

Sightglass Coffee,"[""Such a cute little spot. We came here on a Saturday afternoon and it was actually full. We were hoping to find a nice quiet place to sit down and get some reading done but we ended up just grabbing some coffee and walking around.We got a vanilla latte and it came out beautifully. It had so much flavor and them foam and crema was perfect. We even saw bits of real vanilla at the bottom of the cup. A little expensive but hey it's SF. We'll try to come back when it's less busy so we can enjoy the quaint vibe of this place."", ""Normally I love cozy little coffee shops, but this place is just not up par to other coffee shops in SF. Here's why:- extremely limited options for milk. They only have whole milk and sweetened almond milk- unfriendly staff who are in their head- no wifi (which is common on the weekend for most popular places) - barely any seatingAlthough their Cold Brew was good, me thinks not for coming again :(."", ""For a fancy coffee joint, it was just average for me. \xa0If it's good espresso, then it should have a balanced taste. \xa0However the espresso con panna tasted a bit sour. It may have been a bad batch of whipped cream. \xa0However the cappuccino wasn't that impressive either. The milk didn't mask the subpar coffee flavor. I liked the decor and atmosphere.

I like this mission location a lot just because it is more of a to go place with some indoor seating and no wifi. People come as they please and the overall mood here is relaxing and peaceful. I got a chilled flashed coffee which was something that sounds very cool, but really means the hot drip coffee was poured into a cup with ice. I did like how sightglass encourages customers to bring their own cups/jars etc. The only thing that kinda grossed me out was that there was a horseshoe fly buzzing around in the pastry display and that turned me off from buying anything in there. But overall, good service at this location and would come again.', 'What a cute cute cute cafe that makes super good good good coffee located in an industrial area (is it really called Dog Patch?). It is within walking distance from Tartine Manufactury (wink, wink).Ordered their Mocha and you could tell that dark chocolate was used.', ""Great hipster coffee place and a popular location for all the Mission folks. There's almost always people hanging out inside and on the bench outside with Sightglass drinks. I have yet to try their regular coffees, but the vanilla cold brew was very smooth and refreshing, albeit a bit sweet for my tastes. The mocha is hands-down my favorite drink. The chocolate is bittersweet, so its not overwhelming sweet like the typical mocha's you would get. You can also easily substitute dairy with almond or soy milk as well. Each hot drink is made carefully and with some kind of heart-like latte art too :) Wait time might be a bit longer as they don't rush the process. Condiments and caps are located in a corner at the back of the store. Also they take NFC payments and tap cards."", ""Last stop in SF before heading to the airport.

Video sketch on all 3 locations. youtu.be/CKyLAk5jzuQThis location is in Mission/Dogpatch area. Compared to shops on Divisadero(medium) or 7th street(large), the space here is small size. A lot of people come and go in the morning, so sometimes you have to wait for a seat. Because it's not a large space, crowd is more quiet. The lighting, color, furniture, tile, etc.. give you a warm and special feeling and their design theme continues in other stores like the one on Divisadero. Again, I think their coffee and the thought they put in spatial design is on another level :) Stop here to get coffee and then you can head to Tartine Manufactory to grab pastry. (5min walk) Only negative thing is it's difficult to find parking."", ""Everything about Sightglass is literal coffee goals. I've heard about it many times from coffee folks, and have seen their beans served everywhere here in San Diego. I've finally visited it for the first time and was totally amused by it. Their aesthetics are on point, the elegant wooden coffee shop vibe with the honeycomb floors. Their coffee is great, and like I said earlier they have their beans for wholesale everywhere in California. It's almost a staple that good coffee is served here if you see Sightglass coffee beans. Not the biggest shop (I believe the one on 7th street is bigger with two floors), but everything about it screams SF. The baristas, the decor, the customers, you name it.

Central Coffee Tea & Spice,"[""I just moved to the NOPA neighborhood and have been sneaking around the area to test the cafe's, and this one is a gem! Their building blends right into the character of the neighborhood, and once inside it's super cozy with a rustic bohemian vibe. There's a lot of the menu I haven't tried yet, but their pastries are delicious and I think my favorite drink so far is the iced latte with oat milk -- very creamy, well-brewed espresso, and the roast is not too acidic or smokey. Baristas are super friendly and attentive, and maybe it's packed during certain hours but in the middle of the day on a Wednesday it's not crammed with laptopers like a lot of the places on Divisadero.

The Coffee Movement,"[""Wonderful little coffee shop. It's normally staffed with just one really awesome and kind barista at a time, so be patient and expect good coffee.

This place is not your sit down coffee shop, it's more of a stop and go place. There are no chairs inside and it's a bit small. The menu consist of various unique coffee and tea. I went with the vanilla spice latte, and it was very delicious.

If I had to model my future kitchen area, I would use this shop as inspiration. It's minimal, no-nonsense, and really puts the focus on the coffee and how it's being made. I'd go as far as to say that the all-white interior was so that the coffee could provide the colour. I've been here twice, having ordered a cappuccino and a latte. Both times, I was in awe at how much grace and passion went into making my cup. The attention to detail in providing an experience was evident, as I also was passed a lid on a small saucer. Talk about making me feel special.Both coffees were ready to drink, at the right temperature right away. I couldn't taste any hints of the espresso being burnt, and it tasted oh-so-smooth. I knew I couldn't get my coffee from anywhere else now.

It didn't have any acidic bitterness to it and was incredibly smooth (and caffeinated). The space itself is pretty small and minimalistic, which lends itself well to the modern coffeeshop aesthetic.

The Richfield,"[""I love this place so much! It's a block from my apartment and I feel so lucky to have it as my local coffee spot. The drinks and pastries are all delicious, they let me bring my dog in, there's outdoor seating, and it's cozy AF. The best part of this place though is the people who work here. I'm not sure how this owner screens his applicants but bravo because every individual who works here has such a kind calm soul.Thank you Richfield for keeping me caffeinated and happy."", 'Super sad/disappointing - they have DISCONTINUED the ricotta toast. (they said they were replacing it with something soon.Service was painfully slow. looks like the avocado is smashed to order - which maybe I would enjoy - but since they get an order for it every other customer - maybe make a batch for 15 toasts, then start again - it would still be super fresh - but faster.We ordered the avocado toast and the breakfast sandwich (it was light on bacon - maybe 1.5 slices), a chai and a mocha. It was about $25. we left hungry.The water glasses could be used as thimbles - seriously I have never seen smaller glasses.', ""The Richfield is a great local coffee shop with a good amount of outdoor seating to relax at! \xa0I've gotten the cold brew ($4.50) a couple of times and it tasted a bit lighter than what I'm used to getting at other places, but it was still smooth and pretty good. \xa0Something I super appreciate and love about this place is that they serve their cold brew with coffee ice cubes so your drink doesn't get watered down! \xa0It's such a small and easy thing to do, but I've never seen any other place do this before. \xa0It really shows that they care about their product and it shows they care about their customers' satisfaction.The couple of times I've been here, the toast has been sold out unfortunately. \xa0I usually come later in the afternoon, so I'll be sure to make a visit earlier in the day sometime to try those out! \xa0Definitely recommend a visit if you're ever in the area."", 'Spic and span, simple but delicious coffee inspired by a Chicago Boxing Match; unfortunately the first time Ali was defeated. Historic news clips and some memorabilia spot the walls, and some mellow hip hop playing this afternoon. Close to the laundromat. Grab a latte to sip and pass the time!', ""I was in the area and wanted a coffee and stumbled upon this place. The Richfield is a small little coffee shop in the Inner Richmond district. There are a few tables inside and outside, and they offer free WiFi. There is a nice vibe here, I saw a couple people chilling and some doing work! I looked at the menu and ordered the Cold Brew. The Cold Brew was good, smooth and not too bitter. It came with coffee ice cubes, a very nice touch to keep the ice from diluting the drink.I came on a weekday afternoon and found street parking fairly easily. The staff was nice and friendly. Convenient neighborhood coffee shop to visit if you're ever in the area!"", ""Definitely a good spot if you have a minute to relax or even on the go, The Richfield has you covered.

The service is always on point. The guys here are always attentive ready to serve and help. They actually seem like they really enjoy what they are doing:RARE. \xa0I've never had a bad experience here. I only get the americanos or coffee with espresso that's my thing."", 'Great little cafe. And when I say little.... like tinyyyy. Super friendly people. Good coffee too, I tend to be pretty picky and they have my approval. Also avocado toast.... no need to say more. I wish I lived nearby to walk to this place each morning.', ""Love this place! Coffee is great and service is consistently friendly. Place is tiny, but that doesn't mean there's no atmosphere. It's casual here and I love the green walls. Parking is not easy if you're not in the neighborhood already. Came here recently on a Saturday morning and there were families, groups, individuals, everyone in the neighborhood basically coming over to Richfield. I'm assuming you will be next! I ordered a latte and banana bread. Everything came out to $8 total. Delicious everything!"", ""What a cute little coffee shop! It's pretty easy to miss as it's in a funny triangle at California and 5th. This is what good coffee should taste like.After living in Australia for a number of years I'm always on the lookout for a real Aussie style flat white and this did not disappoint. Exactly the right size and the espresso was smooth and perfect. I was only visiting SFO for a couple of days and made sure to come back 2 mornings in a row to get my FW. I found them on Yelp and they definitely earn the great reviews."", 'I have been to many coffeehouse while traveling and few of them make a quality cup of coffee. \xa0Richfield does not disappoint. \xa0Our group had lattes, a flat white, and an Americano. \xa0All of these had the correct ratio of milk to espresso, or water to espresso, along with correctly pulled shots. The baristas obviously love coffee and put that love into each cup.', 'Brekkie Sandwich - lives up to the hype. \xa0Simple ingredients, but delicious.Cold Brew - they use ice cubes made with coffee to keep the brew from tasting watered down as you savor every sip. \xa0So novel and simple that not even the big coffee chains do it. \xa0Props to The Richfield on that.Seating - they promptly opened at 7:30 and I got one of the few seats inside. \xa0Enjoyed a good book while eating and drinking. \xa0Small interior, but very relaxing.Will try their Avocado Toast and a hot brew next time...', 'Have you even gone to a coffee shop and asked ""May I get a cup of coffee"" and received the snooty response ""well, this IS a coffee shop.""? \xa0I have a couple of times over the years and don\'t really appreciate the sarcasm, particularly when I still haven\'t had my morning cup. \xa0And while I haven\'t been given this response at The Richfield, I feel like they want to say that. \xa0If you ask for a cappuccino or latte with non-fat milk (as my SO often does) you are at the very least told that they don\'t have non-fat, but might be told the additional detail that non-fat milk doesn\'t make quite a proper type of foam. \xa0Don\'t get me wrong, we like the Richfield food and coffee and enjoy the boxing theme and old copies of The Ring magazine to browse. \xa0And the location is sort of cool - what for years was a wedge shaped island off of California is now a small 2 story building with The Richfield in the lower floor.The breakfast items are tasty and well made, the coffee drinks are good (though I have a couple other preferences in SF). \xa0So we stop in when we are in the area and in need of a bite or coffee. \xa0Prices are a touch high, but not out of line. \xa0They don\'t seem big on substitutions, and if you want almond milk be prepared to fork over another $0.75 for your drink. \xa0And ask for Earl Grey tea (the preference of my SO) and they may look down on you as being too pedestrian (which is funny because there is no parking in the area so only pedestrians can get there).It just seems that they have a bit of an attitude - maybe it\'s the boxing décor that brings it out in them. \xa0Hopefully it won\'t turn people off from going there - though there is a bit of competition in the area with Beanstalk, Blue Danube, and Cumaica all within a block or three. \xa0I expect a bit of attitude in the Marina or SOMA, but not in Inner Richmond.So 5 stars for the food and boxing theme, 4 for the location and coffee, 3 for the limited tea selection and perceived attitude. \xa0A 4 star review.', ""I love this tiny coffee shop in the median of an intersection. It's a cute neighborhood spot to pop in for a coffee or a snack.I just get whatever latte or ice coffee drink that I'm feeling that day, and (if I'm lucky), snag a seat at one of the 3 tiny, 2-3 person tables they have. When the weather is nice, sometimes there are 2, 2-seater tables outside.They also have a little counter that I've seen some people stand at to do work. I personally don't find the environment conducive to working, but it's fun to people watch and read a little on a slow day. I also tend to prefer small cozy coffee shops to large ones.The service is friendly, the drinks are pretty average (though they have a few interesting selections and a large variety of tea), and the food is pretty unique. I think the breakfast sandwich is popular (but not a stunner, according to my NYC-breakfast-sandwhich-loving friend). I have also tried the sesame ricotta toast topped with strawberries, coconut flakes, and honey. It's an interesting combination, and I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure if it completely worked. Maybe in strawberry season, when the strawberries are a little more naturally sweet, it would make sense.Almond milk is extra and they will remind you like Chipotle employees remind you that guac is extra."", ""I don't write many of these but I had to write about my experience at the Richfield. As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a friendly smile and my order was taken right away. The place is tiny but has a comfy atmosphere. When my latte was ready it was brought out to me with another friendly greeting. Everyone here (employees and customers) seem comfortable and pleasant. The drink itself was excellent and the milk was super foamy. The almond croissant I got was also very good. There's also some outdoor seating to enjoy the weather when it's nice. Not a great place for working but if you just need a good drink and a place to read/hang out this place should be considered."", ""Great for a quick brunch or coffee on the go! My beau and I grabbed two brekkie sandwiches and a couple of coffees to-go, but ended up eating outside when a table opened up.

But what takes The Richfield above and beyond is their unique and delicious food menu. I was obsessed with the black sesame ricotta toast topped with fresh strawberries and coconut. I've never seen this combo anywhere else but as soon as I spotted it on the menu it was a where-have-you-been-all-my-life type of moment! Though it's teeny with just a few small tables, it's a great addition to this neighborhood and I'm jealous of people who live in the area and can stop by on the regular. I'll definitely be back on my next trip to SF!"", 'Super cute small coffee spot! The workers are very knowledgeable and helpful with the menu. they answered all my questions and helped me choose what to order.

Maybe I'm the only one ordering ice cream so the ice cream is old and cold and frozen over like Hell.The coffee shot on top was okay. A little bitter but overall not worth the $5 I paid.$4.50 plus 50¢ tip.Their coffee is on the strong side which isn't my particular taste. I'm more of a medium flavored coffee drinker.

Black Sugar,"[""Good boba is few and far between on my little island, so I always try to get my fix while traveling. \xa0The brightly colored instagram worthy photos at Black Sugar caught my eye and piqued my interest. \xa0After scrolling through the photos, they had me at mango matcha latte. \xa0I love the strawberry matcha boba from another popular joint up the street, so this was right up my alley. \xa0Much like their shop, they have a small, but sufficient menu that includes choices of milk teak, fruit tea, fresh milk, matcha, & coffee. \xa0Their favorite flavors are on the left and you have the option to choose the level of sweetness for your drink. \xa0Skimping on sweetness is pretty much blasphemy for me, so you know 100% sweet all the way! \xa0They even have liquid cane syrup available for that extra sugar overload.Being a lover of all things mango, I went with the mango matcha latte of course and tried it without mixing it first just to see. \xa0Got a straight shot of that sweet boba goodness and it was yuuuumm! \xa0They were the perfect consistency, chewy and not overcooked. \xa0I mixed it up as instructed and wow, I am a fan! \xa0I loved that mango flavor which seemed thicker than the matcha layer (or it could've been the boba syrup?) and it was just divine. My friend & I loved it so much we went back for a second round of drinks before catching our flight! \xa0The second time, I got it extra sweet, and yep, good decision. \xa0Can't have too much sugar. \xa0Ever.So, if you're staying in the Union Square area & love boba, GO NOW. \xa0This shop is easily accessible and there's no line. \xa0Don't blink though or you may miss it! \xa0It's tiny with room to seat only four patrons, but definitely worth the stop."", 'Whaaat, this place is different from the typical boba places that I have been to. They have different flavors that I would have never thought of doing plus a few standard ones.First time here, I tried the matcha sesame latte. It had the perfect blend of all the ingredients. Forwarding on this drink... you will get sesame in your teeth, so be sure to have some floss.. lol. The boba is cooked perfectly and has a slight sweetness to it. With this being said, I thought it gave the perfect sweetness to my drink (I requested no sugar) This has by far been my favorite drink in San Fran.Second time I came, I tried the mango matcha latte. It was very pretty and flavorful, yet I still loved the matcha sesame better. Other flavors I tried were pear green tea and the lychee green tea. The pear tea was sooooo good! The lychee was also a nice refreshing drink and has pieces of lychee in it.Now, I will try and find a place in my home town that serves up drinks this delicious and creative!', ""The Mango Matcha Latte reminded me of a variation of the Strawberry Matcha latte at Boba Guys. \xa0I ordered the Mango Matcha Latte at 70% sweetness with boba. \xa0At first sip, you could taste a good mix of the mango and matcha, neither being too overpowering. \xa0The boba however stood out to me as it seemed to be sweeter than the actual drink. \xa0The boba was quite firm but not too soft. \xa0The cup that the drink came in was cute and something that could possibly be reused. \xa0 The service was quick and prompt. \xa0I came in on a Tuesday afternoon so it wasn't too busy. \xa0I would suggest this place if you're looking for somewhere to sit for a while as they only have about 4 stools available. \xa0Overall, I would suggest this place if you're in the area or if you're like me and you're always seeing pictures on Instagram of this place! \xa0Definitely worth a try!"", ""Cold brew matcha latte and roasted oolong are delicious. Fruity teas are great as well. This place has good drinks, but be warned it's tiny. If you need a place to sit and chill you can always pop into the Hilton across the street."", 'So f\'ing good the first time - five stars. The second time was not as good - four stars.I\'m conflicted because the first black sugar fresh milk with pearls/boba $4.45 was so damn good. The black sugar fresh milk tasted almost exactly like an ice caramel macchiato, which I miss since I can\'t have caffeine anymore. The boba texture was perfect. Bouncy and not too soft lol.The second time I visited, the flavor of the ""black sugar"" burnt sugar was weaker. The pearls were just as good as before. Both times we had about a ten minute wait after ordering because they were making the pearls. The freshness of their small-batch pearl preparation must be the key to the excellent texture. The taro milk with almond milk $4.95 is also a good option. They can\'t adjust the sweetness level because the taro and sugar is already pre-mixed, but not to worry - \xa0it\'s not too sweet. The tall guy at the cash register has good customer service skills. I noticed he is careful to tell customers special instructions. It\'s still one of the top places for boba in the city for me even though I actually don\'t drink milk tea. I don\'t know how anybody finds parking around here. We take public transportation or a lyft to the mall/union square for shopping and then come here afterwards. There\'s an expensive parking garage next door. They only have four or so seats inside. Halal Guys is next door which is convenient in case you want to order some food to-go while you\'re waiting for the boba to be prepared.*I was wrong about a charge for almond milk. Management let me know that it\'s actually no extra charge for it. Thank you!They haven\'t addressed the plastic and/or recycling issue though. The thick plastic cups seem kind of wasteful especially since most people don\'t recycle them and the shop doesn\'t seem to recycle them either. The cups have survived my dishwasher and I\'ve reused them multiple times - bpa be damned.', ""Finally got the chance to come visit Black Sugar. We arrived on a Sunday morning a few minutes before it opened and there was already a couple waiting in front of us. Soon after, more people were gathered in line. I ordered the Taro matcha latte with boba (subbed almond milk). This drink comes with a non-customizable sweetness level but I did not think it was too sweet. I really appreciated that you can sub almond milk without an extra charge. They use real taro but it was smooth, not gritty. It added a thickness to the drink. Make sure to thoroughly mix your drink, which the cashier advised. The boba was a good chewiness and added a bit more sweetness to the drink. The matcha was very aromatic. i tried my fiance's black sesame milk and that was also really good. The black sesame was not too gritty when swallowed, like some places make it. Will try the black sugar fresh milk next time! Although the drink is on the pricier side, especially because it's like a 16oz size, I think you're getting a pretty high quality drink that tastes great. Only three or four seats along the window inside, so this is really a pick up and go type of shop."", ""Yay work friends! My work friend had been away for a while but finally made it back into SF, so a celebratory drink was in order. He's a bubble tea fan, so he'd had this place scoped out.I got the matcha taro latte (I am quite susceptible to Yelp peer pressure, then always insta-regret it). Like all other boba shops, you can customize the sweetness (usually, although not on the matcha taro latte) and the ice. The regular sweetness was actually not super sweet, though I almost prefer my teas to be slightly bitter.The drink was aesthetically pleasing, with the light green matcha atop the silky purple taro. The taro was well pulverized into a powdery form, lightly sweetened, but didn't really stand out in any way (e.g., super taro-y). The matcha felt a bit powdery in my mouth (maybe the taro got into it somehow?). It didn't taste like the low-quality powder mix some spots use for matcha, but it also lacked the deep richness I crave in matcha. The outside of the boba was slick, and the inside also had that slickness mixed with the chewiness. Boba is lightly sweetened, but I always think that the sweeter the boba, the better (omg honey drenched boba). Not watered down.The shop itself is pretty small, just a counter for ordering and 4 bar stools by the window. Clean, simple white and wood aesthetic like many modernly designed shops these days. There was a line 10 deep at 1:30pm on Wednesday.Overall, drink was a nice after lunch pick-me-up, but I don't think I'd walk out of my way for it. Maybe I should try the namesake next time! 3.5/5 overall"", ""By far the best boba spot I have tried while on my boba excursion on Saturday. This shop is pocket sized with a pretty small menu. There's like 4 seats that faces towards the window so take your drinks to go. You kind of can't hang out inside because it gets full fast. I ordered the Mango Matcha with boba and my sister had the Matcha with boba. Mine had a good balance of Matcha and mango which made the sweetness perfect. The boba was good too. There was one cashier calling out orders while someone else was in the back making drinks. They were getting through the line that kept building up. I appreciated the efficiency. They also have sugar on the side if your drink isn't sweet enough and my sister had to go to it a few times before enjoying her drink. The regular sweetness in San Francisco is so different from Vegas. I started questioning if my drinks are actually too sweet to begin with."", ""One of the best boba places in SF (and at a much lower price point than most as well). Cheaper than boba guys, same quality matcha. Milk substitutions are free too!Black sesame matcha is my favorite so far, their milk drinks and house milk tea are great too. Service is quick and friendly - stop by if you're in the area!Other pros: close to the mall/union square, and Kin Khao"", ""One of the best boba places I've tried in SF hands down. This place may seem like an unassuming hole-in-the-wall, but boy are they a boba powerhouse. We ordered the matcha mango latte with 70% sweetness, and we received our drink in less than 5 minutes after ordering it. Although the drink itself was still very sweet (a bit too much for my liking), I really enjoyed the creaminess and richness of the milk. The balance between the mango and matcha was truly harmonious, and the flavors itself were pretty subtle. The pearls were amazing - the perfect bouncy texture and size, and nicely sweetened. I would love to come back and try their tea-flavored drinks. Come here if you want unique, high quality boba."", ""Black Sugar are known for their Milk Teas like Latte & Matcha. My friend got the Milk Tea was perfectly sweeten and the boba was chewy and I also got the Lychee Peach with Lychee Jelly. It tastes similar to Pit Stop Boba at Westborough because they use real Lychee! They don't use plastic cups, they use a higher quality cup for matchas and latte. With a simple cute logo. The place is simple and not that big. Limited seating. Staff was super friendly! The guy at the cashier always ask customers how their drinks are! But it's a good grab to go boba stop."", ""BLACK SUGAR FRESH MILK FTW!!! I was so excited to visit this place because of all the good things that my friends have been telling me. I came here on a Thursday afternoon around 4 PM and the place had a line already. The line does not seem too bad and moved pretty quickly. I waited for about 5 minutes with 10 people ahead of me and when I go to the cashier, the girl who helped me was very nice and explained to me how there are certain drinks on the menu cannot be adjusted (sugar level). I opted in for one of their top favorites - Black Sugar Fresh Milk with boba. The boba shop is not too big but it is big enough for a couple high chairs where you can sit and wait for your drinks to be made or have a quick chat. Anyways- the drinks did not take too long to make and when I got my drink I couldn't help but Instagram it with the cute little lucky cat wall that they have outside the boba shop. The drink was really good and the texture of the boba was cooked just right. Pricing is not outrageous either for it being in SF. I am glad that they opened it in a walking distance from Union Square/ DTSF. I saw alot of people ordered their Mango Matcha Latte with boba and that looked really IG worthy as well. Next time, I will definitely come back and check out their other drinks!"", ""Solid boba shop in the Powell/Tenderloin area. I ordered the Taro Matcha Latte with Califia Almond Milk and it was very creamy and flavorful. Not too sweet! I tried my friends drink and it was a little sweet for the both of us. They kindly offered to adjust the sweetness level :) The boba was a tad too soft at first but the cool drink cooled/hardened it in a few minutes. I wouldn't go out of my way to go to Black Sugar but if I was in the area and was craving milk tea or a matcha latte, I'd go back. Service is friendly and quick. Check it out!"", 'My first time in San Fran... nice city but where the heck are all my boba places?!?! Where the Asians at? \xa0The fug?!?!

Cute shop, tiny, 4 bar stools... order & go. \xa0Service was OK, not sure why no one was manning the counter - until the girl saw me waiting, then a guy popped out from the back and took my order. My drink takes no time to make - if you\'ve had it, you\'ll know. \xa0Took a quick 2 mins and got my drink. Here they call it ""Black Sugar Milk""... welp, the boba is not as soft as others I\'ve had, puts WAAAYYY too much ice - making the balance of brown sugar boba vs. milk like 50% milk - 20% boba - 30% ice; so gone in 60 seconds. \xa0Tsk Tsk. \xa0This is what I\'d call ""desperately seeking brown sugar boba"" and I was, otherwise, this is a skippo!', 'A rather small hole in the way on the outside of a parking structure. Have been wanting to try this new boba spot and definitely not disappointed.I ordered a Matcha Sesame Latte, with boba and light ice. Recommendation is to stay at 100% sweetness and it was perfect. I loved the mixture of matcha and sesame. My cousin ordered for herself a classic black milk tea without boba at 70% sweetness. She preferred my matcha drink over her own drink. Next time I want to try their fruit drinks such as Mango Matcha and Peach tea.', 'First timer! Came on a Wednesday, no wait & accidentally ordered a roasted milk tea...! After i realized my mistake i hurry and ask if its ok to change to mango matcha milk tea & paid a $.50 cent different~ pheww that was close! Ugh it was so good! Perfect sweetness in default level! I cant wait to be back . P.S: My girlfriend ordered a pineapple fruit tea, which was nothing special just very flavorful pineapple juice like.', ""Top notch boba! I had their lychee green tea with boba (70% sweetness) and it was delicious. They said their 100% sweetness is not too sweet compared to other boba shops, and they were right. I usually get 25-50% sweetness, and 70% at this place was perfect. The boba itself is perfectly chewy and had a great dark, malty sweetness. I tried my friend's black sesame milk (with almond milk) and it was delicious as well. If you don't mind the grittiness that is normal with sesame, I highly recommend. It was sweeter than the green tea, so I'd go with 50%.All in all, tasty boba place. If I'm ever in the area, I'd stop by again."", 'There aren\'t many places out there that do black sugar fresh milk with boba well. This is probably one of my favorite places that makes this type of drink. The black sugar and milk ratio is close to perfect and there is nothing else added except the black sugar and the milk, which I appreciate. No extra sugar or fillings. The boba is on the harder chewier side, so if you like that, this place is for you. I usually always get no ice for my drinks because I have sensitive teeth and I don\'t like drinking anything too cold. They only have a ""less ice"" option for this drink.... which I can never understand. Perhaps give the customers an option to add water instead of ice next time. Despite this, I still really enjoyed the drink and would recommend! Also, I felt like the prices were pretty reasonable. Interior: very small, there\'s a bar with maybe 4 seats that\'s right in front of the cashier. I can see lines flowing out of the store because there\'s no space! It\'s more of a grab and go type place. Service: the people were very nice and even asked me how the drink was!', ""Wow, I like Black Sugar a lot! My boyfriend and I were in the city for the day and we wanted boba! We were in downtown and I remember hearing about Black Sugar so we decided to check this place out!The location is pretty convenient. It is a short walk from the mall. The store itself is not too big. It's more of a grab and go place rather than a place to hang out. They do have four chairs. I thought there would be a long line but we went around 2pm on a Saturday and there were only three people in front of us. We ordered one drink for each of us and they came out fairly quickly.My boyfriend ordered the House Black Milk Tea and I ordered the Oolong Milk Tea. Both drinks had boba. The Black Milk Tea tasted like Hong Kong Style Milk Tea.The quality was great and they had strong tea flavor. Even the cups were really good quality.Our drinks came out to be less than $10 in the heart of San Francisco. That's a steal! I cannot wait to come back to try their other drinks. Their other drinks looked really pretty and delicious too."", ""Heard about Black Sugar from someone and I've had it BM it for awhile. I usually don't make my way DT so didn't really have any chances to check out BS. Finally got to try it today. A lot smaller space than I thought. It's maybe 10x5 occupant space in front of the counter. I got the Roast Oolong Milk tea. They definitely know how to make a Roast Oolong MT right as it had that right amount of roasted and bitter tea flavor. The boba was just the right consistency of chewiness. The size of the drink was surprisingly small considering most places give you 24oz cup standard now while here gives you 16oz standard. BS is a lot like like Little Sweet in terms of flavor and texture at least for their Roast Oolong. Though little sweet gives you a larger cup and it's much more convenient for me to go there than coming to BS.

Blue Bottle Coffee,"[""Really nice coffee shop. I was visiting from out of town and stumbled on this place when I was looking for a coffee shop near my hotel. I typically don't like experimenting with new and different coffee drinks (I stick to my usual iced or hot latte), but I decided to be a little spontaneous and asked the barista what he'd recommend, which was some sort of New Orleans drink. I really enjoyed it and now hate that I'm rarely ever in SF cause it was really good. I gave them 4 stars because I wish they had more food options. I was there around breakfast time and they only had a few cookies and croissants, not a lot of options."", ""The best coffee in the city, although I do love \xa0almond rose coffee from illy. There is something about bluebottle coffee that drinks very smooth for me which I like a lot. The stores are also bright, clean and efficient which is my favorite kind of place.Staff has always been really friendly and the wait times aren't crazy."", ""So I am a big coffee fan. I grew up in Cambodia and traveled to Vietnam a lot and these are big coffee drinking country so coffee was my go-to drink ever since I was a kid. I'm always out looking for the best coffee in every city and here I am at another great one in the city, Blue Bottle Coffee.Blue Bottle has become big enough that they are in whole foods and have multiple locations in the city, but that doesn't mean they become overrated. This is the first time I've been to one of their locations since I usually just pick up a cold brew at Whole Foods so I was pretty excited. I'm also a sucker for aesthetically pleasing coffee shops so I can get instagram worthy shots as well so this place was a hit! I got the Cafe Mocha with Hayes Valley blend and asked for very little sugar and it was amazing! The latte art is nice and cute and they filled it up to the very top so I hate to walk like an old lady to get to our seats and grab an instagram worthy picture. I also LOVE marble and this location is filled with marbles as their counter/tabletops. So aesthetically pleasing, check, marble, check, great looking cup of coffee, check AND coffee that actually taste as good as they look, CHECK! I love everything except the fact that they don't have wifi or outlets. This is pretty shocking to me because there are decent amount of seating everywhere and working at coffee shop is kind of a thing for me, so it was a bummer. Now...I am writing this review, on my laptop here...but of course I have to tether myself to get internet and I have an external battery pack to charge my laptop so if you do still want to do some work here, I highly recommend packing some external battery and having tethering or some way to access the internet. Otherwise, it is more recommended for catching up with friends or some light browsing that you won't kill your battery for. This is probably the only reason why I would put this place as a 4/5 instead of 5/5.TLDR: Great coffee, Instagram worthy coffee shop, no outlets or wifi."", 'A great coffee stop while walking around downtown San Francisco.We swung in to this location when we flagged the blue bottle logo; we had hoped to try it while in SF, but hadn\'t gone out of our way to find one yet.The place was steady when we were there at noonish on a Saturday, but it didn\'t take long to order. I got a cold brew (warmer in SF than Virginia this time of year, and I had been walking with my baby on my back, so I felt too hot for a hot coffee drink) which came right out, and was tasty and smooth.It was right on par with most local coffee roaster cold brews and would be a good go to for the warmer days. I can\'t give it five stars because my bar has been set (maybe unusually) high by a coffee roaster back in Virginia whose cold brew just floats down your throat, sending caffeine into your bloodstream like a spoon full of sugar as Mary Poppins would say. But I digress.My husband got a holiday blend drip, but we watched them make it and they made a pour over, so because it was a pour over it took a few minutes to come out. I\'m not sure if they always do pour overs rather than a typical drip, or if something was wrong with their coffeemaker, because it did say drip on the menu, not pour over. His coffee was really good, hot and festive with a hint of spice, without having any overpowering, cloying ""holiday"" flavors.I would definitely frequent blue bottle if I was local to the Bay Area, and will revisit if I return!', ""Great coffee. Looks like it has classes for learning how to brew slow drip coffee. Nuff said.Ample seating with like ~25-30 ish seats to sit down and work at. No Wi-Fi and didn't see any outlets though :(. However there is the #SFWifi it is kinda slow and the Target Guest Wifi across the street. Very bright location with very big windows. Has some pastries and a great place to pick up some coffee making accessories. Not to packed on a rainy SF Saturday.Pros:-Supports Apple Pay.-Good amount of seating-Barista Training ($20 Brew Class Saturday 12-1PM)-Doesn't seem too packed-Bathroom exists before the elevators left of the security guard-Free Water beside the cash (they have cups you can use)-Not extremely loudCons:-No Wi-Fi-No Outlets (bring some USB-C battery packs for your Macbooks)"", ""If I were simply reviewing Blue Bottle's coffee, I would comfortably give it 5 stars. In fact, I would be disappointed that I couldn't give it more. The New Orleans Cold Brew and their oat milk lattes are some of the best coffee in the Bay. I am also a huge fan of just about all of their pour overs, and even will grab a mocha from time to time. Nothing here has come even remotely close to disappointing me.There are two things that prevent me from giving it the perfect score, though. One of those things is the fact that the wait for coffee here is ALWAYS long. I came in at 6am one day, and it tool 6 minutes to get a latte. Granted, it was because they were doing training, but my goodness there were 3 of us in there. That's simply too long, IMO. Especially when their on-peak wait times are almost double that, if you're unlucky. It bums me out.Secondly, there is no Wi-Fi here. Huge bummer. I love this place so much, but I feel like a total loser going into Starbucks or Peet's with a Blue Bottle cup and just freeloading. I would come here a lot more if it were a realistic destination at which to do some work. Sadly unless I use my hot-spot, it is not. Woof.Anyway, the coffee and service here are fantastic. These folks know and love coffee, and you can definitely taste the care that goes into the craft. Just wish it didn't take so darn long. Or, if it were going to take long, that I could get some work done while I wait. What a shame!"", 'Oat milk latte. Enough said. Blue bottle does it again! Great, smooth taste. And this location is particularly lovely with the large arches and windows. Great for a morning coffee hit.', ""Blue Bottle is (admittedly) overpriced and extremely slow, but they are extremely consistent in the quality of their coffee. Amongst the different high end coffee shops in the city, Blue Bottle still reigns as one of my favorites (both for mochas and lattes). This one usually has a line out the shop since it's in a high-density working area. There's two payment areas but I've usually only seen one person behind the register, so the line moves pretty slowly for the high volume of patrons who frequent this shop. It probably doesn't matter in the end, though, because the space behind the counter is extremely small and the rate that the drinks are produced is alarmingly slow. There's usually a couple baristas for espresso drinks, and one doing the drip coffees and tea. I will likely still come to this location, but make sure you allot yourself up to 15m (or more) minutes during peak times, like in the mornings before work."", 'AMAZING service! Drink came out to perfection. A wonderful start to another crazy day in the Bay!', ""This Blue Bottle Coffee is just plain cool. Nestled inside the lobby of a classic office building in downtown San Francisco, this modern bar looks almost as great as their coffee drinks. Access is though the lobby without a dedicated entrance with only street parking available. My Sunday morning visit was packed with Outside Lands visitors trying to catch a morning buzz. There were a few morning runners and maybe a few bringing a drink back to their Saturday night guest! This location has a pretty full menu including a wonderful reserve Rwandan espresso which was amazing on a cool and sunny morning. Gourmet coffee is a wonderful treat, and the Blue Bottle on Sansome is a wonderful way to experience it. The surrounding neighborhood is a little dead on the weekends, but I'm glad to see the living visit this outpost."", ""Oat cappuccino - 4 starsI was hesitant when they told me they swopped their soymilk for oatmilk because of the added sugar in the soymilk. I've had oatmilk before and thought it was terrible. This changed my mind about oatmilk! The texture was amazing, and it had a rather neutral, slightly nutty flavour. I think I actually prefer this to my usual Bonsoy/unsweetened Silk soy lattes! Now I have to hunt this oatmilk down...Drip coffee - 3.5 starsTo be honest, I can't tell the difference between this and other drip coffees I've had. It's definitely better than the ditchwater drip coffee you'd get at a 3 star hotel breakfast, but beyond that I can't quite tell.Chocolate chip cookie - 2.5 starsVery average. It was soft and didn't have a memorable flavour."", '*Tempted to give 3.5 Stars*Solid coffee - they have oat milk here!! Loud, crowded, no wifi with people hogging tables scheduling business/personal meeting after meeting and students coming to study here. Limited seating as is, yet Blue Bottle is a classic and people are willing to wait in long lines & pay $5+ for smaller-than-normal sized coffee. Good place to sit at the window and people-watch. Was honestly reminded of a bar/happy hour scene here. Everyone standing around chatting, super loud, casual, walking about, etc. Cute merchandise on display. Clean restroom across the hall.', ""It's no secret that Blue Bottle has great coffee. I recently tried their Hayes Valley espresso, and I am now a solid fan too. Not to mention that this location is super beautiful with a art deco feel to it. It does get busy towards the end of the work day, so plan too find another place to sit!"", ""Blue bottle was my first coffee love when I first moved back to the bay about 6 years ago. Blue bottle taught me to appreciate a GOOD cup of coffee. Upon my first visit to Blue Bottle, my close foodie friend introduced me to drip coffee and encouraged me not to add in the syrups and creams and really appreciate the true flavors of the drink. I was shocked, mind you that my previous coffee go-tos were always the sweet flavored drinks from Starbucks. Funny how your taste buds can change overtime... Trying out Blue Bottle elevated my spectrum of coffee, but then again, maybe just being in the Bay Area does that to you anyways. It's true, SF peeps are coffee snobs and like their good coffee! Blue Bottle has always been consistent with quality and taste. Their flavors are really strong so I always love getting a latte to add in the creaminess from the milk. I also adore their HOUSE MADE LIEGE WAFFLES. 5/5 stars for sure. They are hot off the press, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, with just a touch of sweet caramelized sugar goodness. This location itself is great. Tall ceilings. Spacious seating. But beware the line can get pretty long in the mornings. Ordering moves quickly but it may take ~10+ minutes to get your coffee."", ""My baby brother Calvin recommended we meet here for post-lunch coffee (on me, apparently, even though I also brought him a fried chicken biscuit and apple fritter donuts from The Bird). The line never ceased (even at 2:30 PM, it was a serious wait), so I hope everyone who works here makes six figures.Sarj enjoyed his liege waffle (hot off the presses - I know it's an iron, calm down) and although crowded, the place affords good people watching. The lemonade is made with sparkling water, which is refreshing, but if you're not a fan, you can always get Lemonade south of Market."", 'A must in San Francisco. Beautiful location, friendly staff, modern decor. This is a step above Starbucks and the brews are great! \xa0They offer all the usual coffee options with focus on creating a beautiful cup of joe. Super good with dietary restrictions, and they offer quite a few different milk options. Worth a stop for a beautiful and delicious cup of coffee! \xa0This location is particularly pretty set in the lobby of a gorgeous building. The mosaic floor is a treasure!', ""Really great coffee! I've been here a couple of times and it never disappoints. Sometimes there is a wait but it's worth it. The best thing to do is to get your drink to go as there is usually very limited seating and it's always full. Sometimes there is also a wait for your drink, especially if it's the afternoon on a weekday. I love the latte and cappuccino, but need to try the pour overs as these also seem good!"", ""As always the coffee is amazing so they always get the 5 stars. Location wise, it's good, it works for SF. Lines can be long, so the wait for the coffee can take a bit of time. \xa0So not my favorite location to go to all the time if I want to relax. Although they've made the lines faster and more efficient since my first stop here 6 years ago. Limited seating and always packed. There's some great seating along the windowsill for those going a la carte, which is a plenty in SF. \xa0Convenience is key. Also the lot of land is larger than some of their other shops."", ""This place was incredible and a perfect little escape in the middle of the busy streets of San Francisco! It's a great place to sit down and catch up with an old friend! I ordered hot chocolate and even it had latte art on it! I was super impressed! The next time I stop by San Francisco I will be back!"", 'The coffee here is seriously THAT good!!! \xa0I have heard lots of raving reviews of this place and it definitely lives up to its reputation! The service was super friendly and quick! I ordered their New Orleans iced coffee and it was fantastic!

Piccolo Petes Cafe,"[""French toast was great, they were out of original. The almond French toast was the best option, though. Don't be fooled, they say they give you a couple sticks and syrup but it's more than enough for one person. The almond French toast is croissant styled bread with almond filling and toasted almonds. The Littles toast is more of a sandwich; you have the option between one or two eggs with/without siracha. The bread they used for it was really good, not too heavy with a garlic aoli! All in all, great mom-and-pop stop! Don't plan on eating inside due to how small the space is, but was worth the stop!!"", 'A charming, cozy little hole-in-the-wall coffee shop. Really cozy. As in, there are two tables in the dining area, and the entire space could fit within a decent-sized master bedroom. Nevertheless, it is a great place to sit down and have coffee on a quiet Sunday. My sister and I decided to have brunch and coffee here one morning; we read over the short menu of food items and were excited to try the King Kong Toast - a toasted sweet bread with hazelnut spread, topped with bananas, walnuts, and condensed milk. The coffee was nice enough, and the toast tasted as good as it looked (can you ever go wrong with bananas and Nutella?). My sister probably summed it up best, though: ""Delicious, but I probably could have made it myself.""Overall, an endearing little café with friendly service, definitely worth a stop if you\'re in the area.', ""Such a cute little hole in the wall Family Owned Cafe! I have lived across the street from Piccolo Pete's for almost a year now, and today finally had a little time to check it out! Service was quick and friendly.We ordered: Mr Fancy Pants toast - garlic, olive oil, Brie Cheese, mushrooms, and honey.SO SIMPLE. SO GOOD. Seniority Coffee - pretty good tasted like Mexican hot chocolate, can't complain! Cafe is suuuper small and only has 2 tables inside so prepare for to go orders!"", ""Great breakfast food. Very unassuming place given its location, but it's definitely worth checking out. The breakfast little is a great breakfast sandwich (egg, bacon, cheese, garlic aioli, sriracha sauce)."", ""This place is a really awesome low-key neighborhood spot. When you come upon it you wouldn't expect much but they make really wonderful food and they have really great coffee. The owner is super nice and the staff is really warm. The space is a bit small so I would say grab what you want to go but if you're lucky you'll find a table. They just opened a second location, can't wait to check it out. Last time we were here the homeless guy came in asking for help. So we decided to offer our cup of coffee as we waited for our purchase. And the owner overheard us and treated us to a drink which was really awesome and nice of him. One nice gesture lead to another. Super pleasant experience."", ""This place is such a hidden gem! I took my mom here for breakfast and I'm so so glad we went here. We ended up getting the Breakfast Little, \xa0Senorita coffee and the original French Toast. Parking:We ended up parking just behind the shop - free parking so eyy Food: Wonderful. The food was simply delicious, though simplistic. The coffee was one of the best coffees I have ever had - and I've had plenty of coffee in my lifetime.The space is quite small - just a warning. But my mom and I were lucky enough to have gotten there at the right time to have gotten a seat. It wasn't too busy as it was I believe 8 in the morning on a Friday morning..not sure what time they usually get busy...but the lady and the guy that were there were super nice and ahhh the overall place was just so cute!"", ""On our way to the Dicken's Faire we stopped here for breakfast. Delicious food and Mexican coffee was spicy and tasty. Very small place with only two tables, but seats outside. They seem to do lots of take out, they are fast and reasonably priced.

(Totally by accident because I missed my weekend morning CalTrain bus to Bayshore station, so i had to take a car to the station) I love it! Super cute cafe!!! Total hidden gem in SF!

I got the spicy Mexican mocha ( it's spicy- you have been warned if you're sensitive) and the Mr. Fancy pants (mushrooms, honey, garlic, olive oil, and toasted cheese- absolutely delicious)!!! I will be coming back!!! I will go out of my way when I commute to try this place again! P.S. I found out they own the restaurant Breakfast Little on 22nd st. Never been there, but if this is even a hint of that, then I'm so down!!!!!"", ""Good tasting and strong coffee is definitely my cup of joe. The Bf and I came on a Saturday afternoon (right before closing) and the baristas were kind enough to with up an ice almond milk latte for myself and an ice coffee for the BF. The total came out to a total of $7? Which for SF prices is a steal. My latte was bold and strong. Just the way I like it and the Bf enjoyed the ice coffee ( though a bit acidic for me). Looking on their menu they have a nice selection of fancy toast to supplement your caffeine. However, seating is limited and the location would be more of a grab and go kind of joint. Nonetheless discovering this place is a god send in the neighborhood as there aren't too many cafes around the area--at least none that offers non-dairy milk options. Oo! They also accept CC now and if you get a chance, try their freshly made frescas. It was amazing."", ""Everything in addition to what I already stated: They recently had their 4 year anniversary (October 6th) where they invited everyone to come by and connect with the Piccolo Pete's community. They had a great DJ who kept the jams playing, complimentary drinks (I think there was a strawberry ginger and something watermelon), and they were serving up toast + sandwiches + cafe drinks the entire time. Alsoooooo, I finally had the French Toast! I opted for Cinnamon and it was perfectly satisfying. Light and fluffy and still filling but not to the point that you feel guilty or ready to be rolled out the door! Peep the pics ;)Still my favorite spot!!"", ""Such a great little coffee spot. Only two tables inside, but it is nice and cozy. The drinks and food are always on point. Whenever my sister is in town, she has to get her Senorita here. It's cinnamon goodness. I personally like the Mexican mocha. Love the french toast but they only have it on the weekends (I think maybe Friday too?). \xa0The breakfast little sandwich is good, too. This place is a little on the pricey side, but it's definitely worth it."", 'I live in the surrounding neighborhood, so this is my ""local"" cafe as you would say because it\'s literally the only decent cafe within walking distance that I would enjoy going to!Super quaint, and friendly staff. You always run into the same people who work there which is nice, because it feels more like a small town than the big city. I\'ve tried a few different options there. They have rotating fresh juice in the mornings until they run out. It\'s usually some type of fruit like raspberries, and an herb like mint, or some unique combination. I\'ve tried the coffee, they have a Mexican mocha I believe which was fantastic!I heard they grind all the spices fresh which is the bomb. The food was amazing too! I\'ve tried the French Toast Croissant. AMAZING!Price is pretty comparable to most indie coffee shops. I do it once in awhile when friends visit my hood.

Small local business - I love supporting small businesses and it\'s in my neighborhood!2. Ordered the King Kong Toast, which has a tasteful combination of fresh bananas, nutella, condensed milk, walnuts, etc. The dish itself was prepared really well.3. The ambiance of the place is nice, you can tell the owner and staff took effort in decorating and keeping the place neat and cute. There are mini potted succulents by the window and you feel like you\'re eating at an outdoor mini patio4. There\'s a ""Piccolo\'s"" sandwich shop right next door attached to the cafe. The cashier told me they often refer customers over to each other, which is a great way to build rapport and develop customer base. It also definitely opens up the variety of food available to a customer.5. Staff was friendlyThe Bads:1. Uhm, did I just pay $8 for a slice of fancy toast? Yes. Yes I did. Even though on yelp they\'re listed as one ""$"" sign. Felt a little deceived... esp also because if you compare past pictures of toasts to mine, the sizes look much smaller now. I was surprised how little I got for $8...2. They have the heat on way too high. And during summer in SF when the weather was like 65-70..?? I was trying to enjoy my breakfast while trying not to focus on myself sweating 3. Pretty limited menu: different toasts, coffee, and that\'s mostly it. Menu item prices for the toasts also have been up about $2 from the older photos on Yelp. A simple toast runs you $5-6 and a more flavored one $7-9. The portion size is pitiful, too. All in all, great food presentation and taste. I understand that small businesses probably can\'t afford much space due to high rent, and I could ask staff to turn down the heat. So not counting those critiques: for me it\'s still not worth the price. Why pay $8 for fancy toast when I could probably get a full meal like Ike\'s, ramen, or burrito for $10-11? Won\'t be back unless I\'m rolling in dough', 'If you have already heard that San francisco is the home of $4 toast...get ready, this place has $9 toast!Don\'t get me wrong I was way into it - enough to drive 20 mins to the edge of SF to get there.The place is teeny tiny, two tables that seat two peeps, and some outdoor benches.There is a very limited menu, about 5 kinds of toast, a breakfast sandwich, a few kinds of morning brews, and 5 varieties of french toast (the french toast, as I discovered is really different kinds of croissants turned into french toast, and only 1 croissant per portion, so not a huge portion). I had the Ham & Cheese french toast, which was yummy. My man had the toast topped with brie cheese, mushrooms and honey (quite tasty!)Our total for the french toast (aka 1 croissant, ""frenched"") 1 toast with toppings, 1 large chai and 1 large spicy mocha) was $26, so that is a pretty penny.Less than 5 stars for 2 reasons: the chai was very milky and very little chai tasting, and the total price for everything.SUPER happy I made it to this place that I had bookmarked for years, but likely will not be back.', 'This little place is as yummy as it is cute.

Contraband Coffee Bar,"[""Addicted! I came here once before last year, ordered a latte and enjoyed it- wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Came back here last weekend on a cold and rainy day with the hubs- I insisted it is a great spot per reviews, and I shared my personal past experience was pleasant.The staff is a little intimidating, but we went forward and placed our orders. He ordered the Bhakti chai and I am almond milk latte. Much to my surprise, when we received our orders I somehow had an almond milk Bhakti chai- and it was the BEST mistaken order! The chai was creamy, slightly spicy and perfectly sweet! We loved it so much, we made a second stop that evening for a second round.The taste of that chai lingered with me all week, so I made my way down again, this time, per recommendation, ordering the pirate matcha chai. This was definitely more spice. The chai was overpowered by the matcha, but it worked well as I walked home through the cold. Would I order it again? Probably not- I'll stick to the Bhakti chai :)Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!"", ""Coffee takes way too long and is not good enough for the price. To add to it, the staff is rude to customers. For a $6 cup of small coffee, one would expect some kind of decency. Asking questions or trying to figure out how to pay when their register isn't working is met with hostility from the staff.When their management is informed of the problems with their staff, they respond just as rudely, if not worse. They insist the problem is with the customers, not their staff, seriously, what the fuck?Save your time and money and go anywhere else, their coffee isn't worth it."", 'I found Contraband just before going to brunch with my date.

AMBIANCE&SERVICEDespite the cool hipster vibe of the coffee shop, the workers seemed so uninterested and intimidating. No welcome, no ""hi""s, just waiting to take your order. The cashier took our order, said ""That\'ll be $9"". I handed him a $50 bill, he dismisses me, turns around casually talking to his coworkers for a few minutes, took a group shot (of espresso maybe?), finally turned around and took the $50 bill from my hand. He returns my change with $10. I corrected him to say ""Oh, I gave you a $50 bill."" He returns the correct amount of change with no sincerity and a nice classic eyeroll. The interior has one large community table with limited amount of energy outlets. The music was obnoxiously loud- hard to have a normal conversation or study. The chai tea was just okay- nothing I would come back for. Prices seem pricey for the amount you get. Highly recommend this place getting new workers that like working with people. Don\'t work in the customer service industry if you don\'t like people- simple as that.', 'Super hipster coffee spot with lots of natural light. It\'s small, but there is enough seating for about 25ish people so the space is pretty functional. I liked the display of pastries and unique offerings such as a spiced matcha and a turmeric latte ""golden milk"". I tried the steeply 6$ golden milk, spicy and creamy at the same time. 4 stars for free WiFi but I saw only one outlet?? Wtf. Get an extender maybe?Oh, and most of the seating is elevated so it\'s sort of a diy standing desk if you so choose!', ""There are only TWO OUTLETS HERE in the whole place hence only three stars. Other than that it'd be a great place to do work out of. Cozy coffee shop with good service and lots of natural light. It's small so it fills up quickly. I tried the rosemary and sage latte drink and guava piloto pastry and both were very good. The rosemary and sage were an interesting mix that surprisingly worked. The pastry was warm and crumbly. Overall I won't really come back because I like doing work out of coffee shops and even though I like the small outdoors seating, the lighting inside, the fancy coffee machine, and some of the plants, the lack out outlets and large communal table just really turn me off from Contraband."", 'Cute coffee spot that is quiet and clean. A little sterile and lacking personality though. GF and I came here for a tea date. Baristas were nice. We both had the Bhakti chai tea latte.

It tasted very smooth and now I want to go back and try everything else on their menu! They had succulents all across the long table in their coffee shop and a really cool art wall behind it.

Will definitely be coming back!"", 'First time coming in with high expectation because every time I passed by Contaband it was packed with people. I ordered a pirates spicy green chai which is a very ordinary green latte. \xa0The milk foam was cold and it took up to 1/4 of the cup which it not as worth it for a latte like this.

I came by here every morning for a latte or cappuccino and every time irritating country & western music was being played.

The little snack I got was a black bean empanada, filled with good spices and had a really great crust! There is seating outside, which I opted for. Inside was filled with tall counter/tall table seating and your girl is little! Be careful sitting out there, it is SF the weather will change and you might not be able to sneak back inside!

I was shocked - I was charged $7+ dollars, and it was literally just a splash, and had never been a problem before. The man (gruff, stocky one with white beard) person working, who I assumed to be the manager, made a comment about emailing the staff to make sure it was never done again - and they lost a loyal customer in doing so. Also, if you get a drip coffee...half the time they don\'t fill it up and you\'re left with a huge gap. $5+ bucks for a drip coffee and not filled up?

Not the best, but certainly not the worst considering it was made with almond milk. However the sage rosemary syrup is very potent, and there was way too much in my drink. This made the whole cappuccino taste bitter and unbalanced, since it completely overwhelmed the coffee flavour, and honestly isn't a great pairing. I've had these kinds of herbaceous additions at other coffee spots that were done much better, and provided a subtle enhancement as opposed to a palette blaster like this was.

Philz Coffee,"['This Philz coffee is located in the cute quiet neighborhood of Noe Valley. I came in on a weekday and ordered the Gingersnap coffee, it was my first time in. The coffee was rich and had a very authentic taste, I definitely recommend it. The staff there is friendly and the location has ample space for large groups and offers easy access for curbside \xa0parking. I will definitely be returning and recommending to others.', ""Main differences between this Philz and the other ones is that 1) extremely family friendly with a play corner for children, 2) street parking isn't too bad, and 3) tends to be semi-full (most likely because it's family friendly and not bring your laptop and work)Service and drinks are the same as other Philz locations. I usually come here if I'm going to just talk and hang out with a friend or two. I tried once coming with the intention to work but the children friendly corner was too much of a distraction for me."", 'Stopped in a few times for a break in the afternoon, it is busy but plenty of seating even during the lunch rush, love their toasts, though this location does not currently offer the cinnamon sugar toast which is my fave. I liked the set up of this location, since the space is long and narrow there is a ton of seating (and variety of seating types) along the wall facing the bar, and this makes it welcoming to singles jus wanting to get off their feet and sip a coffee for a minute, or two people could also find tables and two-toppers to sit together comfortably. Noice level is quite high I think due to the narrow space and popularity of this location. Staff is courteous, I called in a few times to clarify hours and ask what they had on the pastry menu and everyone I spoke to was polite and positive.', ""This is a solid neighborhood-oriented Philz outlet that serves the same large variety of yummy coffee drinks as other busier outlets. The coffee here is of the pour-over variety, which takes a while especially during busy periods, but at least you know that your order has been custom-made for yours truly.Folks who gripe about how long it takes to get an order fulfilled are missing the point: good coffee shouldn't be rushed. If you want something fast, go to 7-Eleven or a humdrum convenience store and see for yourself how the quality suffers."", ""You need coffee? \xa0They make it pretty good here. \xa0They also have a few breakfast items in the bakery case. \xa0Pick a barista and s/he will help you out!The register is by the door, so to get in line, you need to walk down to the end of the shop. \xa0This location has tables and seating if you want to get some work done. \xa0There is also a restroom in the back. \xa0Parking is limited to free street spots. \xa0They don't have a parking lot, so I see a lot of people walk or bike here."", ""What I like:- their coffee. Always gives me enough caffeine to do my work What could be improved (only applies when I stay to do my work/hang out):- loud music with strong bass. Not great for someone trying to focus on her work. - not enough chairs/tables for the amount of customers that come to do their work. So I would say there's enough seats for 20 people max. The last few times I came, there are consistently 12-16 people here working on their laptops."", 'This is an awesome Philz location. I would go out of my way to come here. I love the Mission and everyone should come here. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, they recommended a drink with no attitude.

BTW I think this was the original Philz?', 'THIS LOCATION! \xa0I drive for work, so I visit many Phil\'z locations. \xa0This one is my favorite. \xa0It\'s the only one without the ""cool kids"" vibe. \xa0The employees at this location are friendly and warm and helpful.That\'s not to say everyone at all the other locations are too cool to be nice to you, but that\'s often my experience and put me off Phil\'z for a long time. \xa0Now I spend shameful amounts of money there.', ""We were staying at an AirBnB nearby and I was so excited when I found out that a Philz coffee was only 2 blocks away. I first tried Philz about 5 years ago and was blown away by the Mint Mojito, so I vowed to return when I came back to San Francisco.Now that Philz has expanded in this city and beyond, and I am happy to see that the integrity of their coffee has been preserved. I wanted to try something different so I selected Jacob's Wonderbar, and it did not disappoint. The barista takes your order and brews your coffee fresh from their selection of beans. You can also ask them to add cream and/or sugar.My coffee came up pipping hot, and it was pure coffee ecstasy. It was exactly as described: flavors of dark chocolate, smoke, and nuts.

I also received the wrong drinks as I explicitly asked for iced drinks not hot. When I asked if they could change it to ice, they made a remark that I was never told them that and that I asked for hot. The employees need an attitude change here.', ""A great neighborhood spot for coffee. It's got a good feel to it. Whenever in the area, Philz is my go to spot for a morning coffee. \xa0The staff is nice and the coffee is good and strong. \xa0It's a place where you could catch up with neighbors and just read or work. \xa0On a Friday morning I saw a number of parents gearing their kids up for school with a coffee and a toast. \xa0There's a kids reading area as well that my daughter's enjoyed as I enjoyed a very drinkable cup of coffee. \xa0I had a dark roast and the kindly staff asked about the sweetness and cream level. \xa0Sweet and creamy was my choice and it was just as I envisioned. \xa0I really like how the temperature of the coffee is instantly drinkable since why would anyone want to burn their mouth drinking boiling coffee? \xa0Philz gets it on coffee.

They have a little kids corner in the shop for families.Great place to study, I spent a few hours there today.Guy at the cashier's stand doesn't know how to control his volume or direction of projection. And the content if it all, not disturbing, just excruciatingly trite."", ""This is a great local Philz coffee in the Noe Valley area. It's kind of far out from any major public transit stops or big destinations, so it's less crowded and not as much of a wait compared to say, Philz Castro or any of the downtown ones. There's still quite a few people who come to hang out and work, though I've never had a problem finding seating. Same great flavor Philz roasts - my favs are Jacob's Wonderbar or Philtered Soul. On more than one time, I did get a weakly brewed batch that wasn't per usual Philz potency so knocking off one for the inconsistency."", ""Okay what the heck... Philz does not take cash. I won't be back just for this reason. There are other great (better and more inclusive) places to get a good cup of coffee. Not taking cash automatically excludes people who want coffee but don't have a card or phone app attached to a card. It's discriminatory. No Philz, EVERYONE DOES NOT use plastic or the cloud for every tiny purchase. Kids, especially teens, poor people, undocumented people, minimalist people, people who live paycheck to paycheck, elderly people, homeless people... basically anyone who lives a life cash ONLY. This sucks"", ""Introduced to the mint iced mojito coffee. So happy I was. It is so good! The minty fresh flavor brewed fresh once order was definitely an eye opening event. We don't have Philz in Vegas but I had been told about this coffee place in California a few times. I am happy I finally got to try it. Next time I'm gonna get the Tesora. The need to explore the coffee world is now upon me :)"", 'Very cool little location with lots of coffee options! Most are pour over which takes a little more time, but definitely worth it! They do have a ""mobile order"" section for those who wish to call in early and just pick up their items. In addition to an extensive and epically curated coffee selection, they have a equally long list of pastry items as well. Be careful with the parking situation as there are very few spots open, and there are signs that warn against double parking and parking in red zones as you will be towed..', ""I love Philz but this 1 star review is just for this location. They are SOOOO incredibly slow. I have given them the benefit of the doubt by coming at times when they were busy and not - yet somehow regardless of how many people are in there, it takes them close to 20 minutes to toast a bagel and put some cream cheese on it. SMH. They have also messed up my food order multiple times which I let go and don't bother getting it fixed bc they'll probably take too long. Honestly go down a block to 24th and diamond and eat at diamond cafe. Their food is excellent and comes out super fast. FYI - Philz on order ahead app doesn't have all their food options listed."", ""The service here is friendly but too slow. \xa0I have a 30 min lunch but it's not enough time to walk over order food and return. \xa0I should probably use the online system.""]","['5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '3.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '2.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '3.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '1.0 star rating', '3.0 star rating', '4.5 star rating']"

That alone should be 5-star-worthy, because he is very hard to please :-) Nice bonus point: It\'s right next to the Castro Theater and they were nice enough to let us bring our hot beverages into the cinema (because we are adults and can be trusted with handling our coffee and tea around velvet chairs)!', ""I've never gotten coffee here. Unbelievable, I know. After all, I've bought the chocolate-dipped appendage on a stick that I lustfully yet respectfully dubbed Mandingo at Hot Cookie, wolfed down the overaccessorized wieners at Dapper Dog, and attended the most essential sing-alongs at the Castro Theater. Besides, I'm a Philz guy who becomes a creature of redundant habits. But I had never been here until I found myself in the Castro early on a weekday morning with a few minutes to spare before a medical appointment up the street.What deterred me is the claustrophobic space and the number of tourists and regulars who venture in but don't seem to come out. On this particular morning, it was almost empty which allowed me to get a pleasing 20-ounce cup of the Hawaiian Royal Kona coffee for just $2.15 (photo: bit.ly/2PJ1Nsg). It gave me a gulp of the tropics before my EKG and motivated me to come back to buy a bag of their beans. They spotlighted at least five different types that morning which I presume they rotate.

Here's a list of the places I've tried and visited: bit.ly/2MD7Kcw"", ""First off, the place smells AGGRESSIVELY like coffee. I know it's a coffee shop, but I first just wanted to point out the strong scent of coffee attacks you as you walk in. Secondly, the place is very cluttered. It doesn't appear to be very organized and is a bit messy, however, the food and drink that can be purchased at Castro Coffee Company still do hit the taste buds in a positive way. There weren't as many tea options as I had expected, but nonetheless, if you don't care about anything else in this review, they make a good cup o' joe."", ""I was just walking down Castro and WHAM! The aroma of coffee smacked me right in the face! I couldn't resist a hot cuppa joe on this chilly night. So I popped into this cute tiny coffee shop jam packed with coffees and pastries. The guys that attended me were friendly and polite. I had a drip coffee ($1.62) and an apricot bar ($3.25). For drip coffee, it's self serve by the door with 8 to choose from. Refills are like a buck twenty five. Unfortunately, I didn't like anything I bought here. The coffee tasted artificial AF. (Bourbon Pecan is the one I chose). And the Apricot Bar was awful; too dense, not at all sweet...like whatsoever, tasted only of dried apricots and nothing else. Canned sodas are $1 ...so that's good cuz I was thirs tyy"", 'Great coffee place. The staff is Great!! The coffee is inexpensive and there is always a sale going on.

The people working don't make conversation but are always nice."", ""Every time I come to San Fran I always make sure to stop by here! I first came across this place a few years ago when I was having difficulty finding blended (frappe) coffee in San Fran. The shop has a lot to offer, many different types of coffees, syrups, beans, and pastries. I love their blended drinks. Tried a hot mocha once and have tried their pastries a couple times, they were good. I like how they have a little bit of seating outside. It is good to able to sit down and eat your pastry quickly especially if it is sunny. On my last trip to San Fran the smoke was making me so sick it was a blessing to be able to sit down for a bit. The people who work here are nice and are good at making sure the line doesn't back up."", ""I'm not a coffee gourmet, but I'm always giving them as gifts. \xa0I didn't want to buy stale old gourmet coffee for high prices at safeway, so I came here asking for strong but great tasting coffee and the owners were very helpful & knowledgeable- their coffee choice even impressed me along with their spinach cheese empanada!!! Their shop is tiny with only 3 small tables outside so intend to buy your coffee and pastries to drink as TAKEOUT. \xa0But once you know the coffee you like - mine was the Barbary Coast Reserve 1 pound ground for $12- then you can just go in and out and enjoy it at home or work!! \xa0They also have their website you can google where you can order the coffee to be shipped to you if you already know what you want so no having to leave home!!I'd definitely come back!!"", 'I love this place.

I love that there\'s a huge selection of coffee pumps and that they change daily so you can really sample all the wonderful variety of roasts and blends this place carries. I personally prefer a medium or light roast so I get more caffeine to balance my heavy cream. There\'s always at least two choices, one Latin American and one usually African.

So if it's a weekday, or \xa0weekend evening consider getting here some way that does not involve driving or be prepared for a quarter mile park and walk. If it helps there is both a muni station and the a street car stop not quite a block away.There are three or so patio style metal table/chair combos outside if you feel like having your coffee on site, but there is no inside seating and overall this is more of a walk in/walk out kinda place.Decor is what I'd describe as San Francisco utilitarian. The building itself has been here forever (it used to be the Castro Cheesery-but even under that name it was till a coffee place.) and has that settled well used look. The counter is dominated by every kind of coffee the world has to offer in bulk glass displays. While there is also an extensive selection of teas to chose from there are more then a hundred different types of coffee bean in stock. That's all pretty awesome but there's more. The baristas on deck have some mad coffee skills. This is easily one of the best espresso spots anywhere. The manager (who may also be the owner) on scene is turkish and well, he's forgotten more about what makes a great pull then most mortals ever know. If espresso is not your thing this place also puts out godlike latte's \xa0cappuccinos and the like. As you might expect there is nothing wrong with the basic coffee's either and at 2.50 for a meduim-ish it's the total bargain choice.But wait there's yet more awesome goodness here-the pastry counter. When you get up to the cashier section to pay for your drink and some beans (Hey, you're in line anyway. Why not?) there is amazingly tempting treats in a display case. If you need something more breakfasty then the mouth pleasing petit fours/truffles/things covered with sugar and oozing cream/almond paste/marzipan/whatever the croissants are the way to go as the bagels and burritos are just ordinary. Not bad mind you, but not anything to come just for either. Avoid the malt balls though-nobody orders those really and the ones on display have been there a while.So while this is not the best spot to break out the laptop and pretend to work while secretly checking everyone out, this is one of the best high quality, local, quirky coffee spots in a city filled with excellent quirky coffee spots."", ""No over the top here fancy words here, just a great cup of joe that comes at a great price compared to other coffee shops in Castro. \xa0The shop is so small, but they've got your standard drinks. \xa0They also sell coffee beans too if you need some for home. \xa0I ended up with a latte which tasted great, no sugar necessary and not too bitter. \xa0Great stuff."", ""Exceptionally good coffee, exceptional price. Many whole bean options (I grind fresh at home each day), and REAL authentic light roasts. If you are a real fan of light only, you know how medium is often passed off as light.

Whereas other high end roasts are 10-12 ounces, and are priced anywhere from $16 to over $20....If you have a cup of brew from the store, it is not an individual pour over made for you, it's from a pump canister. THAT SAID (because you know this could be not so great, in all reality), yesterday I went in for the 1st time ever, at 3:30 pm, when you'd *expect* that to be less than fresh. I pumped out the VERY LAST cup and it absolutely tasted just minutes old. REALLY GREAT COFFEE. Meaning that, at that late hour, they obviously turn over the product too fast for it to sit long. Also, that cup of amazing coffee was only $1.65 for a small.EXTREME BONUS: among the cream options is heavy cream. I can't really do coffee with half and half-it's just not the same.

First, seating is limited, and you can't lean backwards on any of the cushions near the windows without stressing your back. Second, some of the pricing is misleading. Santa Cruz offers you different prices for different sizes but here, the menu at the counter only displays one price for certain items--the larger and more costly size. I'm sorry to say I won't be returning and will instead drive to Santa Cruz. (April 2019)"", ""Ahhhh the epitome of the hipster cafe with minimal space where you're forced to either uncomfortably stand with a sliver of table to work or cuddle with the stranger next to you as you share the only table in the entire space. My favorite! Other than that, love the vibe haha. But really there's not a lot of space and you really have to wait for a spot or just idk leave? I didn't try their coffee as I was all caffeinated for the day. I definitely will be back though! I love this area and it's right near Dolores Park. I would just recommend you come early to snag a spot or come superrrr late like when they're closing lol.OK UPDATE: I totally lovedddd spending my afternoon here. I applied to what seemed like all the jobs listed in the Bay Area and read Michelle Obama's new book! A+! The place starts to clear out around 5pm so if you're looking for a spot then without waiting, that'd be the time!"", ""Great place located at the corner of Market and Church. I love the big windows, wooden panels, plants, bright, and cozy feel of the space. They have free WiFi and tables \xa0for you to read and do work. \xa0The coffee and service is great, of course. There is also a bathroom for what happens after drinking coffee ;)I had a cappuccino with hemp milk (they don't have oat milk here), and my boyfriend had the one&one which is basically a machiatto with an extra shot of espresso. Will definitely be back."", ""Love this place for doing work, reading a book or just catching up with friends. First off, it's one of the few places that has oat milk as the option. Second, their food options are great! I had the biscuit with a poached egg and my friend got the avocado toast, and both tasted amazing. Pro tip: grab a corner seat and curl up on a rainy day!"", ""I'm not a coffee drinker at all, but needed something to wake me up on my morning walk. The space is aesthetically pleasing with a lot of natural light, which freshens up the setting. They have plenty of plants instilled around the sleek countertops --very neat space and design. I just had a cup of Chai with Almond Milk ($4.25) to-go and was on my way.This isn't the best place to study or work though as there isn't too much space though. On the other hand, great to people watching as it's situated on a corner with floor to ceiling glass windows all around."", ""A cozy little coffee shop to get some work done! We came here on Black Friday after hopelessly calling a bunch of coffee shops in SF looking for something that's open. It is a small spot close to Whole Foods/Safeway on Market. You can either sit at a table or one of the couches (tables were taken when we came at ~ 10:30 am). They have both WiFi and an xfinity hotspot so you're covered! I haven't seen any outlasts though :/The design is a combination of old brick and wood. It reminds me of New England more than anything. I love the amount of natural light offered by huge windows. Definitely bringing a book next time!We got a latte, a chai, and two cookies. The drinks were good quality even though a little pricey. I found the chocolate cookie a bit overwhelming, but the poppyseed one was great! The avocado toast ($9) was actually very delicious and bigger than what you'd get for the price at most places. Overall, the ambiance is what really seals the deal for Verve. It's perfect to work or read a book on a rainy day!"", ""Verve Coffee Roasters is a small, minimal space that offers your typical coffee options as well as some nice light food choices. My boyfriend and I stopped here one morning during our visit to SF to fuel up for the day. I ordered a latte and a piece of quiche, and he got a pour over and the daily toast, which had ricotta and plenty of greens. The guy at the counter was super friendly, helpful, and patient, which was\xa0refreshing as I find sometimes the customer service at places like this can be lacking. The pour over came with a little card that includes the variety's flavor profile notes, cup characteristics, producer, region, process, and cultivar. I'm not a coffee snob by any means but I still thought this was cool. The latte was your typical latte, creamy and delicious. My personal favorite part of our visit was the quiche. When I ordered, I was informed that the slices are served at room temp and asked if that was okay, which I really appreciated. The quiche was so intensely creamy and rich that it almost felt more like a dessert, which sounds weird but it was packed with flavor from the salty bacon and so decadent. Definitely not an every day option for me but a nice vacation treat. The daily toast was just okay, not a whole lot of flavor and I thought it could have used more seasoning. Overall I enjoyed our stop at Verve and would go back in the future, or if I lived nearby."", ""Literally the most poorly run coffeeshop in SF. Spend your money anywhere else. You'd probably get a nicer barista at a gas station."", 'I have walked by Verve Coffee many times. I decided to visit today and try something. It\'s a different cafe with its own concept. It\'s minimal, but there\'s some different coffee drinks. I saw Americano and espresso, and that didn\'t appeal to me. I saw something called ""One and One"" and thought I would try it. It was an espresso shot and a macchiato shot. The macchiato shot was creamy and a small shot of coffee. The espresso was very sour and you had to drink it fast. This cafe is modern and comfortable to hang out in. Compare it to Philz, which gets on my nerves. My drink was $4. I wonder if I will be caffeinated for the rest of the day.', 'Their bowl of soul is my all time favorite!!! I recommend it with the English Breakfast tea. The shop itself is also very cozy and lovely - a great place for working / studying / meeting with friends.', 'You might not think of this place for tea, but you should !!! If you get it for in house, over the next hour you can get it steaped again. Definitely a popping place with great service, too.', 'Verve is my favorite coffee ""chain"" for espresso based drinks. I was so excited that they opened shop in SF after having only been able to have it through third party shops and when I visit LA. The space is gorgeous (convenient to get to via public transport) and the drinks were solid. Price is typical for California. It was also super busy when I visited so not much space and there was never not a line at the register. Note, this location is NOT idea for studying/working for the many reasons below:No accessible outlets throughout - just in one locationSeating is very very sparse throughout the day but very cozy corners in the back and plenty of standing spotsFree wifi but how will you use it when you can\'t really sit anywhere?Baristas are friendly but when I went, getting a cup of water after the initial order was hard (not sure if they usually have a water station)-1 star for the store itself - I wish they were much much bigger with much more space to even sit down and chat with a friend - but a full 5 for the drinks :)', ""If I'm not mistaken - and I often am - this is Verve's only retail presence in the city, and it's a prominent spot at the much traversed corner of Market and Church. Most of their cafes are in Santa Cruz, where co-founders Ryan O'Donovan and Colby Barr base their operations, and Tokyo of all places, where I think I saw one of their cafes in Shinjuku. In other words, they may be Blue Bottling toward Starbucks territory but there was no evidence of racial profiling yet at the Castro location. Just more of a preference for them to serve the local hipster populace from what I could tell from their droning chatter.I suppose I should have gone for one of their coffee specialties since they appeared to have all the shiny hardware necessary to prepare them (photo: bit.ly/2JkpKSO). However, I was in the mood for tea on a blustery day when I was a bit on the forlorn side. I went for a $4 cup of their Rooibos which was advertised as having elements of caramel and nectar and being 'bodied' whatever that means. I waited patiently for the barista to prepare it from a jar of loose leaves, and the result was smooth and, well, 'bodied' (photo: bit.ly/2Hl167X). There is seating in here, but good luck with that as the laptoppers lay siege to the space. In response, I was off on my merry way.TEA - 4 stars...a particularly smooth Rooibos can be sipped hereAMBIANCE - 3 stars...ah, to be young and self-entitledSERVICE - 3 stars...tersely pleasantTOTAL - 4 stars...probably helps to express some nerve at Verve"", ""I consistently have a great experience here. The service is outstanding. Friendly yet unpretentious. The vibe is local with a mix of friends meeting friends, first dates, people working, and people getting a quick drink. It's also a great place to people watch. Menu is more traditional with brewed coffee, cold brew, espresso drinks, and tea. I would highly recommend the pastries that are sourced locally. Or the made in house food. The menu is small, but has some great healthy options."", 'Was ok drinking my coffee when suddenly a frigid strong cold draft starts blowing on me and does not stop. I asked an employee to turn it off or do something since its 8am and why any SF restaurant would need AC on?! He came back with a pathetic lazy response saying it has to do with temp outside and blah blah they didnt give a hoot about my discomfort and annoyance.

This places sucks!!!', 'Decent lattes. Had a new barista working on our drinks. 3 of 4 lattes were overflowing the cup. Although the coffee actually tasted good, there was no need to over-pour 3 of 4 drinks. Rookie mistake I guess?Good coffee. Decent vibe. Lousy seating (dumb mini wooden tables.. or are they chairs?)Great spot to grab coffee on the go, but not a great spot to just chill.', ""Verve has been one of my favorite coffee experiences on my latest trip to SF.The aesthetic of the cafe includes large windows on most sides and awesome use of lines, light wood, and touches of teal. Love the pop of color. Simple and effective. The counter is long and gives the coffee a front-and-center placement. Not a crazy amount of seating but does include a small communal table and benches and low tables, allowing the coffee culture to shine. It's really a unique space.I went for a Gibraltar, which is espresso plus a splash of warm milk. (It's like a mini latte!) A bit pricey but definitely satisfying and delicious. The barista offered to add more milk orvchange the temperature of milk if we wanted. Not sure how he would have done the latter, but he obviously cares a about a customized cup.There is a small but ample selection of sweet and savory carby foods.

My third visit here and I brought my husband to grab a coffee and do a little work/reading. I was pretty excited to come back and show him this cute spot, but unfortunately had a ""lesser quality"" of an experience than before. The woman who took our order today had zero patience with us and zero warmth, which was odd because we just got to the counter. We couldn\'t tell if she was giving us sass or just naturally rough around the edges, but every interaction with her felt like we were inconveniencing her day despite it not being busy.She seemed annoyed when I wanted to clarify the price of our two coffees, then forgot to give us one coffee so I had to ask her male co-worker. She yelled for us to get the second coffee at the counter when I noticed her co-worker dropped off food and beverages he took orders for to tables. When my husband asked for the wifi he didn\'t quite hear right and went back and she coldly said ""It\'s right here. Look at it."" and walked away to the back. On top of that, I couldn\'t help but note she never asked if we wanted our order to go or not, and she didn\'t ask if I wanted my pastry heated up like I got last time I was there (which I loved!). We got our coffees in to go cups and my pastry in a bag automatically. Everyone else at tables had lovely ceramics--perhaps she subconsciously wanted us to go from the beginning. :]', ""I have found my favorite coffee shop in San Fransisco!

There is just such good energy in this coffee shop, Aesthetics very crisp and welcoming, the service is amazing, and the coffee is so wonderful especially on a nice sunny day. A lot of their pastries are pastries you would not find typically in America. I had one of their soft boiled eggs with muesli and it was very delightful. It's also very quiet inside and you can do a lot of work inside if you need to. I just love all of the German decorations as well. There's something so nostalgic about this coffee shop and if you are in San Francisco, I highly highly recommend eating here. The next time I come, I want to try some of their German dishes.

I was pleasantly surprised to find a spot out front, and a not so busy restaurant inside. I ordered the original ""Jacob"", which I really loved.

I don\'t know if it\'s stigmas against me, or that Philz has really gone downhill over the years, or Philz employees are just snooty, entitled hipsters. Probably all the above. This is probably one of the newest Philz, in one of the most rapidly-gentrifying parts of the city. When I last went to this Philz, it seemed like 100% of their customers and employees were snooty, tattoed, extremely stylish Millenials in their 20s and younger. City College area just gets more bougie and gentrified by the day. Just a few short years ago, that area was still ghetto, cold, sparse, and uncool - what a mere community college area should be like. But with the opening of Whole Foods, and the resultant barrage of hip businesses and expensive housing - the City College area has gotten to be as snotty hipster as the rest of the city. Well. A while ago, I politely asked the cashier for a restroom code, and before I was able to finish my sentence, she angrily muttered the code - as if to slam it in my face. I get that ""cattle"" tone and subhuman treatment constantly - but it\'s even worse at hipster elitist places like Philz. Um, I\'m more Philz than any of you - I\'ve been to Philz ever since they opened in the mid-2000s, and to every location in SF, and I\'ve tried all 12 of their coffees multiple times each. I\'m so much more fully Philz than any of you - and you dare think I don\'t belong, stick out like a sore thumb, and deserve the most demeaning, contemptuous treatment?Another time I went, I was digging in my tote bag for my wallet, and the hipster cashier rudely kept tapping at the counter - even as I profusely kept apologizing for keeping her waiting - for like 30 seconds. The disgust and disdain for certain unattractive Asians like me is everywhere, and extreme, uncalled for, and absolutely unacceptable. At every table and sofa at Philz - all the snooty trendy Millenials avoided eye contact with me completely, and if they happened to see me, they gave a disgusted look and quickly looked away, like they saw the most lowly thing on earth. Remember, I started going to Philz, all their stores, enthusiastically, long before they ever had coffee in their lives. Who\'s more Philz - me or them?The coffee I got the last time I went was pretty bad, too - so undrinkable, I thought of throwing it out after a few sips. The only saving grace for Philz is that they do purport to hear about your complaints - though I don\'t know if they actually take action after hearing my complaints. I don\'t know if they actually try to train staff to always treat ALL customers with the same amount of warmth, fairness, and respect. It\'s an unwelcoming, rude place for Asians who look older and fobby - and I\'m neither old nor fobby (I\'m US-born) - but that\'s how I\'m adamantly seen, treated, brutalized, and excluded.', ""3.5 stars. Coffee is pretty reliable as most Philz goes, a fantastic abundance of outlets and a decent amount of seating. Good location with good food selections nearby, and parking is not too bad with Whole Foods across the street and a fair amount of 2 hr street parking. BaristasThe bathroom is the main reason I just can't give an excellent review... Horrid. Literally always reeks of urine (probably because the toilet doesn't have any water in it at baseline, but really God knows why). Paper towels and toilet paper everywhere..... frequently out of toilet seat covers. Whyyyyyy Philz!?!? You are a coffee shop.

This particular Philz is pretty big and there's plenty of space to sit and do work or chat with friends. So as mentioned, I always get their mint mojito even though I pretend to think I'll try something different. It's hard not to get mint mojito whenever you're at Philz, the next best thing is to probably buy a bag of Philz coffee for home use. You order first, try your drink and let them know if it's perfect for you, then pay. Generally, I try not to make them remake my drink more than twice cause you know, don't be wasteful. So if you ever find yourself in need of a study cafe, Philz is a great option."", ""A very cool hang out/study spot near CCSF. Great \xa0music selection- 90s r&b, early 2000s, todays hits.

It has a minimalistic feel to it which I digged - bright, open, and airy.I ordered the latte with soy milk and a chocolate chip cookie. The latte was very enjoyable! It had a nice sweetness to it, with a good amount of \xa0covering of hot steamed milk. The chocolate chip cookie was also delightful.

It was created by a barista at one the Ritual SF shops. It was alright. You stir it up. It had a cherry kick with cold coffee and ice. It was interesting and $6. I have nothing better to do than amuse myself with SF cafe creations like the ""cherry bomb."" Well, keep on inventing new drinks and people will try it.', ""Cute little spot on Market Street.

However, they're not very big yet. I hope they stay this way. Nothing worse than getting bought out by Nestle or another large corporation. I'll completely stop buying their coffee like I have with Blue Bottle."", ""Yes, Ritual is one of the better coffee chains in SF. They are experts in the craft. I must say, the folks at this location are also a bit pretentious. I asked if a specific drink could be iced, and the guy pretty much scoffed at me. Cool. Generally, I found the menu a little short, and the food items weren't as enticing as other similarly-calibrated coffee shops. But I'd be happy if this was my local spot.My husband's seasonal dandelion latte, which had a special chocolate in it, was very decadent and nice. I ended up getting the daily drip, which was fruity and a good pick me up.Tiny location with a few spots to sit for a few minutes."", 'If you enjoy good coffee, friendly staff and an occasional sweet treat this is the place for you.

Macchiato is pure magic, and my standard drink (soy latte extra hot extra shot) is reliably balanced and generally mind-blowing. Even their ""brewed and ready"" drip coffee is good! I haven\'t tried their cold brew, but I heard it is super strong and tasty, apparently they brew it double strength for 16 hours(!) so that it doesn\'t get diluted when they serve it over ice. Smart.The vibe in the shop is cool too. The music is always something good. The baristas at this location are pure gold, and by that I mean they are very talented at their work, obsessive about dialing in the perfect cup, and also are just sweet, kind, and quirky people. They got hella pride -- most of the baristas are queer, they have lil rainbow and trans flags stuck in a cup of beans at the door, and their own special Ritual rainbow logo is painted on the wall and printed on t-shirts! (I bought one.) There is a big bench to sit and chat or read, but the place is just too small for tables or laptop-working. Enjoy interacting with your favorite human!

It's a decent-sized boba shop with a couple of tables and a U-shaped bench for seating. I had my eyes set on the matcha toffee and my boyfriend was curious as to what drinks he should try. I mentioned that their creme brulee is one of their popular drinks, so he decided to order it with boba. He couldn't adjust the sugar for this drink, but it was actually not too sweet. It's rich and has bits of the creme brulee pudding & caramelized sugar in it. He pointed out that the boba was a bit on the hard side, though.The matcha with oat milk is really good with 50% sweetness (75% is their default, I think). They use Jade Leaf Matcha and you can tell that the quality of the matcha is creamier than most. Unfortunately, I wish I could taste more of the toffee flavor. There was a huge clump of it on the bottom of my drink after I finished it. Maybe I should have a) stirred it more thoroughly and/or b) order with less ice?

However, I still don't think I would have enjoyed it in my drink.I got the house milk tea with oat milk and the creme brulee as a topping (no hard sugar, just the custard), and it was really good! The milk tea had a strong tea flavor, which is what I always look for, and the custard inside my tea made it really rich and creamy. Their creme brulee custard is also made in house, which I really liked.It had a simple yet aesthetic interior, good for studying or 1:1 milk tea dates.

Their boba was so soft and chewy and I loved the sugar they add for the crunch that usually comes with an actual creme brulee. Best to drink it fast though since the boba does get hard quickly. I still have some credits left so I'll be coming back soon to try some of their other drinks. The atmosphere inside is cute too!"", ""close to home.simple and convenient for me whenever I want something to hold in my hand while I'm walking (unless if you let me hold your hand or your girlfriends hand instead).I change my mind, .. actually I'd rather hold the cup of unsweetened matcha tea with grass jelly than your girlfriends hand.no drama, no nagging.simple joy.thank you very much."", ""It's pretty average as far as boba places go. For $4.75 not bad, though it is incredibly tiny and cramped in here. I got a Jasmine Green Tea milk tea with crystal boba, which was pretty nice though nothing that made it stand out to me. My friend got a Creme Brulee milk tea drink, which was surprisingly incredibly filling, and tasted like actual creme brulee in a milk tea cup.I wasn't incredibly impressed to be honest. I guess one of the main selling points for it is that it's probably the only boba place located here in Hayes Valley."", ""Urban Ritual is probably the best place to get some quality boba. Although in San Francisco, on of my usual go to is Boba Guys, it is safe to say that Urban Ritual definitely TRUMPS Boba Guys. I'm surprised I didn't review this place a while a go but there is no doubt it gets my 5 stars in a heart beat. I don't usually go out to Hayes Valley but I do come to this boba shop specifically because my friends and I love it so much. This is like a hole in the wall boba place because I feel like not a lot of people know about it. At my most recent visit, I got the Lotus Flower Bomb.. and boy was this BOMB! This was a specialty drink (and possibly seasonal) so I'm not sure if it's going to be around. In the drink is a mixture of Grapefruit, Lotus flower, & Chrysanthemum tea. All of my favorite things in one cup! This is just such a refreshing drink, you can't go wrong with it -- especially if you like grapefruit. You know the quality of the drink is great because there are even little particles of grapefruit and I can literally see the workers grab fresh tea leaves.Boba is also a big factor of how I decide if I like a boba shop. This place is ON POINT. I've been disappointed by so many places where they just use day old boba (or that's what it tastes like) but at Urban, I can actually taste the yummy squishy boba that is really what fresh boba should taste like. Overall, quality trumps everything in my books and this place has got it! 10/10 would recommend to anyone and this place should get more attention it deserves."", ""Overall 3/5:Not the best drinks you can get in SF by a long shot. Their drinks were refreshing, but the flavors weren't anything that popped. Drinks:- Matcha Toffee 2/5: Ultimately, my girlfriend and I didn't finish this drink and there were a couple reasons. We couldnt taste the toffee and matcha, which somewhat defeated the purpose of the drink. The drink basically just tasted like whole milk. - Bae-sil 4/5: Thought it was a little bit watered down, but I enjoyed this drink a lot more. The strawberry flavor is definitely the most prominent in this drink, and the basil adds a slight freshness. I don't really think their tea was all that great considering I didn't taste any tea flavor. The crystal bobas I added in complemented the drink nicely."", ""Cool boba shop located in Hayes ValleyI love how diverse their menu is and they offer a great selection of drinks.Seating is pretty limited. They get busy so not enough seating for a lot of people. There are a couple tables and then next to the window are some bench like seats.Parking is pretty horrible in this area. Only street parking in this busy place so good luck finding parking. Customer service is fast and friendly. Prices are decent and they also offer a great check-in offer for yelpers; 1 free topping which is awesome. Drinks that I have tried are house milk tea and creme brulee. Creme brulee was quite interesting but overall not my cup of tea since it was way too sweet for me. However I really enjoyed the house milk tea which I got 30% sweet, highly reccomend! Overall it is a great quality boba shop that is definitely one of my go-to's now."", ""Going to be a new ritual going to Urban Ritual! With so many boba shops in San Francisco, let alone the Bay Area, it's really hard to innovate something that already has a strong following. But...Urban Ritual is pretty damn good! With so many different ways to personalize your drink, there are so many combinations to choose from. First of all, the menu is pretty simple. You can either create your own drink with the following options:Tea: Early Grey Black Tea, Matcha Green Tea, Jasmine Green Tea, Honey Oolong, White Grape Oolong, Thai Tea, Hibiscus Herbal Tea (non-caffeinated), Chrysanthemum Tea (non-caffeinated)Milk: No Milk, Dairy, Additional $0.50 for Oat, Pea, or Macadamia Nut milkSweetness: 0/30/70/100 - None of that 120 percent sweetness BS that other boba places offer Toppings: Honey Boba, Crystal Boba, Aloe Vera, Lychee Jelly, Creme Brulee (Additional $1)Or One of their specialty drinks - which have creative syrups and strong herbal flavors to the mix. In the past couple times I have been here, I have created my own with oat milk and found it to be super creamy. I also love that they offer drinks without caffeine. Out of the speciality drinks, I suggest the Bae-Sil, Strawberry Milk Bar, or the White Grape Yuzu. They ran out of white grape when I came last time and they substituted this for Peach and I found it more sweet and fruity and hope they would keep this as a permanent offering! Since there are so many ways to personalize your drink, \xa0it might take a while to find the perfect drink for your liking. To solve that problem, they had a few samples in the front and the staff was super accommodating and allowed me to try out any drink combinations I was skeptical about. The owner David, who also worked the cashier, was extremely humble and welcoming. I learned that he used to be a nurse and decided to finally follow his passion of opening Urban Ritual. It's a risk doing something like this, but I am so happy he did it because Urban Ritual has become one of my go-to places! Located in one of my favorite areas, Hayes Valley, I can't wait to keep coming to Urban Ritual."", ""I really hate to give such a cool place only three stars, but my order unfortunately didn't live up to the hype this place has been receiving.Let me preface this--I love boba. Ever since I moved to SF, I realized just how few good, reasonably priced boba shops there are within arms reach in the city. This is something I took for granted in suburbia. So when I found this place, I was so ready to love it. I tried the creme brûlée tea with added creme brûlée pudding and pearls. It wasn't bad for the price, and the order came out pretty fast. Conceptually, the drink is pretty cool. It comes sprinkled with that burned/caramelized sugar crumble on top; when I mixed the drink, however, the texture was kind of odd. There was this delicious pudding--which honestly saved the drink because the tea itself was almost tasteless--but the textures clashed and it felt weird to drink. Silky pearls, gooey pudding, and hard sugar... it was kind of a lot going on in just one drink. Every sip without the pudding just tasted like water.Maybe I'll have to try this place out again, but I wouldn't go out of my way if I wasn't in Hayes Valley."", 'I love the matcha toffee here! Great matcha flavor and the toffee bits are a unique add in. Their drink options are cool, some traditional that you would see in any boba shop but some fresh that more unique like the creme brulee or yuzu oolong. I definitely want to try everything on the menu.Creme brulee pudding is amazing and always worth the extra dollar (imo).', 'Ordered the creme brulee as a Friday treat on a sunny San Francisco afternoon. Man, did it hit the spot!Who would have thought to blend creme brulee into milk tea? I mean it makes sense - egg pudding is one of my favorite traditional toppings (which is what originally piqued my interest) but wow. The additions of small bits of custardy creme brulee and torched sugar bits was amazing...!But what really put it over the top for me was the boba. It was cooked to the right consistency and scooped in WARM. I only know of one other boba shop that does that and trust me, it does make a world of difference.So hurry, get yourself a drink and cheers!', ""I ordered the strawberry milk bar and it was fairly pleasant. It tasted refreshing yet really sweet at the same time. I liked the unique taste. It's quite reminiscent of the strawberry syrup at iHop. Atmosphere was cute, vibrant, modern, and bright. Just a little small since there was only 3 tables and a seating area in the corner. Cashier was really nice too!"", ""Wow. I've never been steered so wrong before, but my goodness, Urban Ritual was a terrible choice for boba. Ready to be blown out of the water, I dragged the hubby to Urban Ritual, located on a super busy street in San Francisco (although, what street is never busy?). The parlor itself is boring, but it has one accent wall with their logo and name. The menu is also extensive, having a few specialty drinks and another list of flavors so that patrons can concoct their own.I decided to get their house milk tea while the hubby got The Cloud, a cold brew coffee drink that was advertised to have notes of dark chocolate. Prices are typical, but keep in mind that the cups are downright tiny. However, in our case, we didn't mind the small size because we ended up throwing our drinks away anyway.The house milk tea was hideously bland. If I let it sit on my tongue for a bit, perhaps I could taste the notes of black tea, but it was honestly just water. The only decent aspect was how smooth it was. As for the hubby's drink, The Cloud was just bitter and boring. Yes, the coffee flavor was strong, but there was no creaminess to it and definitely no dark chocolate. It was just a boring iced coffee.Perhaps we chose the wrong drinks. Perhaps we stopped by at the wrong time. But there's one thing we know for sure: we aren't coming back."", ""I don't care how many times I need to circle around this block and the adjacent areas for parking because I know that when I find parking... I can hit Urban Ritual and go two blocks on Laguna to grab a scoop of honey lavender from Salt & Straw.I'm so grateful that Urban Ritual hasn't, to my knowledge, tried a take on a strawberry matcha latte because that's really one of two main reasons I go to Boba Guys (it's the SML and their Duke of Earl Grey). The quality of UR's drinks in terms of taste and presentation is leagues above the chains (e.g., Sharetea, T4, iTea, Happy Lemon) and I'm actually frightened they'd eclipse Boba Guys in my heart, haha.So far I've tried the Creme Brulee which has spoiled all other creme brulee adaptations at every other boba spot I've gone to. You actually get that rich, custardy goodness AND the caramelized, slightly burnt, sugar topping, too. I also really like their Forever Young and White Grape Yuzu if I'm craving something non-milk based and fruity. I'd say the WGY is a much lighter flavor than FY; FY may be fruit-based but it's pronounced. Wonder what that would be like with real sangria...Props to UR for their specialty drinks and special ones to the person who did the hand lettering on their menu boards - beautiful job!"", ""I wanted to like this place, but their boba was just okay. To be honest, I didn't walk in so I don't know the vibe of this place, but based on pictures and their menu selection, this should have been a winner. On a cold Saturday night after dinner, my bf and I were craving a sweet drink and this was one of the few boba places opened later. Sorry, not trying to drive out of my way to Boba Guys. Saw this cute little joint and had the bf jump out and pick up the drinks.I got a Matcha Boba with Oat Milk (trying to copycat my order at Boba Guys). He got the House Black Milk Tea. It was not bad, but it wasn't great either. I forgot if it was the actual boba or the drink itself that was the meh part. So just based on their drinks itself, I remembered I didn't really like it. But maybe that was a one off."", 'ordered the creme brûlée with boba. tastes exactly like it sounds.

It was a cozy atmosphere and there were quite a few tables available to just sit and chat. The interior was clean and decorated nicely.The cashier was patient with us as we were taking forever to decide what to order.

I will be returning to this place :)Only downside is that there's no restroom available."", ""Best Earl Grey Milk Tea I've ever tasted! I'm always picky about my earl grey because honestly it's a hard milk tea to make well. Too much cream and you only taste the milk. Too much tea and it somehow tastes like soap water.

I then bought the Earl Grey Milk Tea at 75% sugar with honey boba, which I enjoyed every sip of! The honey boba wasn't too mushy (a nightmare if it is) and the sweetness of the honey was absolutely delectable.I absolutely HAD to buy another cup for my mom to try because she also loves Earl Grey, and carried that cup gingerly with me all the way back to Milpitas! (The cup saw a 1 hr 30min journey of walking to the nearest BART station, being jostled around on the rickety BART, and the drive back home) Needless to say, my mom loved it too and we'll definitely have it again when we go back to SF.

We really liked the back patio seating.', 'Hipster coffee shop located a block away from Ocean Beach.Been here quite a few times and it\'s one of my favorite coffee shops in SF. Their menu is unique because they offer a drink called ""Snowy Plover"" and different variations of it. Personally I skipped it because I\'m not a fan of soda water!!My favorite go-to drink here is their Iced Mocha with their house made whip cream. Their whip cream is like crack so yummy and fluffy. I usually also ask for extra whip, a must!Prices are you average coffee shop prices raging from $4-$5 a drink. Usually spend about $10 if I\'m with my boyfriend for 2 drinks.Customer service is fast and friendly. In this location they only have outdoor seating, all the way at the back of the store. They also have a nice bathroom which is a plus.Lovely coffee shop to drop by before your day at the beach.', 'Love this place. \xa0Serves very good strong coffee. Staffs very friendly.

Staff are so sweet and helpful. I usually make my way here after a few mile walk and get one of their almond latte's with the brown sugar simple syrup which is very tasty and not too sweet. I still love their apple and sausage corn muffin. One of the few muffins I can still enjoy lol. Glad it's an easy pick up close to home. Gonna miss this place when I move next year. Prices are fair and I always tip. They have dog treats that for some reason my housemates dog can't stand (she's picky and SPOILED) but it's cool they have them. Totally worth checking them out if you're close by. It's nice to have something other than a bar in the neighborhood. I'm kind of annoyed at the choices for morning and afternoon fare in this area. I just wish they had more offerings. I think they'd do really great offering a simple breakfast sandwich and small lunch options since they are open as late as they are. Brownies only take me so far in life LOL"", 'Very interesting special drink...the snowy plover is unusual because of the carbonation, but tasty nonetheless. I was hasty in my ordering and picked without reading the description. My first sip was met with mixed feelings, perhaps due to my own naivety. It took me a bit to truly enjoy the drink, but ultimately, I enjoyed it. The whipped cream on top was definitely delicious. The surroundings were clean, simple, and elegant. My friend and I enjoyed the small outdoor space in the back. It was chilly and a bit damp, but the sun came out and warmed up half of the space. I would come back and love to try their matcha drink.', ""I love the vibe and service of Andytown. The coffee aromas remind me of ritual. It is the quintessential SF coffee shop complete with single brew coffees, $5 toast (mediocre), and specialty drinks (plover). I wasn't a fan of the plover which is soda water and coffee, so this time got the mocha instead. 3.5 stars for the mocha, in which you can really taste the quality chocolate. I wish it was creamier and more chocolatey though. The soda bread tastes like pita and is drenched in butter. The other sliced multigrain is also dense but looked too healthy.

I had cafe au lait earlier in the year in New Orleans and well obviously, this doesn't compare. The coffee is a bit acidic but better than another local coffee joint that we went to the day before.

After posing a few times to help my girlfriend get a nice Instagram photo of the decor, I finally got to take a sip of the drink. It was certainly different than my normal latte from Starbucks. It was very carbonated, but not too overwhelming. The buttery texture of the whipped cream was the highlight especially since we watched them whip it out freshly in front of us.

I opted to try their Yirgacheffe Pour Over ($5), which was super smooth, but had a slightly acidic finish. They roast their beans in the back of the shop, which would be cool if they did a mini tour, or had a display window or something along those lines. Beans are around $14/bag. They also had some cookies available (vegan and non), but no other food options. Parking was easy at that time, and there were good metered street parking spots. I believe there is also one free street spot on the street right before the cafe."", 'Below-the-radar artisanal coffee shop with an emphasis on single-origin coffee from Ethiopia. Their pour-overs are exceptionally well balanced, neither bitter nor acidic (a sign that the coffee extraction was just about right, neither under-extracted nor over-extracted). They roast the coffee beans themselves. The espresso we tried was from Columbia. The latte is quite smooth with an earthy/fruity profile, the kind you have come to expect from good coffee baristas. Definitely recommended if you are in the area.The only minus is that it was freaking cold in there. The building is an old warehouse of sorts, I guess not very well insulated and not well heated.

Little Sweet,"[""This. IS. My. FAAAAAV Boba in All of SF right now.Especially the White Gourd Milk Tea. Oh. Goodness. Please. Just try it once. 25% Sugar, less ice with either pudding or boba. It's the bomb I've had Boba's all over SF and in San Jose, but as of right now, I think I would say, it is the best in SF.I have tried their Pudding Milk tea, it was pretty good as well, but I will recommend the White Gourd over it.Honestly, it's too good to the point that I've been coming back 3 times this week.. day after day... that the lady in the shop remembers what I get now The price is your average boba, but parking might be a little struggle.There are a few parking in the front, which is usually not open though - unless you're lucky.The store is quite small, with few seatings.. and so far always clean.Definitely a must try!!! \u200d"", ""Little Sweet was a stop on my way to dinner. I ordered two drinks - a regular milk tea for my man and a White Gourd Milk tea for me. When I went to order I told the guy taking my order I don't really like sweet drinks so I wanted to go for 25% sweetness for my White Gourd Milk Tea. He said the drink isn't that sweet and told me 50% would be not sweet already, and I hesitated and he said 50% is the best since they basically water it down to tone down the sweetness so it won't be sweet. So I agreed for 50% sweetness with his reassurance.For toppings, I asked about white boba - like was it the type that's crunchy, bouncy from other places like agar boba? He said the difference was that it is cooked vs uncooked and that he would not define any of the boba toppings as crunchy or bouncy. I was thinking...why would I want to eat uncooked boba aka tapioca starch balls!? Turns out it is NOT uncooked boba - so do not be alarmed since he wasn't good at describing...After I ordered and tried it in my drink I can confirm that it is actually the clear agar boba balls that is offered at other places. I tend to prefer it to actual boba since it is less sweet and has a smooth bouncy crunchy texture - hard to describe but that's what I would say. PS: If you don't like sweet drinks - DO NOT ORDER 50% White Gourd Milk Tea - it is waaaay tooo sweet despite his reassurances - tastes like 100% sweetness. White gourd lovers - we knowww that the drink is sweet already - so I can't imagine what actual 100% tastes like. If you decide to come here maybe opt for 25% sweetness if you have tastebuds like me! The other order of milk tea was decent but nothing to write home about. Would I come here again? No. But if you do, I hope you get a more helpful person taking your order."", 'Pro:Variety of flavorsGood sizeGreat quality of tapioca, chewy and warmEgg waffles also availableThai ice tea boba was delicious, not too sweet.

One drink was inexplicably much sweeter and had 3x as much ice as the other one.Hard. Pass.', ""I am giving Little Sweet 2/5 stars because we waited 25 minutes for our bubble tea after waiting in a slow moving line to order, and it was just ridiculous. We went at 1:30pm on a Sunday for reference. Unless you are prepared to wait that long (which we weren't), I would not recommend coming here - no matter how good the tea is. That being said, the tea, the slushy and the boba were all really good. I also thought the size of the teas for the price were great. The boba tasted fresh and there was almost too much of it which is always my favorite."", ""I've been coming here for years and it never disappoints !!

Super small store with a community table and couple tables.', ""Longest line I've ever seen and longer wait than boba guys which makes no sense.45 min - This is the longest I've ever waited for boba. I'm still waiting right now but I can't imagine non dairy milk tea to significantly blow things out of the water.--Just got the boba. High mountain tea and white gourd (winter melon) tea at 25% sweet. The high mountain is insanely bitter with very strong tea flavor. I can't even taste the milk in the milk tea. It's non dairy but it tastes like full blown iced tea on steroids. (think Chinese medicine level bitterness) The white gourd is pretty good and I would order it again. \xa0It has a unique flavor and it is creamy. Either way, this is 45 min I'll never get back in my life. Please, please, please hire another person in the back. It shouldn't take this long to make two drinks when most of these items are premade."", ""My favorite boba spot in the city. I can't believe I kept passing up this place even though I live a block away. The white gourd milk tea is my go to drink. White gourd is a winter melon and it is very refreshing to drink on a hot sunny day. I have never had something like this before. It is very unique.My second favorite drink here is the high mountain milk tea. This is a little sweeter so I recommend getting it at around 50-75% sweet.The day time worker here is very friendly. She always helps me grab the straws and she gets me drink made in a fast and timely matter. Night time workers are okay but that's because this is when it is most packed."", 'Oooh, I like. Ordered the Guan Yin milk tea with fresh milk. Was pretty tasty - good balance of flavors although more heavy on the tea. Price was reasonable as it came in a pretty big cup. Wait was a little long - think they only have 1 (?) or 2 (?) people back there, and there is a backlog of drinks. Not much indoor seating but I would return.', ""I thought the place was quite decent - had a lot of options with various toppings. Came around at noon and it wasn't quite as packed as some of the reviews I read claimed to have experienced, so it wasn't a negative aspect of my visit.

Good boba does not do that.Will not be returning.', ""If it seems like I've been going to a lot of new boba shops lately, you're right. Moving to the Bay has meant trying out each tea store on every corner, and I am showing no signs of stopping.For a place called Little Sweet, there's a big crowd and a big menu. But after the week prior's burn with Tancca, my significant other and I decided to go back to our usual drink orders: Thai tea with honey boba and a salted cheese tea. (I still chose to mix it up with some high mountain tea, because I hadn't seen that in a while.) We got to the front of the line and our teas fast given that there were half a dozen parties waiting when we walked in. Part of the delay was that someone ordered a paper grocery bag full of milk teas. Hey man, you wanna be my friend? Anyway, it's pretty cool of them to do bulk orders like that. It would be a great spot for an afternoon office catering trip.The drinks are decently sized for the amount paid. It's on-par as far as the price goes, but I think the quality is in the upper echelon of boba shops in San Francisco. Their tea is strong (it definitely kept me up that night) and the drinks themselves aren't too sweet. I'd say a 75% sweetness level is perfect for me here because I like mine on the sugary size.The only thing I didn't like about this place was the menu formatting. Instead of having prices in a tradition $X.XX format, everything was done up in two-digit decimals, confusing me at first sight. There's also an asterisk and exclamation point legend that makes me feel like I'm doing mental gymnastics when trying to figure out whether my drink is caffeine free.Also, they charge extra if you want your drink without ice, which is annoying. I haven't tested it so I don't know if you actually get more drink with it, but it sounds nonsensical: paying more to get less."", ""Love when I find good boba spots!My Taiwanese side makes me such a snob when it comes to boba, I get so picky about it. But this place really impressed me. I tried their Brown Sugar Milk Tea with an adjusted sweetness of 75%, which is the highest level of sweet I'd get for my drinks. I loved how my drink came out not too sweet because I was still able to taste the strong aroma of tea. The boba pearls were also cooked to perfection! I don't even bother going to places like Quickly's because you can easily tell how low quality it is compared to here. There was only 1 worker making all the drinks, while the other person was working as cashier. So kudos to that hardworking lady for making my drink bomb! \xa0There was a line though, so hopefully they have more workers."", 'This has been my go to spot in SF for milk teas and boba. Imo this place is highly underrated and is a local spot for boba connoisseurs who prefer strong tea flavors in their drink. Everytime I come here staff has always been welcoming and accomondating. Drinks are always consistently strong here which i prefer. If you prefer sugary milked down drinks go to the many other boba places scattered across SF. Just recently I ordered their sweet potato fries and my friend dropped them all over the floor. I told the barista and she kindly said ""it\'s fine I\'ll clean it up in a bit. Do you want a replacement ?"" I offered to pay for the 2nd batch but she refused. This was during a busy Friday to where she was handling other people\'s orders. Wow such courteous here. Gives me more reason to be a strong supporter other than their solid drinks Only gripe about this place is every time I come here street parking is a hassle. Though I can\'t blame that on the business.While my bae of boba and MT is Tiger Tea down south this is my bae of boba in SF hands down #1', ""I went here with 2 friends around 3pm and this place was packed! I was surprise how crowded it was, but that's ok since a big crowd means the boba must be good! I got the brown sugar milk tea, my friend got the honey milk tea, and the other one got the high mountain milk tea with icecream and another drink because he couldn't make up his mind. It seems like they only have one size for drinks here because all of our drinks we ordered were quite big.I thought my brown sugar milk tea was good. It wasn't too sweet and my boba pieces were chewy and had a good flavor to it. I've noticed that not all boba places marinate their boba with flavor, but it seems like this one does. That is a huge plus! The boba here isn't very hard like a few other boba places I've been to in this city. It as perfectly chewy, without being too hard or too mushy. The only downside about this place is that it's a very small boba place without many places to sit."", ""I ordered their passion fruit green tea and they had the best boba! It was the perfect amount of chewiness and sweetness...but it had something crystallized in them? Not sure what it was, so it did throw off the texture. At the least the taste wasn't affected!

Breadbelly,"[""Inconspicuously tucked away in the Richmond district is this delicious coffee and pastry shop. Looking for parking on the weekend is rough but if you're willing to walk a couple blocks it's not too bad by Park Presidio for free street parking. Clean, modern atmosphere. Order at counter and grab a seat at the table. Pricing is comparable to any good coffee/pastry shop in the city like Mr. Holmes. Had the Iced 50/50 and kaya toast. The drink is delicious , half coffee and half black tea sweetened with condensed milk. Reminded me of Hong Kong milk tea, flavor was perfect not too overwhelming and definitely refreshing . I had to google what kaya meant since I never heard of it, apparently it's a popular Singaporean item. It's made with pandan and coconut milk - very smooth and not too sweet. Bread was crispy on the edges and soft on the inside. Yummy! Will have to go back and try other items in the future."", 'The kaya toast is sooo good. It\'s a fresh baked milk bread topped with coconut and pandan jam. Extremely heavenly! I also got the Moscavado Cookie which has coconut, sesame and moscavado sugar. It was okay but I would not recommend it.I was a little disappointed because the breakfast sandwich they had on the menu didn\'t have the scallion jam, instead it had fermented chili. And they were out of their not-ube tart because ""sweet potato is out of season"". Two items that I really wanted to try but couldn\'t. One star off because I got a pretty weird vibe from the workers (except the girl, super friendly chick.) The guy who was standing at the cashier area had his back turned the entire time to make drinks and avoid customers. I felt his cold shoulder vibes the entire time I stood there trying to decide what to get. The other guy who brought out my toast handed me the plate awkwardly. He handed out forks and knives to everyone else (who ordered the toast) except for me. Strange...', ""Great Service and even more delicious treats.Got the following items: instagram.com/p/BwoDj7Bh…The Kaya Toast is probably what's everything to rave, colorful, instagram friendly, and delicious.My only hang up on this place is, I wish the seating was a bit more comfortable and a bit more outlets. But of course, you have to strike a balance because you don't want people to camp at your spot all day like a Starbucks.Cheers, keep up the great work!"", ""Yay, I'm their 100th reviews!!!1) Do yourself a favor an get their Kaya Toast. It's UH-MAZING!!! 2) Char Siu Sandwich with their glazed sauce and roasted pork was delicious an great to share with others. 3) Anko sticky bun was so so for me. My least favorites. 4) Cucumber and avocado salad had great texture & crunch. 5) Friendly and accommodating staff. Definitely will come back to try other things on their menu. I hope you give this lovely place a try. Cheers! The simple things in life."", 'I\'ve been to Breadbelly a couple of times, and the food is really good, and really pretty. I can see why it\'s popular with those who are active on Instagram. The food they offer is Asian-influenced. I really like the pandan toast, which is a coconut spread. Pandan is popular in the Philippines. Because it\'s a vibrant green, it\'s really pretty in pictures. Another delicious snack offered is their curry, which a fried dumpling with chicken curry inside. I\'ve also tried their sticky bun, butter mochi, and the ham/cheese ensaymada. Out of the three, I really enjoyed the ensaymada. The cheese and ham are sprinkled throughout the pastry, so you don\'t miss out on any ingredient with each bite. The sticky bun was good too, preferably warm. \xa0I didn\'t like the butter mochi much. Since the space is small, it gets crowded fast. When I wanted to dine in, the employee said I could ask one of the single diners if they don\'t mind sharing a table. I was eyeing a table to ask, but after I paid, that diner left. The women next to that table took it, and said their friend was sitting there. So I ended up eating at one of the small counters they have where you have to stand. By the time I was done with my ensaymada, their ""friend"" still hadn\'t shown up. \xa0Most of their patrons are locals, who definitely take their time, which is fine. But I find the rest of their patrons, tbh, annoying, and so I plan on going back very early in the morning to avoid the crowd, and to get a table.However, the employees are very, very nice! They\'re very welcoming and are happy to talk to you about the menu and answer any questions you have. They are pricey, but it\'s high quality and you shouldn\'t miss out.', ""I'm a big fan of Asian pastries and when I found out that Breadbelly was finally opening their own restaurant/cafe, I HAD to go. What originally caught my attention was their Kaya Toast. I absolutely love pandan flavored anything and kaya is pandan in a sweet spreadable form. The fact that it was spread atop a fluffy piece of toasted brioche bread sold me. I wanted it. I also wanted to try their porridge but my friends were against eating at Breadbelly for lunch since the lunch menu is limited and on the pricier side for the portion size. So... we settled on ordering almost every pastry :) Kaya Toast: Fluffy brioche topped with a THICK layer of kaya jam. While it was delicious, it was extremely sweet and definitely something to share with others. Aesthetically it looked great!Not Ube Tart: Maybe my favorite! Not surprised since there's purple sweet potato inside. The tart crust was buttery and flakey, the sweet potato filling wasn't too sweet, and the meringue + salted egg yolk shavings added lightness to the pastry. Good use of textures and flavors!Brown Butter Mochi: Chewy like mochi, dense, and of course, buttery. It was good but I wouldn't get it again. If you like butter mochi or haven't had it before, try it!Ham and Cheese Ensaymada: My least favorite and only because I'm not a fan of savory pastries. My bf liked it, I think it was his favorite. I recommend it if you like savory pastries and think the flavor combo is interesting. Choco-Soba Ko-Cookie: Tied for favorite with the Not Ube Tart. I know it looks like a double chocolate chip cookie but it's different! I believe it's made using buckwheat flour (soba), making it a little earthier and sososo good! I would definitely get this again. Persimmon Satsuma Almond Cookie: The cookie base is a butter/shortbread book probably made using almond flour/almond extract? I really enjoyed the dried persimmon in the center. Kinda like thumbprint cookies! Not a must order but still worth trying. It makes me so happy when new bakeries pop up making traditional Asian pastries/flavors more appealing to people who might not have tried these flavors before. The pastry chefs at Breadbelly make their creations tasty and flavorful and combine flavors that aren't typically combined and they become pretty pieces of edible art. I'm a fan! And I'll be back to try their non-pastry items :)"", 'The kaya toast is wonderfully fluffy, served warm, and is ""not too sweet"" when you get the right ratio of coconut pandan jam in each bite :) I enjoyed the not-ube-tart but wouldn\'t go out of my way to get it again; I ordered it knowing full and well that I wanted taro, not purple yam, but then again... it\'s in the name.Really friendly service. I appreciate the option of coffee or beer - it\'s kind of hard to find a cafe/bakeshop type of place that\'ll serve alcohol, so Breadbelly really hits the mark. Perfect for breakfast, brunch, or just a snack. It looks like the neighborhood\'s welcomed Breadbelly with open arms, as there\'s a line out the door in the mornings. When I\'ve stopped by around 1:30pm or so on the weekends, there\'s hardly a wait and plenty of tables to choose from.My favorite things, hands down, are the savory options. The breakfast sandwiches are fantastic! I like the char siu sandwich (so tasty, with homemade bread), but the price point comes in a little too high for what I feel like I can satisfy at dim sum.', ""Finally, kaya toast makes it to SF! I'm a huge fan of kaya (been eating homemade kaya toast since I was a kid) and so was initially skeptical of the toast at Breadbelly. It looks a little neon green, but it's surprisingly delicious. The bread is thick, soft, and slightly salted--and the kaya is sweet. For anyone who doesn't know what kaya is, it's basically a delicious, dessert-like coconut and pandan paste. I'd definitely recommend trying it at Breadbelly!I also tried the sesame horchata, which tasted like black sesame milk with some cinnamon on top. Next time, I'll be back to try the brown sugar mochi with peanuts. Cute interior, too! Lots of natural lighting, hipster cafe-like vibes."", 'It\'s great to see a pop-up gain such a following that it goes bricks-and-mortar. Breadbelly\'s founders bring Michelin-starred experience to their new venture, where they serve Asian-inspired pastries and baked goods that are not only packed with unique, interesting flavors, but are also perfect for Instagramming or other food p*rn purposes. The ""not ube"" tart, while quite petite, was dense and subtly flavorful enough to leave a sophisticated impression. The gyeran bbang (sweet corn bread with Korean chili, cheese, soft egg), while also petite, was a slightly more savory way to ease into the morning.None of the flavors will be overwhelming or cloying, but I think this is part of the point. And while you\'ll pay a pretty penny for everything here, you\'re getting items that are meticulously crafted and represent an inspired fusion of cultures and ingredients. Exactly what the Bay Area is all about.', ""I wasn't expecting the kaya toast to be anything special, but it was amazingly. I don't usually like kaya Toast because it's so sweet, but breadbelly's kaya Toast paired with unsweetened coffee is perfect. The bread was so fluffy and buttery. The coffee was strong and had a nice dark roast. The place is a little small with limited seating but if you go on a weekday you should be fine."", ""A few things! location doesn't have the best parking, however. the atmosphere is very clean and neat. i ordered the sesame horchata which was on the sweeter side and thick. definitely had both flavors! i also got the kaya toast because everyone was raving about it. It was a thick soft toast with pandan cream over it. which was powerful in flavor, however was too sweet after a few bites. finally, i got the red bean anko sticky bun. i really didn't like this one. flavor was weird. overall, this place is okay. took a while to get my drink and toast, given there weren't any other customers at the time"", ""Everything about Breadbelly is delightful! The cafe's food is yummy and their ceramic cups/plates are beautiful. We came on a Saturday morning and fortunately there was parking and plenty of tables inside.We ordered their kaya toast, their roasted garlic toast, ube tart, and the black sesame horchata drink. Both of the toasts were delicious. The pandan flavor on the kaya jam was flavorful but in my opinion, there was a bit too much. Ube tart was very sweet. The tart part reminded me of the classic Chinese egg tart pastry- thought it was an interesting twist. Tasted like what you'd expect (wish marshmallow wasn't that sweet). The only downside is that it's kinda pricy. They also forgot one of our orders but they were very nice about it and refunded me."", 'After seeing so many pictures of the Kaya Toast from Breadbelly on Instagram, I was determined to go and persuaded my friend to go with me. We had a lovely time talking and catching up at the cute, cozy cafe, but the delicious treats soon were the only things that were on our minds when we took our first bite. Food:- Kaya Toast--$6My friend and I were absolutely blown away by this toast, and after one bite we were very tempted to buy one more. The toast used Breadbelly\'s milk bread, which was incredibly fluffy, soft, toasted to perfection, and buttery. The coconut-pandan jam on top was pleasantly sweet and creamy, and the flakes of sea salt sprinkled on top cut through the sweetness and brought all the flavors together. A new favorite toast that I will definitely be back for!- ""Not Ube!"" Tart--$7Another well-composed treat with sweet and salty elements, and a variety of textures. The torched meringue on top was incredibly creamy and airy and was the perfect complement to the chunky yet smooth purple sweet potato filling (hence ""not ube""). Shavings of salted egg yolk on top added a unique salty element to balance out the flavors. The tart crust was buttery and flaky too. Tips:- We arrived around 3 pm on a Friday and there was no line and spaces open at the tables. Highly suggest coming in during an off hour to enjoy the food in the store. The plates, interior decor, and brightly painted storefront must be enjoyed!', ""Finally got to try Breadbelly today, and it didn't disappoint. This Asian American bakery started by two Atelier Crenn alums first caught my attention from Instagram, where they were advertising pastry boxes before the actual store opened. Everything is instaworthy, but the Not Ube tart was the stand out item for me. Interior: small but crowded on a Sunday Food: I tried 3 pastries and 2 drinks for $27- Not Ube Tart: The most delicious thing I had here. It's flakey, made of potato, and topped with the perfect cloud of cream and sugar. -Brown Butter mochi: I wasn't a huge fan of this, especially after the tart, and it tasted okay- Sesame cookie: this was pretty and wrapped up real nicely, but it tasted okay too. The sesame flavor is strong. -Sesame horchata: thick and yummy, with full on sesame flavor, if that's your thing. I haven't had anything like it before. I want to come back for the Kaya Toast since everyone was ordering it, but my belly was too full of bread :p"", ""Super cute cafe with good food and completely worth a return visit! Actually left the place wishing I lived in the area, since I would love to make this a frequent neighborhood spot. It's kind of a hipster Asian American trendy cafe? That's the only way I can describe it but it's so so good - a lot of the food here reminds me of updated takes on food I would eat at friends' houses at home. Highly recommend the kaya toast (coconut pandan jam) - very sweet without being saccharine and the bread itself is also really good. Also recommend the char siu sandwich. The bread is really good and soft and the pork was fantastic.

My friend and I were craving savory food, so we ordered the breakfast sandwich and egg pocket. I also got a black sesame horchata out of curiosity and my love of anything black sesame. Overall, this cute place is definitely worth checking out and splurging on at least once.The breakfast sandwich was warm and toasted to perfection. The red pepper spread was too spicy for me (I\'m not a fan of spicy food), but my friend loved it. It\'s like a gourmet twist to a breakfast classic, a bit expensive though for the size (like $8).I was a little skeptical at first of the egg pocket being cold (I\'m not a fan of cold asparagus or cold bread) but the biting into the freshness of the bread combined with the creamy egg salad made me forget all of my initial doubts. I inhaled that delicious egg pocket.The black sesame horchata was the most delicious (then again, it\'s literally a hybrid of two of my favorite flavors, horchata and black sesame so I\'m biased). I\'m so glad that I wasn\'t ""cheated"" as usual and the tall glass had the perfect amount of ice in it rather than way too much. It was creamy, sweet but not too sweet, and tasted like rice-y black sesame. I was okay with not being able to taste the cinnamon, since I\'m pretty sure it would clash with the sesame.If I come back to treat myself one day, I will definitely try their famous pandan toast and yummy-looking cake.', 'Kaya toast - 5/5Cappuccino - 4/5Anko sticky bun -4.5/5Not ube tart - 3.5/5Service - 4/5', 'Perfect.Everything we ate was tasty and the service/vibe was warm and non-pretentious. It is still possible to have a nice bakery with a cool vibe without tipping into that uncomfortable gentrification vibe that some newer places have. Felt like a neighborhood spot and folks of all ages were there (family friendly). Great light and decor too! We had a sampling of things for two hungry gals: breakfast sandwich, kaya toast, almond cookies, not-Ube toast and a ham&cheese bread topped with cheese.Everything was delicious! Even the coffee was exceptional! Love the nod to Filipino flavors as well.

And I consider myself an expert given that I grew up in Singapore and most of my mornings started with Kaya toast. It would've been $1 instead of $6 in Singapore, but I'll take what I can get.I liked the char siu sandwich, but it was sooooo overpriced at $16, even for SF standards. I don't know if they bake their own bread for the sandwich- it tasted like any regular white bread from the grocery store. Not sure what warrants that high of a price tag. The brown butter mochi was quite good, but the anko sticky bun was a letdown. I love red bean and the moment I saw it I knew I had to have it. But the bun was very dry, and I wish it had a bit more red bean. Given how many SF bakeries make absolutely perfect sticky buns, I can't give them a pass for this. I should've ordered the not ube tart instead. The space is quaint but there's very limited seating. I did feel bad for occupying a table for 3+ hours but my friend and I had a lot to chat about. And the tables are close together so I'm pretty sure the woman next to us got the full scoop of every dating horror story we've experienced in the bay lol.Hopefully they'll read feedback on yelp and make improvements so I can bump them to 5 stars.""]","['5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '3.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '4.5 star rating']"

Was on the search for a place that had Oatly oat milk (most places have run out and are unable to restock due to a shortage). FARLEY'S STILL HAD OATLY!!I got an iced latte with oat milk and WOW. That's some good espresso. The latte tasted bold yet super smooth!! Not bitter at all!! The drink was less than $6, which is kinda rare for an oat milk latte!! Around $5 is still a lot for coffee, but it's kinda actually not terrible based off of prices in the area. The barista I ordered from was super friendly!!There's an outdoor parklet area that's wonderful for people watching. There's also a huge magazine corner inside with a Bottom line: Amaaazing latte!!

But better than what you'll find at a lot of places in the area"", ""Dropped by on a Monday morning while waiting for a table at Plow. I was about to get my usual (a cappuccino) when I saw that they had a Golden Milk Tumeric Latte! I got excited and ordered it with oat milk - Oatly is the best!

Cafe St. Jorge,"[""One of my favorite spots in the city! A very cute Portuguese style cafe with good coffee and even better food. My favorite things to get are the breakfast board, banana bread, the chia bowl, and my guilty pleasure - a mimosa! The breakfast board comes on a chopping board with a few slices of ham, a warmed baguette, softened butter, and Portuguese cheese (I don't know my cheeses, but I'd say it tastes like a creamier Parmesan). For $7 it's quite filling, though the only downside is you have the slice the baguette yourself, which is a real arm workout since we were only provided with a butter knife. The banana bread warmed up is amazing, especially with the warmed butter it comes with. They're also quite generous with the mimosa, filled to the brim for $7! Check this place out if you're looking for a chill cafe in the Mission. It's a good place to spend a few hours studying at as well since there are outlets on both sides of the wall! No laptops until 2PM on the outlet tables on weekends though!"", ""I have a Sunday ritual of visiting a different coffee shop every weekend and enjoying an Americano and a good lunch. I thought I should start leaving reviews on these based on three criteria (5 being the best): Food, ambiance, and extras. You're probably wondering why I'm not grading on coffee? Well because I'm not an expert, but what I do know about is the above topics. Food: 5They have a tasty variety of options that range from small bites like a toast or for larger appetites they have sandwiches and salads. I had the avocado toast which was good, fresh, and I liked the chili oil that was drizzled on top too. I had been here once before, and I'm pretty sure I got a salad and was happy with that also.Ambiance: 4This cafe was so cute and bright. Plenty of seating and plugs along the walls. There wasn't anything super special about it, but I was comfortable, and the natural light is critical. They did have a little bit of a fly issue... but they flew pretty high that they weren't a real bother. Staff was friendly didn't go much out of their way, but helpful when asked. Extras: 3They had reliable free wifi, which is a must and they had a table or two outside in case of a beautiful day. Other than that, there wasn't much more to tout about."", ""My rating is for the Latte only. \xa0Have not tried anything else yet.I usually buy coffee at Pete's or Starbucks but I was in the area and my friend offered me a Latte. \xa0 I was looking forward to it because the Cafe has good ratings. \xa0 Unfortunately the Latte did not live up to my expectations .My friend got a coffee and food item and was happy with their purchase so I guess it's just hit or.miss.Back to Pete's for me"", ""Their vegan apple muffin is great.

We've had it with the gluten-free sourdough as well, and it's a little smaller but yummy! -- Orange Blossom Waffle // A vegan waffle with real maple syrup, we usually add the fruit for $3 and it's totally worth it (check out the photo). It's a beautiful presentation and nice amount of fruit that really bump it up to an actual breakfast. We've also tried a few of the vegan pastries, like the Nutella muffin and coffee cakes, all of which have been very tasty. Looking forward to trying their chia pudding and other offerings soon.

She was very gracious and met up with me when I needed to work and she found a place with vegan options that was laptop friendly. She actually did a very good job reviewing this place for the both of us, so I\'ll keep the rest short.Yes, they don\'t offer vegan matcha lattes, they should consider adding these to their menu since match is exploding in popularity these days. Moreover, while they offered a number of vegan baked goods, I found them to be average.I\'d work from this cafe again if I\'m in the area, but I wouldn\'t go out of my way to do so since they only offer tea and no tea lattes.', 'I recently traveled to Portugal for a few weeks and was blown away by the delicious food.

The café is so cute! It definitely had a European feel. And the breakfast was amazing! Of course the egg tarts were not as good as the one directly from Portugal, but they were one of the best ones I have had here in the US. This is a secret gem!', ""This cafe is wonderful! Love the ambiance and the food is excellent. When I went I arrived just as some strawberry muffins were coming out of the oven so I bought one. I am very happy I did. It was probably the best muffin I've ever had! And it was vegan!! If you have been there and haven't tried the muffins then go back and try them!!

Overall I really enjoy Cafe St. Jorge because; everything I've tried has been tasty and isn't super heavy, it can get crowded but there isn't usually a wait, and the unique Portuguese spin on many of the dishes. My favorites include:- Chia bowl w/homemade granola: light, sweet, tasty.- Orange blossom waffle w/fruits: visually pretty and yummy- The goose is loose: sweet and savory, a little heavier, good for lunch and you can get it with a side salad- Baked egg breakfast slider: savory and a little sweet, small portion"", ""One of my favorite cafés in the City.

This place is located in Bernal Heights and street parking is free on Sundays, but you will likely still have to park a couple blocks away and walk. They don't have matcha lattes here if that is your drink and while they serve Stumptown Coffee, my mocha turned out so bad it was practically undrinkable. While they had clearly marked vegan options on their menu, most of them where on the sweeter side and I prefer savory vegan breakfast a lot more. For food my friend ordered a vegan blueberry muffin and I ordered avocado toast and vegan banana bread (which they ran out of and I switched to chai coffee cake). My avocado toast was good, but nothing I would go out of my way to seek out again and the coffee cake was just okay too. Really if the coffee sucks, it's pretty much impossible for me to give higher than a 3 star review.

Crown & Crumpet Tea Stop Cafe,"[""I have such lovely memories of coming here on Valentine's Day in 2016 with one of my best girlfriends. Granted I have not been back to visit since, as I moved to Los Angeles later that year, but I remember we had the best time. Our server was a jolly woman who was nothing short of perfect and offered us glasses of champagne while we admired the variety of teas and treats on the menu. I would have never thought that a tea room in such a modern building would be enjoyable, as I have always experienced high tea in cozy, quaint shops, but we had an excellent couple hours, enjoying all of the positive, happy vibes bouncing off the walls. Also, the parking garage across the street was great and made it possible for us to fully appreciate our experience, as there is nothing more aggravating than having to drive around for ages trying to find a spot.I would definitely stop by Crown & Crumpet again, the next time I'm in the area!"", ""Cute little afternoon tea place in Japan Town.Cute teas, cute cups and saucers, cute decor.I've passed this place by quite a bit but this was the first time I tried it and we had a nice time!My favorite part were the scones with jam and clotted cream. \xa0The scones were dense and buttery while the jam was very strawberry-t and the cream a perfect complement. \xa0Today's option was blueberry, but it looks like they have other scones at different times.The sandwiches were fine (I like the mini sausage roll, but puff pastry+Vienna sausage will get me every time) and the other desserts were fine too. \xa0Nothing to write home about.But I'd come back for the scones!"", ""I really enjoyed Crown and Crumpet! A friend and I visited this tea stop cafe on a Wednesday early afternoon and there were only a few people there. The LivingSocial deal was great. It was $48 for 'Afternoon Tea' for two people (on a weekday) which is a good deal because regular price is $34 a person. I didn't realize it's just inside of the New People building. The ambience was kind of awkward just because it's out in the open and anyone walking by can look at you. \xa0Minus one star for the environment.I loved the 3 tiered stand with all the goodies. Bottom tier had a variety of tea sandwiches and salad, middle tier was warm biscuits with 3 different spreads, top tier was chocolate covered strawberries, brownies, and other little dessert treats. Everything was delicious! I thought I might be hungry afterwards, but there was so much food included in the package that we even brought some of the desserts home.I tried the Paris tea which was delicious! Perfect balance of vanilla and caramel and... tea! Added a little milk and sugar to top it off. My friend had the lychee tea. It was a bit too strong of Lychee flavor for my taste, though.Customer service was great! Our server topped off our tea after a while to make sure it was nice and hot. He periodically checked on us to ensure we were enjoying ourselves. Since the location is in Japantown, it was a bit difficult to find parking. There are meters close by and also hour-limit parking around too.I will definitely come back and bring other people to this spot.

Not only do they accommodate gluten free customers with superb quality goodies, but they were even able to accommodate my keto diet!

Bit once we got settled in it was simply perfect. The decor, the service and the food were all impressive."", ""I have been here before with my boyfriend on a date nearly 3 years ago. It's a very tiny space located in the lobby of the New People building of Japantown. The decor is very girly and cute, reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland. The food doesn't really stand out here. It's nice, but not stellar, and not worth near $40 in value. I was also disappointed that they had no petit fours, which is my favorite dessert to have with high tea.I only chose this place to come for my most recent high tea experience because my friend had never been here before. We both enjoy high tea, so this was a place for her to at least try.Despite being 15 minutes late to our reservation, I appreciated that the waitstaff was still so accommodating. My friend ended up being half an hour late, and while waiting for her, our waiter was so nice and patient to explain the different teas to us. I was intrigued by the Alice Drink Me Tea, which is a super floral black tea. I found the scent to be very fragrant and lovely. The waiter warned it could be in your face, but I appreciated the strong aroma.While the waitstaff was nice, they have to kick you out since they need to adhere to time limits for everyone. My friend was appalled they would do that. While I can understand that, it does suck to have to take my leftovers to go."", ""Had a lovely lunch with my granddaughter (our second visit). Service, ambiance and food were all excellent.

They make the space work and keep it cute! Service here is always 200% amazing, and the food is always good. They take reservations through Yelp which saves so much time because they are usually busy. I usually order the Afternoon Tea for One and special request for vegetarian and fruit free (stupid raw fruit allergy), and they always make it work. Thank you for that because I know it is inconvenient for the kitchen. My only complaint are the desserts they pick for the Afternoon Tea sets are too sweet and don\'t fit with the high tea vibe.

If you have a group of friends, you can enjoy different types of tea. \xa0We tried the Lychee Black Tea, Chai tea, their premium black tea (my favorite), and a green tea (that I don\'t remember the name). \xa0So put on your pretty dress and make a reservation via Yelp and enjoy some tea!', ""Not the audience for this kind of places but it was a good experience for the girls. Service, food and tea were great. Giving it 4 stars since being an entry to a shopping center doesn't help with the atmosphere and the price was a bit high."", ""My daughter and I went to Crown & Crumpet this morning for her friend's birthday tea party. It's located right in the middle of Japan town (so you can do your shopping at the Asian supermarkets or Daiso before or after tea)! So the tea shop is located on the ground floor with cute little tables and lovely decor. They have a party room upstairs and this is where we were seated. The decor is wonderful! They have a wall of china plates which they call The Great Wall of China (get it?)!!!! There is a large cardboard cut out of Queen Elizabeth so you are at tea with the queen! They had the table set up with crafts for the girls on one end and a few seats for adults on the other end. Our hits very graciously ordered high tea for parents as well! The hostess for the tea party takes care of everything...so parents can sit back and enjoy their tea as well. The girls made little craft bags and they were given an option of swamp tea (a tropical punch) or blue eyes (which was a pink punch of some sort).Their menu is quite extensive and they have a range of teas to choose from. The food trays arrived and we had an assortment of sandwiches, scones and sweet treats! It was thoroughly enjoyed by all!After we were done eating, sone games were played: \xa0tea bingo and pass the parcel. After this, birthday cupcakes! All in all the girls were entertained for a solid two hours. This is a great place to take your friends for tea, have a birthday party or a baby/bridal shower. We will definitely be back!"", ""Super random location, but affordable and great service. \xa0Crown & Crumpet occupies this random front entrance to the mall, by the New People door sign. \xa0Even as you sit there, it feels odd, random, and out of place- but it's kind of this awkward quirkiness which makes me like it. It definitely feels very Japan. They have a photo booth and photo booth wall with cutesy little chairs and table covers. \xa0They have a wide tea selection- our whole group got the nursery tea (the one for children, heh) because we wanted a wide sample of food. Our server was super friendly about it and we were super happy with the selection."", ""I love Crown and Crumpet so much! It's a perfect place for a birthday party (for any age) or a date, and sits in the heart of Japantown, right across from Benihana and the Kabuki theatre. Inside the building are Japanese shops to explore. As for tea, they have Afternoon tea which is the classic high tea option, which is cheaper for children! They also offer lunches and cheaper tea options if you don't want to go full high tea. They serve sandwiches of the day but always have vegetarian options prepared, you just need to ask!Don't forget to tell them if it's your birthday ;)"", ""Heather L. and I decided to splurge on an afternoon tea date. Customer service here was excellent. I asked for iced tea and they were able to accommodate my request without hesitation. Our waitress was also attentive to us and our needs/questions. A++++ My favorites from the afternoon tea spread were: all the sandwiches, blueberry and oat pastry, salted caramel brownie, scone, and crumpet. I was excited to see crumpets because I've never had one before. The texture was soft and fluffy! Yes, please. We were pretty full before we even got to the pastries! We ended up taking all of the pastries to go. Also, be sure to ask for refills of your tea. It's included! It's pretty pricey, but the overall experience was nice. I love having afternoon tea with the girls, so I personally think it's worth the price tag."", ""If you are in the market for an afternoon tea dearie, you'll likely find Crown and Crumpet an adorable and cheeky option in the city.Its located across the street from Japantown's Kintestsu Mall (the Japantown Peace Plaza) in the lobby of the modern, glass fronted New People Building. Despite their lobby set up, they have managed to make the space here feel cozy and as charming as is possible to given space constraints. \xa0We had the afternoon tea for $32, which is near impossible to find anywhere around town elsewhere on a Monday. \xa0(Many places in the city offer high tea on weekends only, or W-Sunday.)Our tea server was friendly and knowledgable, and was being served up with a British accent by owner Christopher Dean. \xa0Our tea included chopped egg & turkey, smoked salmon and pesto tea sandwiches, \xa0a petite cheese scone, the never eaten salad. \xa0On the middle tier, we were served crumpets and scones with clotted cream, jam and lemon curd. \xa0On the top layer, desserts, including matcha cake with strawberry frosting, caramel chocolate brownies, rose infused shortbread, and a chocolate covered strawberry. They have a fairly concise tea selection here, but the list included many herbal and black tea options. \xa0Charming spot, full of groups of ladies in summer dresses having tea!"", ""In the past I have hated on crown and crumpets but I recently went again and I actually quite enjoyed myself. It is still definitely one of the more expensive high tea places and doesn't give that much food, however the food I had was really really tasty. Specifically, I LOVED the scone and crumpet. The scone did still have that dryer texture but it tasted really good. Plus I love that they give you a crumpet because that is more unique. The crumpet was perfect. The cucumber mint sandwich was very tasty as was the turkey blt. The sausage rolls smelled really good but were meh (we didn't need to get a separate order of sausage rolls.) The desserts were good as well. I had a great time chatting with my friend and sipping tea. Oh! I got the Marie Antoinette tea and that was really super tasty. I would come back again!"", 'I think this place is over-rated. The establishment is really small and located in the lobby of a hotel. It was very hard to find and they do not answer their phone when I tried to call them when I was lost. I called three times and no answer. I asked them why they did not answer and they said they were busy and rarely answer during peak times. The assortment of teas was alright but the tea came out lukewarm\u200b.

The Philz HQ!!It's tucked away in a kinda quiet industrial neighborhood, so you won't get any of the usual crazy hustle and bustle of SF. There's some outdoor seating, as well as tons of space inside!! The inside is SUPER HIP!! So nicely decorated, and it has a nice modern vibe!!My go-to drink orders:- 1/2 yerba mate, 1/2 chamomile, iced, medium creamy with almond milk and light sweet with honey- Iced Philtered Soul, straight upIt is the headquarters, so they test out new food items here. They had the ricotta & pistachio toast, which isn't something you can find at all the locations that serve food (not all locations have toast/food selections other than what you see in the bakery display case)!! The ricotta & pistachio toast was kinda missing something?? It was served on Starter Bakery bread and came with honey and sea salt, but it kinda lacked the flavor I was expecting?? It was tasty with a hint of sweet and salty that complemented each other nicely, but I think I'm going to stick to my usual: avocado toast with no eggThey had a creamy hazelnut toast on the menu, but I didn't see it in the display case, so I asked if they were still serving it, and the worker said they ran out of hazelnuts and that they stopped because it wasn't super popular :( I also saw a few energy bowl options!! Hella rad!!Bottom line: Love this location!! The workers are super friendly, and there's tons of space if you're looking for a place to work.

In addition to the wonderful workspace, wifi and kind staff members, the coffee is INCREDIBLE!!!!For the coffee snob that is into PURE black coffee, Philz will not disappoint the highly developed palate of yours. My go-to is Aromatic Arabic. A darker blend with tones of walnut and a smokiness to it. No cream, no sugar needed. Just a good cup of coffee to get the caffeine surge you need for work, and wonderful taste to keep your soul happy. In addition, the breakfast burritos, banana nut bread and complementary cucumber water are frosting on the wonderful (coffee) cake that is Philz.

I have travelled extensively both domestically and internationally, and I can confidently endorse Philz as one of the best coffees I have had . . . ever.

And with each cup individually ground and brewed when you order you always know you're getting a fresh cup. Staff are friendly, and I loved that they're not a bunch of coffee snobs.

Since we were looking for a place to sit down and drink some coffee, we decided to try here. I was first surprised and confused at the four different coffee dispensers at the area, where there are sugar and creams, and I later realized why. I ordered the cafe au lait and when the received my order, it was a cup filled with foamy milk. I probably looked dumbfounded because the cashier gestured and told me to pour coffee from the coffee dispensers. There were four different types (one being decaf), and I selected the darkest roast. The coffee was SO GOOD! My favorite type of coffee is the taste where it has no sour and bitter notes. The french roast didn't include any of these, and after I took a sip, it left a lingering toasty aftertaste. Even my relative, who can't drink coffee because they don't like the bitter taste, was able to drink a share. I was even tempted to purchase a bag of coffee beans, but that will be for the next visit."", ""Great coffee and amazing service!

My friend and I stopped here for tea before exploring the area. We ordered at the register and picked up our drinks on the left hand side. I noticed they had lot of staff working at once but it's because they offer so many things on the menu. The girl that was working at the register was so nice! She greeted us the minute we came in and also made recommendations. She was also very polite. This is the type of customer service every restaurant needs to have.It only took us about 10 minutes to get our teas. We sat down at a table facing the street. I liked that this restaurant had an open layout with so much space. There were tables distributed across the restaurant and I loved that they weren't so close together. The restaurant was very clean and pretty much everything you'd want from a coffee shop. Additionally, I noticed that you could also buy some blue bottle branded goodies here such as cloth handbags and cups. Overall, my experience here was great.

I'm beyond pleased that a location has opened up on Fillmore! The pour over coffee is excellent. The baristas lost a star because during a visit they forgot to start my poor over order and it ended up taking 20 minutes for my coffee. (A smoother, systematic, operation process could help reduce the chance of this failure mode) Anyway, I'm also a fan of their cappuccinos, which, by the way, arrive looking like a work of art! They are almost too pretty to drink.The avocado toast is my special splurge treat. It's thick, avocado-y, and the sprinkling of magic spice salt tops it off in a divine way. Check out the cool gift sets available for purchase!"", ""I always enjoy my experience at Blue Bottle Coffee. They are everything to love when I seek coffee crafted with care, made with love and artistically finished. I go for my usual snickerdoodle and a latte when I go to a Blue Bottle Café. Although there are times when I do opt in for the Belgian wafel for the locations with this item in their pastry selection.I highly praise the staff for being friendly, delivering prompt and courteous service. The facility is always clean which provides a warm welcome to customers. Each location and every visit always finishes with a positive experience. I started going to Blue Bottle Coffee in 2012, first two visits were coffee beans purchase. First visit was in Hayes Valley, then the next two visits were at the Mint Plaza location. Upon the third visit, I dig into getting something to drink. I have been patronizing Blue Bottle Coffee ever since. Blue Bottle Coffee happens to be one of the coffee shops on the top of my go to list. The latte art I see is culinary creativity. Therefore, this is truly coffee that is really worth enjoying.One thing I always notice is the staff team's friendliness. They are polite and friendly, this comes with the warm greeting.Reasons for rating:- friendly staff- excellent service- clean, spacious facilityLooking to get a cup of coffee that is carefully crafted, made with love and artistically finished? Blue Bottle Coffee is your answer.I don't recall experiencing a super long wait. Sometimes there may be a line, but they do make it move fast. The work always get done fast and right. It is obviously notable that customer service at Blue Bottle Coffee is always on the mark for excellency. This is truly something that motivates me to patronize Blue Bottle Cafes. Props to dedication and excellent work."", 'My family and I ended up coming here after a terrible experience trying to find the Mint St. location in San Francisco. Let\'s just say that we gave up after getting a ticket for accidentally driving in the bus/taxi lane.Man, there are too many signs in SF streets that you got to be on high alert if you want to even turn the corner.Anywho, after NOT even getting to step into a Blue Bottle AND getting a stupid ticket...we decided that either we would put off Blue Bottle for the rest of the day OR for another week...maybe even a month. BUMMER.As the day progressed and we celebrated our grandma\'s birthday, which was what we initially came to SF for that day, we discovered that there was another SF location that might be more convenient...Fillmore!The parking game, though still not the best, was much better near the Fillmore location (I don\'t want to emphasize the ""much better"" cause how much better can parking in SF get?).First off, the streets weren\'t as confusing as Mint St. Secondly, the walk down Fillmore St is a must for those visiting SF. There are so many little stores and eateries along the way. Note: The walk contains quite a few slopes, so I would advise those who might have difficulty with such walks to just drive.Back to Blue Bottle: The Blue Bottle on Fillmore is located on a street corner (it\'s quite visible). It\'s super clean and simple inside. There is absolutely no clutter, and there are light-colored wooden tables spread out in the vicinity. It\'s pretty bright inside both from the natural light coming through the windows as well as the artificial lights inside. Plus, they have a great selection of music (ahem...Lauryn Hill...Yuna...I repeat...GREAT).The menu, much like the place, is simple. There are a few varieties of drip coffees but everything else only has one option (e.g, there is just one ""caffe Latte"" or one ""caffe mocha""). We were discussing this, but it\'s interesting and great that although the quality of Blue Bottle Coffee is known for being excellent, the price for a cup of coffee doesn\'t differ much from that of chains like Starbucks or Peet\'s (except for the Affogato-ice cream in coffee...oh my gosh, I need to get this next time, but it\'s like 600 calories, and it is close to $6).I ordered the Caffe Latte (which came with a pretty design), and the best way I would describe it is that it is ""whole."" There was a deep taste (richness) without being overwhelming (thanks to both the froth and the quality of the Latte itself). I do think it had too much foam/creaminess on top-it took a little while to get to the liquid).I also got to try my sister\'s Cascara Fizz (a lemony-sweet soda). Wow, I really enjoyed it. It had just the right amount of sweetness and tartness. Even the sparkling water they used was not harsh on the throat (a more diluted version)? It was a bit pricy for the $4ish we paid though. Without the ice cubes, the drink probably amounted to less than 8 oz.The customer service was okay. The guys were professional in that they answered our questions and got our drinks right, but it was decent-no complaints. They did their job without any frills. Anyways, my experience at Blue Bottle (and the adventure getting there) was a memorable one. So here\'s four stars!', 'Waffles and soy cappuccino are to die for. Unfortunately, the soy part got discontinued, and oatmeal milk is not my favorite.', ""*8/6 Update*: Added a star because of a kind note from the manager regarding my experience.A respectable coffee shop at the corner of Fillmore and Jackson. The interior decor was contemporary and felt comfortable. The New Orleans iced coffee was quite good. 3-stars are for the amenities and atmosphere inside. Ever since Blue Bottle Coffee was acquired by Nestle for $700M, I've wanted to swing by to see what this new concept was about. This was my first Blue Bottle experience because I happened to be in the neighborhood. I did not come with high expectations. My thinking was that unless you're a coffee connoisseur, you would likely miss the hype train that everyone else had been on. I was gladly proven wrong regarding this point. The iced-coffee here was noticeably better than any other iced I've had in a while. The perfect amount of sweetness with a smooth finish. I was very happy with this order. The location itself leaves a bit to be wanting. There was no WiFi (!) in the shop. I understand faster table turnover is an important business metric, but this may be trying a little too hard. The baristas sometimes don't seem to have that much attention to detail either. I was sitting next to a table of empty mugs with some liquid spilled on it. The barista came over, took away the mugs, and didn't look back at wiping the stain. 3/5."", 'Disclaimer: non-coffee drinker here.But when I first noticed that blue bottle was opening in the neighborhood, all I could think of was ""open, open, open!""Sure, call me a groupie, but I can\'t resist jumping on the third wave coffee bandwagon. Granted, the cheapest cup of Joe is $3.75 (Single origin, made one cup at a time, yadda, yadda) and their TCHO laced mocha drink clocks in at $4.75, BB is pricey. And of course, when the barista smiles at you, that\'s an least an extra $1! I usually get a decaf Americano or decaf iced latte (decaf -- A waste of time AND money! don\'t do it!) i try it first without putting all that garbage (sugar and milk) and declare it delicious. But then, I can\'t handle the bitter taste so I augment my coffee to the point that my $3.75 cup tastes like a sugary mess. AAAHHHH. Like I said, non-coffee drinker here. I should just stick to their iced cascara fizz next time.', ""Doesn't live up to the hype. \xa0Cappuccino was small and expensive and just tasted okay. \xa0Too many great places for coffee in the City to settle for okay."", '1 person in front of me in line, I then ordered 3 drinks. 20 mins still waiting.

I had a caffe mocha, it tasted great and really smooth.', ""Cashier who took order was not friendly. Cappuccino is served in a small cup. Way too much milk for a cap. With the amount of milk they included, coffee was too milky and tasted more like a latte. Place was noisy and didn't feel like a place that I wanted to stay in. Quickly sat up and left to get some peace. Their music was also way too loud for 730am on Saturday. It's over priced but taste of coffee was good simply too much milk for a cap. Might go back to try a dry cap but for an everyday spot. I don't mind paying a high price but would expect a delicious true cap not a mini petite latte."", 'I\'ve never had a bad experience at a Blue bottle before until now :/ I wasn\'t too impressed with their service today. I ordered a NOLA and an iced latte and they messed up my order. They ""accidentally"" forgot my order after I patiently waited for 10 minutes and then they rushed to make my coffee and the NOLA taste was off. It didn\'t taste the same and the chicory was overpowering. Not the best blue bottle cafe and they need to work out the kinks in their communication.', ""REVIEWER # 12I've experienced the Blue Bottle Coffee near Market and near the Twitter Building; for the most part, I enjoy it and love that the space is always kept clean. Customer service is always flawless, and everyone is very accommodating. \xa0I was happy to see that another Blue Bottle Coffee opened right in the Fillmore area, trust me-it is needed. I'm sure many people get tired of seeing the same ol' Pete's Coffee and Starbucks. Blue Bottle Coffee makes drinking coffee more exciting. This new location recently opened in June 2017 and has everyone excited over the grand opening. As from what I notice, there are no discounts or specials happening. The location is very spacious and as of now, there is no signage located outside indicating the name of the business or announcing the grand opening. I literally only found out because I walked pasted it during the Fillmore Festival. The interior of this location is different from other locations. There is natural light that comes through the windows, but it reminds me of a retail store. It's not as welcoming as I would expect. I love that this location serves the Waffle and Avocado Toast! OMG, you must try one if you are here! Overall, a great place to stop for the coffee feens. It's much tastier then the normal Starbucks and Peet's Coffee."", 'So excited about having a Blue Bottle in the neighborhood. So excited in fact that I went there twice in one day. There\'s a saying in German that literally translates to ""it\'s hard to stand on one only leg"" and figuratively serves as the justification for the second beer/wine/jello shot. I believe this also very true for coffee in general and the Blue Bottle New Orleans in particular. I\'ve been raving about this one on several other occasions/locations throughout the city, and the lovestory continues in the Pac Heights location. Creamy, icy, lightly sweet deliciousness in a glass! More to love about this location: spacious interior, pretty minimalistic, but not too cool. Waffles and Avocado toast on the menu. Lots of coffee gear to check out and wonder about how great they would look in your own kitchen. And of course all the different grinds and blends for your own coffee maker of choice. I like the little packages that serve 1, great to try different blends without committing to a whole bag. Chances are high that you\'ll find me here more often than my wallet allows.', 'I am definitely missing something here. I stopped in with a group while in town on business.

The pastries are from Craftsman and Wolves and perfectly pair with the caffeinated beverage of your choice. My fav so far? The apple cider cake donut.

Back then, pat milk was just starting to hype up, and I saw they had oat milk on their choices of milk. Me getting too excited, I told the lady I wanted a mocha shake with Oat Milk. She looked at me kinda funny and started to explain that their shakes are made with ice cream that contains dairy....I thought for a second, and said, what the heck! Let's make it anyway!

Can not taste much squash flavorShared cheese: I think this combination is really good for a group start. Love the honey comb', ""I've been here a few times, and don't think its worth it. The tea is good, but if you're Asian, you know how to make better tea at home.The food is solid, but not something I'd go out of my way for.That leaves the experience... the decor and ambience both indoors and outdoors is hard to beat, but I've been here twice for lunch on a weekday almost 12 months apart and both times I sat for over 60 minutes before my food came out. The first time, I had to get a few items boxed and left early, and yesterday, my group was about 5 minutes away from it.I understand long waits for full service complicated food, but the sandwiches and bowls on the menu hardly warrant it.I'd really suggest to management that they find some sort of appetizers that they can make in less than 30 minutes, \xa0and consider serving them in larger quantities, \xa0or put out complementary table crackers. \xa0Waits are fine, but not if you sit for 30 minutes before even appetizers and tea even come out (literally we sat there for 30+ minutes... )"", 'I love the location of Samovar and the food and drinks are pretty good, but I\'m growing frustrated by the deceptive pricing and hidden fees.First, I have found on three different occasions that the price on my receipt was higher than the price on the menu. \xa0For instance, the Cold Brew Matcha is $7 on the menu, but is $8 on the bill. \xa0They are always shocked when I highlight these discrepancies and only fix it with a one-time discount on the bill - they don\'t seem to fix the POS.Second, they charge an ""SF Employer Mandate,"" as so many restaurants do. \xa0As you hopefully know now, this is not a real tax and restaurants charge an arbitrary amount to cover costs to comply with the new law requiring businesses with over 20 employees to provide healthcare for employees. Samovar charges 5% of the bill, which is far more than would be required to comply with the $1.89 per employee hour for healthcare.Third, they now also charge an additional mysterious ""Back of House Service Fee"" which is 4% of the total bill. It\'s unclear what this money goes towards, but presumably compensation for the cooks and cleaning staff. \xa0But shouldn\'t that come out of the revenues? Or the tip?Don\'t get me wrong - I\'m strongly supportive of increasing the wages for restaurant workers.

Sabrina was very nice, and said it was what she was trained to do. I was quite bothered but take her at her word that Jesse (the owner though she didn't mention his name) must have wanted that. Some of the tea is still very good like the blood orange puer and \xa0the incomparable green ecstasy (sencha snd matcha). But even that has gone downhill from the original preparation and now quite bitter. If you buy the tea leaves, the instructions are often way wrong - like the green ecstasy should be cold brewed then ten seconds in 185 water - not two minutes boiling! The tempeh is great fir vegetarian but sickly sweet. Other nice dishes are the Japanese tea service. Once the tech bubble bursts, I imagine the shop will regroup and go back to its previous quality. In the meantime, buy Japanese tea as asakichi in Japan town. The matcha is much cheaper and much better. I buy the very best orange dot but it's the priciest.

Perfect for a not-so-heavy brunch on a nice day.I came here on Sunday at noon and there weren't that many people there so we got seated right away. The restaurant has massive windows with a lot of sunlight and super nicely decorated. The staff were all really nice and attentive. We got the duck & egg jook, the smoked duck hash, the chia seed pudding, and the chai. The smoked duck they use in the jook and hash is so good, and I'm not even a fan of duck, but it was like bacon but better and not oily. I might try something else when I go next time though, because I wasn't like coo coo for coco puffs for the jook or hash.

I got the earl grey tea smoked chicken sandwich and I couldn\'t taste the earl grey tea at all. The the chicken salad was very salty and there was nothing too special about it. I wouldn\'t recommend this sandwich. I also got the vintage 2009 tea which was $15. The description of the tea was ""dark chocolate, caramel, pecan pie"" so I thought the tea would be sweet. It is definitely not a sweet tea. It tasted more like an herbal tea if anything. So if you want a sweet tea, I suggest trying something else!

First, when I asked what was vegan on the menu. The waitress just mentioned the sandwich and nothing else, which didn't give me many options. Then after ordering, I was served a cold tea when I asked for it hot, and the waitress snapped at me when I asked about getting the hot version, saying that was why she asked me if I wanted iced or hot. I'm 100% sure I said hot when she asked for clarification and my friends agree. When my friends asked for more butter for their toast, it took quite a while before it came.The whole time I felt very unwelcome dining here, which is very unfortunate since we were looking forward to the event. I had heard that the place is pretty vegan friendly but I'd say the options are pretty minimal. None of the brunch menu was vegan I think. Some vegan options were labeled as vegetarian (I had to ask for clarification), which was pretty confusing. I appreciate that the menu has pretty healthy options with simple ingredients and that there are many tea options for tea-lovers.

Definitely a solid spot in my book and I'm really excited to have an excuse to come back."", ""Absolutely amazing. Came into the city to do some shopping but wanted something to eat first. Stumbled upon this place and decided to give it a try. Decor and atmosphere is so cozy and has an amazing view of downtown SF. Started with a chardonnay and Maiden's Ecstasy. Everything we ordered tasted amazing. - Butternut Squash Platter- Grilled Duck Reuben- Salmon Egg Bowl- Chia Pudding - Mochi PlatterDefinitely Recommend and will be back to try the Jook!-B"", ""I had this place on my list of go-to places for awhile but to be completely honest, this was not my best restaurant situation, here is the breakdown:Service (2.5/5): When we were seated it took some time before we actually got any menus - we had to call a waiter over to ask for menus because had waited so long and were quite hungry. Things were also a bit rushed when it came to ordering and paying the bill. We were given the check before I even finished half of my tea and I didn't understand the rush because there was no line and plenty of open tables. So yeah, service wasn't great and our waiter didn't really check up on us. Food (3/5): Presentation-wise, the food looked great. I ordered the Jook with duck and eggs, because I had seen other order it on Yelp and was excited to get some flavorful duck and rice porridge. However, I found the dish to be quite bland. There wasn't much seasoning in the porridge (even with the addition of the sauce on the side) and the duck. My friends got the smoked duck hash and eggs benefits and also said that their food was underseasoned. So overall the food was underwhelming. Drinks (4/5): I got the velvet cacao because the tea I was originally going to get (a blood orange flavored one) was out and the waiter recommended this. It was fine - a bit bitter towards the end if you let the leaves soak too long. It had a nice faint cacao taste but it wasn't anything mind-blowing good. Setting (4/5): The space was nice and well lit. There was plenty of seating with both indoors and out."", ""Ok I love the location of Samovar, the look of Samovar and its setup. I also love the variety of teas that Samovar has and appreciate that they pair the teas with meals. BUT I think the value of the food is not worth the price at all. My SO and I ordered the California rose and Japanese sencha teas and enjoyed the teas very much. However, the potstickers, vegan roll and sandwich were underwhelming in both flavor and capacity. Of course, the lightness of the food goes well with tea-- you want smaller foods to truly appreciate the taste and texture of the tea. But I just don't get the pricing or the value of it. I'd come back for the tea for sure, but probably eat elsewhere."", 'A good place to go for tea service with the big floor to ceiling window panes. (Plus they allow reservations for tea time which is a bonus).A lot of natural lighting for good photos!Food itself was pretty decent and tea was good too.I had the squash dumplings with veggie/duck stir fry and blood orange puer tea. Service was also good.', ""Catching up with friends is always better with a yummy brunch! So glad they had vegan options! I had a veggie sandwich and indulged in some yummy treats to share! The tea selection was honestly overwhelming but the staff seemed very knowledgeable when we asked about the different teas! The atmosphere was absolutely gorgeous!!

All in all, I would definitely get brunch here again and can't wait to try the different teas off the menu!"", ""Arrived with a friend around lunch time on a Saturday during President's Day weekend. Surprisingly there was no wait! | v i b e |Located in the BEAUTIFUL Yerba Buena Gardens. I love the big windows because it allows so much natural light into the restaurant. The restaurant was smaller than I expected, but there is a lot of seating both inside and outside. The decor is minimalistic and clean, and even though it looks super fancy, the vibe is actually pretty casual.| m e n u |FYI: Brunch menu is served until 2pm. Here's what we ordered:1. Smoked duck & egg jook ($15): hit the spot because my friend and I wanted something comforting and warm. The porridge is thick, and I enjoyed the toppings it came with. The rice porridge itself is unseasoned; it's served with soy sauce and sriracha. I did sprinkle a little bit of soy sauce in but wouldn't have minded it unseasoned. 2. Salmon + egg bowl ($13): This too was unseasoned and came with soy sauce to add in. We added some avocado too. I recommend drizzling some in to add more flavor to the salmon. Good if you're in the mood for something clean and healthy. Don't know if it was worth the price. 3. Iced matcha latte ($6): Ordered with almond milk. Super refreshing! Comes UNSWEETENED. 4. Tart peach tea ($10): Comes in a lil teapot with a little tea cup. So cute. The tea itself is light with a hint of peach. You can drink it with milk and sugar, but we prefer our teas straight. | t l ; d r |Very cute and aesthetically-pleasing restaurant that serves wide variety of high-quality teas and solid food! Definitely worth a visit, and while you're there, take a stroll through the park as well."", 'Never tasted quiche sooooo delicious \xa0Went back next day for moreWonderful flavors in the chai tea, as well', ""I have had this place on my go to list for a while, and I finally made it here today.

I wasn't too hungry when we got here, so I went for a Cranberry eucalyptus tea pot and we shared a sweets platter. The Sweets platter \xa0included, mochi cakes, chia pudding and dates stuffed with goat cheese with a hint of mint.

The matcha latte is unsweetened, which I liked, but you can add a sweetener of your choice if you prefer a sweeter option.

The cafe is warm on chilly days. They offer water infused with lemon, cucumber, and ginger!I've only had a chai and a pesto panino here.... but both were great and I'm looking forward to exploring more of their menu while I work here. The weekdays are not bad at all, pretty quiet, and there's usually good music and a dog hanging out to perk up your day."", ""ONE OF MY MOST FAVORITE CAFE SO FAR!This is a 2-story local cafe in the corner of the street. When I first walked in I saw the sign 'GOOD VIBE ONLY.' I knew suddenly I was in the right place. On the wall of the first floor, you will see tons of dogs' pictures frame hanging on the wall. These are all the dogs that have visited this cafe. I love everyone who takes dogs seriously lol There are so many food and beverage selections. When I ordered my iced mocha, he asked specifically how I wanted. I love dark mocha and that was just exactly what I needed. IT'S JUST RIGHT. You can enjoy the lively vibe downstairs or walk to the second floor where you will see a huge lovely octopus on the wall. You can peacefully work on your project quietly there.Will definitely come back next time I visit San Fran!!"", ""I don't know what it is, but their bread tastes like soap/cleaner. So far I tried their banana bread and focaccia bread (two weeks apart) and they both had the same soapy/cleaner taste.

All the drinks here are absolutely delicious! A bit on the pricey side ($7.50 for a smoothie...?!) but understandable because of the ingredients used. One of my favorite drinks here is the lavender lemonade. The floral crisp taste is perfect for a nice sunny hot day. It's refreshing and delicious! The mango avocado smoothie is very subtle in flavors but it does make me feel super full after drinking half of this. They had samples of their PB&J and this was amazing. It felt like I was eating a PB&J sandwich without the heavy carbs. Can't wait to try the other items on the menu. Highly recommend for the drinks. And who doesn't love the cute puppy running around. This deserves 5 stars on its own!!"", ""I love it already! Got a little excited and ordered double drinks this morning: the golden gate smoothie and house coffee.

Henry’s House of Coffee,"[""I am a very very picky coffee drinker. I'm a borderline coffee snob. I love Henry's place.The coffee here is always hot and tasty as heck. They roast on site so you know the quality and the freshness is top-notch. I can't say enough about the staff that work here. I am very demanding on service, and the staff here never lets me down. I love that it's locally owned and managed. You owe it to come by and get some brew at this place if you are on the west side."", ""Don't have a whole lot to say, but I enjoyed my coffee.

I got: -Chai latte: While the chai was flavorful, it was too sweet for me - that the first thing I tasted was the cane sugar and then the chai. -Croissant: ehh, very buttery and flakey but didn't really have a body.-Pour over: YES get the pour-over. I hear the Bella is really good and the barista told me that his favorite was the Conquistador. I ended up getting the Thailand which was described as nutty and smooth. For me, it wasn't so nutty, but indeed very smooth with a subtle citrus tone and chocolate finish."", ""Made a stop just to try their coffee and buy some to go while visiting from Los Angeles. I have been fallowing them on IG for a while and made a promise to myself to stop by when in the area. Finally I got to Stop by last weekend right before going to the Golden Gate Park for a walk. I tried the cappuccino and loved it. Delicious coffee and danishes. Everything we got was good and fresh.

I haven't tried the food but it looks very fresh"", ""Henry's is pretty close to where I live and they just recently remodeled their coffee shop. I needed some coffee in the morning and decided to get some Espresso from here. I came on a Wednesday and there were people outside chatting and people inside doing work. The cashiers were friendly and the Espresso was great. For $2.50, it's a steal! The prices here are really reasonable and I was in and out in like a minute. They do accept Apple Pay here which is really convenient for me. I believe they also roast their own coffee on site and you can smell the great coffee aroma once you enter. I like Henry's because street parking is easy to find and I can get a jump on my day pretty fast. But if you want to sit, they also have that option and have pastries and breakfast items for you to enjoy."", ""My favorite coffee that I get delivered to Alaska. Armenian coffee is a must, with that extra fine grind. I also like the Bella coffee, rich and chocolaty dark. I've ordered for Christmas gifts from here, and I received my package 4 days after ordering it. That was fast, so I gave it to them to enjoy early this year! If I make to San Francisco I will definitely stop in.This is my 1000th review, and it's so worth it to spend it on reviewing this place.P.S. I always love the sesame snaps that come in the delivery package. It's a sweet surprise."", ""I came in for the first time on a late Monday afternoon and the shop was pretty empty, though I noticed quite a few people stopped in for togo orders. It's a cute spot and though I didn't test out the wifi, just based on table size and the volume level that day I think it'd be a good place to study or get some work done. I ordered a small mocha (hot) and really enjoyed it! The drink wasn't too bitter nor too sweet - it was honestly just right and definitely one of the better mochas I've had. On top of that, in comparison to other nearby coffee shops, the prices here are a bit lower which is great because coffee spending definitely adds up. Service was also really friendly!"", ""Want to enjoy some coffee and get work done in SF? Henry's House of Coffee has great Wi-Fi, plenty of plugs, and great coffee as well. Can't beat that combo. The place is spacious unlike many other cafes in the SF Bay Area.I'd recommend Henry's."", ""I honestly don't understand how this place gets such great reviews. Just went and had a mediocre cappuccino (at best) and the driest bagel. They have no fresh produce to put on the bagel which is questionable.

Two of my friends recommended Henry's House Coffee and I was very interested to give it a try. I checked their website and ordered half n half Armenian coffee and Dark Armenian coffee. Confessing that Henry's House Coffee is an expensive coffee, $17 for for a pack of coffee, it's kinda pricey; but worth giving it a try! The taste of dark one is pleasurably wonderful. Flavors that I am getting out of Henry's coffee are rich, fragrant, and blissfully smooth; even though it is dark but it's very smooth and no bitter taste (for Armenian coffee drinkers).

Before I get too far into this review I should note, it was not written from the location as they don't offer free wifi. Kinda strange for a coffee shop but, hey maybe they don't want people overstaying their welcome :) Anyway, I ordered a tall cup of joe (drip coffee) and a plain croissant. The coffee was tasty and the croissant was above average, not spectacular. I will say that the other pastries in the case looked delicious and the baked bread was on point. The best part of the space was the backyard garden area. It's peaceful, well lit and are tough to come by in SF. My advice...grab a coffee, disconnect and enjoy the scenery."", ""My husband gets a loaf of fresh bread wherever he can and this was his favorite loaf of bread ever, including what we've gotten at farmer's markets, acme, whole foods, etc. It's surprising this place doesn't have more of a wait since we waited in line on the same day at Tartine forever and thought the pastries and bread here were much better!They have a cute little cafe garden in the back too."", ""Ok, I just read this one review before I'm starting my own review of this place & I'm unpleasantly surprised to learn that they use day old croissants to make their almond croissants? Why?I've visited this place twice while I'm currently working in the area, and I think both visits were good. The pastries that I got were pretty yummy. 1st time I got the Almond Croissant & The Rustic in which I liked the Rustic more. Then 2nd time I got a Mocha, The Rustic, and Apple Frittata (?) in which I liked the Apple one more because it reminds me kinda like an apple pie. Overall this place is pretty rusticly cute, and it's cool they have a patio/backyard area for people to enjoy their pastry & coffee."", ""I have not reviewed this place... How is this possible? First of all, they have the best ham and cheese croissants that I've ever tried, and Lord knows I've tried a lot (including wonderful ones in Paris and Buenos Aires). Do yourself a favor and have some, warmed up. Their carrot cake is divine, as well as their cream puffs, and everything else on display looks wonderful. Their coffee is always delicious and unassuming, this isn't Starbucks after all. Oh! Their almond croissanttttt. Get some of that and thank me later.I've always wanted to sit in their back patio and read a book, but it would appear that I'm not the only person who's had that idea. Every time I have gone it's booked to capacity. Highly recommend this bakery. It makes me and the husband happy and we always stop by when in Castro, once a month. Love!"", ""Many weeks later, I'm still dreaming of the savory scone I spontaneously got at Thorough Bread. You see, I usually find scones dry and tasteless, but there was something about this one that called my name. It made me want to give more scones a chance. (Or maybe I should continue to eat Thorough Bread scones only.)The space inside is pleasant. It's nice to be able to sit close to where the magic happens, and the display of breads and pastries is very inviting.There's an outside patio in the back that has almost as much seating as inside.

I don't know what is going on with all these hipster coffee shops that want to work with office hours instead of hospitality hours. Good way to do business guys.

The tables are big and there's plenty of seats. I ordered an iced latte, and it was perfectly creamy - maybe one of the best lattes I've ever had! The only downfall is the lack of outlets at this place. One of the walls has maybe 3 outlets, while the other wall only has 1 outlet.

There are a lot of excellent cafes and coffee vendors in the area, and comparing Stanza to the wealth of other options makes me think it's just all right. For example, if you are looking for a workspace, the limited seating options and dim lighting makes this place not so inviting to write or read for a long time (I guess an exception would be if you are a cave dweller or a vampire who has foolishly ventured out in the daytime and need a safe space to hide out from the sun). However, the coffee is great, and I usually get my drink to go given the space limitations. My most recent drink was a cortado, and I thought it was well-made; Americanos here have also not disappointed. However, Four Barrel would probably be my preferred coffee option if I'm in the area."", ""Nice quiet place to get some work done.. you can order food from the Mediterranean restaurant next door which is a solid plus.

Love it!', 'This place was A-OK, we were looking for coffee and of course, why not go to an amazing stand alone vs a Sbux if you can? The ordering was easy enough, we walked in and got a cold brew. They immediately brewed up and we got it quickly. I wish I had gotten their amazing looking cookies, specifically the half pb and half chocolate but next time. I took one star off because while the coffee was good it was slightly too acidic for my taste. We sat on their patio which was nice and had a beautiful wall mural but was ridden with a ton of flies. Overall, A-OK.', ""I love the chill vibes that this coffee shop emits. There is relaxing music played in the background (albeit a bit loud and you can clearly hear it even with earphones on unless you have the noise cancelling headphones). The lighting is slightly dim and conveys an intimate setting. \xa0There are outlets on the wall and many people come here to work on their laptops. The interior design of this place is also phenomenal. Very detailed and meticulous, ornate designs placed on the walls. Love it!I ordered the thai iced tea, which was alright. It wasn't very sweet or milky, two things I would have preferred. My boyfriend ordered the cold brew and said it wasn't acidic at all. He thought the drink was particularly good here.

On a Saturday afternoon we were looking forward on sitting out on the patio after ordering our drinks, but it was completely packed. Found a table inside to settle into. Staff was incredibly friendly. Bathroom was very confusing. They had a super advance ticketing system you needed to get from the register, to scan to get into. It was a bit too much.', ""Loved this place - when lots of coffeeshops in SF didn't seem to have wifi, Stanza Coffee saved the day. Aside from having the perfect brew, the wifi was fast and the bathrooms were clean. Everyone was friendly and it was a super comfy place to settle down and work for a little while.

They do have long tables though in case you needed to spread out and it never got super busy, so you didn't feel guilty for staying a little while. The back patio was absolutely gorgeous though and felt like it was a completely different space - it gets the best sunlight, is warm and cozy, and is beautifully designed.

Neighbor Bakehouse,"[""Easily the best sourdough load in the city is their olive loaf. But with exceptional pastries, such a nice staff - there's even more to love even if they do run out of bread. Pro tip: bread often runs out early (before noon) and lines can be 15+ mins. Plan accordingly"", ""This bakery is part of our Saturday morning routine. It's delicious, rain or shine they always have a line, honestly it's worth the wait. Everything is freshly baked, most of the time it's still warm when we get it. The staff is so friendly, and efficient.It's a very small place, limited out outdoor siting."", ""Good but not as outstanding as I expected. The very hyped pistachio blackberry twice-baked croissant is good but not worth a special trip, and I would only come back if in the area.There's no seating inside the bakery but there are many tables outside. However, in the morning (which is the best time for visiting bakeries) the seating area is covered in shade, so it might not be the most pleasant environment for enjoying pastries.From most to least liked, I tried:Recommended:-Pistachio blackberry twice-baked ($4.85)- tastes good because the filling is good - it's moist, sweet, and slightly tart, and the flavors of the pistachio and blackberry go well together. I did think it was a little too sweet, especially with the powdered sugar on top, The croissant itself is slightly dry by itself but is good together with the filling. It is a bit overhyped though - I've had better twice-baked croissants elsewhere (e.g. Baker Doe's).Better than OK:-Butter croissant ($3.50) - very crispy and light. While it does taste of butter, the flavor isn't /super/ buttery and it's a bit on the sweet side. It's good but not as good as I expected, and I think Arsicault Bakery and some bakeries in New York make better versions.-Ginger pull-apart ($4.25) - reminds me of a denser, slightly bread-like kouign amann. The base is coated in sugar, and the bottom half is more syrupy, sticky, and gingery. The ginger flavor overall was not strong.Not recommended:-Mushroom tart ($4.50) - flavorful filling, very cheesy and with a decent amount of mushrooms and onions. The pastry portion was crunchy and kind of flaky. But it was served completely cold (on a warm plate), so the cream-based filling was completely hard and not at all pleasant to eat."", ""I guess this month is all about James Beard noms.

This makes me sound like a druggie, but they're really that amazing and for me, addictive. $34 and ~5min later, lunch was served.The spread: + Passionfruit doughp bun- *fav* despite being a die-hard chocolate lover+ Chocolate pudding doughp bun + Mushroom tart- maybe the least impressive of the 5, but still good+ Croque madam- be warned that egg is runny+ Hot chai lattes The service was quick and neighborly. The ladies behind the counter had great recommendations even though pretty much everything we ordered was excellent. I need to come back for the ham and cheese morning bun & everything croissant.

They're my favorite and I schedule my day around eating them. And there's such a large selection here! The winner in my book? Their smoked ham and cheese morning bun -- nice healthy serving of ham accompanied by a flakey croissant exterior. Yes, a wonderful morning was had indeed. A close runner-up is the savory everything croissant, which is their play on the everything bagel, with the cream cheese inside and everything.For those with a sweet tooth, there are of course all the usual suspects. And if you're looking for something beyond the run-of-the-mill pastry, I'd recommend trying the ginger pull-apart. The ginger and cinnamon are perfectly complementary, neither flavor overpowering the other.Neighbor Bakehouse has this hipster vibe that even I, a self-proclaimed basic, am undoubtedly a fan of. Maybe its the brick wall aesthetic, maybe its the open kitchen where you can see the pastry chefs working their magic. Regardless, park your butt at the outdoor picnic tables after purchasing a box and experience nirvana.--FYI Neighbor Bakehouse nabbed the #3 ranked spot on my bakery blog post (Inhale Carbs, Exhale Satisfaction ft. San Francisco, CA). To read my other pastry recommendations in SF, follow: link.medium.com/QwNg4YQK…"", 'Owned by Greg and Christine Mindel since 2012 there is a good chance anyone enjoying a Pastry inside one of San Francisco\'s top Coffee Shops over the last decade has tasted something from Neighbor Bakehouse, prior wholesale to the likes of Four Barrel and Sightglass eventually yielding a brick-and-mortar storefront early 2015 in the Dogpatch.Formally trained prior to years as a baking instructor, gigs at places such as Tartine benefitting both Mindel and the goods themselves, it is from a distance that Neighbor Bakehouse can be identified from Wednesday through Sunday, a line snaking out the door even with rain and guests almost universally emerging from the standing-room-only space with sizable boxes in their hands and smiles on their faces.Occupying 2343 Third Street, the surrounding buildings largely residential but short-term parking plentiful, it is after queuing that guests will be tempted by nearly three-dozen options ranging from Pizette to Viennesoire, prices competitive with other artisan bakeshops like Mr. Holmes while service is expedient yet pleasant.Known for several signatures, and utilizing most of Neigbor Bakehouse\'s space for production rather than seating, it was targeting diversity that seven items in total were requested, inclement weather necessitating a twenty minute drive across town before clouds would clear so that items beginning with a Muffin-sized Financier with good density and restrained sweetness could be tasted.Open at 6:30am but continuing to bake past 8:00am, the possibility of finding something still-warm a welcome surprise, it was taking advantage of good fortune that two additional Fruit and Nut combinations followed, the Pistachio Blackberry Twice-baked Croissant marvelously constructed with shattering Shell overlying buttery layers thinly spread with Jam while a Raspberry Hazelnut version performed even more admirably thanks to whole Nuts on top plus toasty notes inside that play well off seeded Preserves.Sticking to no script but their own, ""Pumpkin Spice"" season long gone but a slice of Brioche slathered in Puree mixed with Frangipane stunning in its subtlety, those seeking Mindel\'s best use of technique should not pass on a Ginger Pull-apart which eats like laminated Monkey Bread with lots of spice, and although the cleverly named \'Doughp\' (pronounced dope) Bun gets a lot of press it is actually Neighbor\'s Oat Coconut Pecan Chocolate Cookie that showed better as a result of being well balanced despite so much going on and still managing to be crisp around the edges but soft in the center despite so many moist ingredients.', 'Oh my goodness- the ginger gooey bread is delicious, and so are the pistachio blackberry... and the savory breads... and basically every other delightful item that comes out of their ovens. \xa0I am thrilled to have such an amazing bakery in Dogpatch. \xa0 Get there early, as the lines can be long, but are worth the wait!', 'It\'s rare that I give five stars for somewhere, but this place really, hands down, has some of the best pastries. \xa0It could be because they have savory pastries which cater more to my palate as I don\'t indulge in sweets too often. \xa0But truth be told, their pastry selection is solid. \xa0 The things we tried included the following:Cheddar, Chorizo, Black pepper pastryPROS:- flakiest dough I\'ve ever had but yet wasn\'t dry- good amount of filling, not too much cheese, and not too much chorizo- nice amount of black pepper: not overwhelmingCONS:- barely shareable: Maybe between two people, this can be ripped in half, but if you like savory pastries, you can probably easily kill 2 of these on your own.Savory Morning BunPROS:- good amount of seeds: I like seeds, they\'re good for you but they are also a con (see below)- not dry, good flakiness to the dough as wellCONS:- slightly drier than the cheddar chorizo pastry: could be because that was more of a croissant dough and may have had more butter. \xa0On that note, this is probably healthier.- seeds (too much for me): I personally do not like too many seeds because they get stuck all over. \xa0The coffee did help to wash it down, but for someone who has tight cheeks like me, my tongue ends up doing extra work to try and get it out.The selection of pastries is amazing. \xa0They literally had a rack right behind the counter of fresh pastries coming right out of the oven. \xa0It\'s definitely worth going. \xa0They also open early so get there early because reputation usually lends itself to selling out of the good stuff. \xa0Parking wasn\'t too bad when we went but then again, the early bird gets the worm. \xa0Service is relatively quick - most things are served immediately if they are behind the counter. \xa0Beverages that take some time to custom order get called out or sometimes served. \xa0There is outdoor seating which can kind of get a little chilly, but it\'s spacious still. \xa0The area is cute and clean, given that it\'s Dogpatch it may be ""out of the way"" for some people, but definitely worth the drive.', ""Highly recommended! Just about everything here is extremely well done. I've always loved their everything croissants that four barrel has, and have been meaning to come here for months. Had the triple onion pastry, it had a nice cheese and caramelized onions inside, and crispy/baked inions on the outside, and sesame seeds on top. Holy shito, it was good. The coffee cake pastry with raspberry jam inside was so delicious. \xa0The coffee crumb flavor was better than most coffee cakes I've had. Plus it was on this pastry with a moist, buttery flavor. And she's jam inside was cherry on top."", ""One of the only bakeries in the area that's opened early, so I stopped by before work one morning (I mean, it was highly suggested that you come early because all the good stuff sells out early). And I mean, what's better than freshly baked bread in the crisp morning area filling your lungs? Money in your wallet, that's what. But it's worth every penny. First, always support your local businesses and Neighbor Bakehouse is the epitome of that. I'm honestly not that into bread or baked goods for breakfast, but something told me the string of 4-5 star consistent reviews, there has to be something worth my hard earned money. Once you see the bricks, you know you're there! There most likely will be a ling since the interior is tiny! You walk right in and you stare at trays of baked goods (with labels) of course and somebody barks at you to order. You get worried and panic a little and all the things you wanted to order, you forget and then end up over ordering and end up with one of everything! That's basically what happens to me each time, but it's worth the calories. My favorite is the everything croissant- I don't know how they do it, but it's simply amazing. So buttery and flaky with cream cheese on the inside. It's like biting into heaven. I'm a savory type of person and I love morning buns, but theirs with ham & cheese just wasn't for me. Not enough filling and just too doughy. I'll stick with a sweet morning bun please. Their twice-baked is absolutely delicious and great over coffee and for sharing (but it's kind of hard, so more for dipping and those who enough a little extra crunch).Tiny shop, but they make the most amazing breads and coffee to go with it. Just a fantastic find here in the city- it's a must try! They do take card and cash. Nothing beats warm buns in the SF chills early in the morning. On sunny days, there's benches outside that you can sit on as well!"", ""I stopped here to pick up some pastries for a company social event. The guy behind the counter was very helpful in giving recommendations and assisting with choosing a variety to hit the budget I was working with.Since these pastries were for the office, I had to show some restraint and not be 100% my usual gluttonous self (sigh) by eating everything, but everything that I did get to try was excellent:The chocolate chip cookie had a nice saltiness to it and the chocolate croissant was one of the better ones I've had in the city. Not quite as good as Arsicault (my favorite), but roughly on par with Tartine and better than Mr. Holmes.Great place to stop by if you're in this part of town!"", ""After all the hype from reviewers on Yelp and word of mouth, I'm sadly disappointed by the baked goods at Neighbor Bakehouse. I had the ginger pull apart, meat pizzetta and raspberry hazelnut double baked croissant to share with my pastry companion. Maybe I'm being too harsh comparing Neighbor to my experiences at B, Arizmendi and Arsicault but it didn't quite cut it in my bakery rankings.The ginger pull apart didn't have enough butter so it tasted a bit dry and stale even though it had clearly been made the same day. The pizzetta was a poorly constructed with high quality ingredients but lacking in seasoning and flavor. I kept wishing I had saved my calories for Arizmendi's sourdough pizza instead. The raspberry croissant was alright with a nice berry taste from the dried raspberry powder on top and gooey hazelnut almond paste in the center. All in all, it's a nice bakery for the Dogpatch and Potrero Hill neighborhood with a pleasant seating area and a decent selection of items. I wouldn't go out of my way to come out here as the pastries just weren't up to my expectations."", ""I hear people talking about the long lines at this place, yet I haven't experienced those yet. Maybe because I come really early in the morning or just before they're closing? (Must be all the techies living in this Area who don't roll out of bed until 9am!)Anyways, I really like this place. Their baked goods, of course, are a delight and I've yet have to have an item that I didn't like. My go-to is the sourdough bread - the one in square format. Ideally they will slice it for me so that i can just put it in a plastic bag and pop it into the freezer: it's delicious for breakfast on the weekends as it pairs so well with my homemade blackberry jam. Aside from their baked goods though, I love the workers' attitude here: I frequent a lot of bakeries all throughout San Francisco and one thing I always note is that the people working their are not very friendly. To the point of being snotty. Here at Neighbor Bakehouse I have only experienced friendly smiles and a welcoming attitude."", ""Neighbor Bakehouse, you never bor me away. This is my all time favorite bakery in San Francisco. Situated right off 3rd street with an expansive outdoor seating area by San Francisco standards, this bakery is hard to miss on weekends as the wait is usually in the range of 20-45 minutes, depending on the time of day. With fresh baked batches of assorted pastries made on site every hour or so, the aromas of the varying depths of flavors - berries; chocolate; pear; ginger; roasted nuts - burst through the air and grab your soul. My favorite picks are:(1) The Cinnamon Almond Bostock - I love this pastry because it is a cross between a French toast and a croissant - the child that got the best genes from both parents. Crisp and buttery on the outside, soft layered and airy on the inside, with the flavor of the roasted almonds and cinnamon throughout. \xa0The perfect start to any day. (2) The ginger pull apart - The way this bread is twisted not only makes this bread a fun pull apart to share with friends, but it is also positioned as to maximize the surface area and optimize the crunch effect - and add to that the flavor of the fiery ginger. This is another classic. (3) The Twice Baked Croissants - I really enjoy the various flavors of the twice makes. The way that the berries complement the herbs, all baked inside a twice baked croissant for that added crunchy texture makes for a complex flavor combination with varying debts of texture. (4) The Kimchee Toast - On top the buttery, fresh thick milk toast are the tart kimchee, scallions, and cheese. \xa0Though I have a sweet tooth, I quite enjoy the savory bread on occasion. \xa0The one thing that makes this one more enjoyable is reheating it - else the kimchee-cheese-scallion is easy to separate from the toast and the situation gets messy. The tea and coffee are also carefully made cup by cup - a good wake up call. Neighbor Bakehouse, I'm so happy we are neighbors."", ""We were craving baked goods after brunch and found this gem on Yelp. There were only a few baked goods left since we stopped by 30 minutes before closing. After being introduced to double baked croissants in Vancouver, I have been trying to find them again and saw that they had twice baked croissants. I ordered the pistachio blackberry twice baked croissant AND OMG IT WAS GOOD. The first bite was crispy from the pistachios on top and the croissant. The pistachio and blackberry layers were weaved on top of each other and the flavor combination really worked well together. However, I wish the pistachio and blackberry ratio was more even because I felt like there was more pistachio than blackberry. Can't wait to try their other twice baked croissants!"", ""Neighbor Bakehouse has the best pastries I've ever stuffed in my face on American soil. The bakery is a stone's throw away from Dogpatch Boulders, so you can easily get your climb on and then your pastry on.I've been here twice with my friend now. Both times the line has been out the door, even in the rain. The first time we got the (1) Ginger Pull-apart, (2) Raspberry Hazelnut twice-baked, (3) Passionfruit Doughp Bun. The second time we got the (1) Everything Croissant and the (2) Guava & Cream Cheese Pastelito. My experiences here have made me question how this place even exists.

San Francisco is really far for me otherwise I'd go every day."", ""Who needs a rebel within when you can be a bear without? There are far too many ways to enjoy a soft boiled egg than hidden inside a muffin. But a nice travel cake or cocoa nib financier in sizes petite enough for a baby bear? That's a good deal at $4 each. Add on a green oolong tea and there is even room for a $9 green pill pastry from the glass case with lime leaf custard, mango cream, and vanilla for later. Is it America's Best $15 Road Trip Adventure Meal? A burger and beer at Black Sands Brewery in the Lower Haight might be better. If it's after 11am.

I've had their sea salt chocolate chip cookie, croissant, travel cakes, and other pastries, and would honestly recommend all of them! One pastry ranges from $3-$5 while the cakes can get expensive at $8 a slice. They also have loaves of Japanese milk bread here for purchase. There's seating inside for maybe 20-30 and also a bathroom that doesn't require a code or purchase, which is neat.

I have yet to try any of the sweets on their counter, but everything looks fantastic!ProTip: 10% off if you check in on Yelp', ""Egg in muffin?? Revolutionary. Cut the Rebel in half and revel in the ooey gooey egg perfection. It came piping hot and fresh and ok I was truly excited for this moment more than the average person would be but it was nothing short of great. The muffin was delicious, cheesy and savory, but had the perfect texture to contain the egg and soak the yolk up as well. My only downside was that it was too filling and I had to stop myself. Latte was delicious and the perfect company to breakfast. Their pastry case was full of yummy interesting goods that I will have to try one day if I could ever turn down the Rebel.

The decor is super cute and super modern. Which means clean aesthetics.I opted for the latte with almond milk, and let's just say the coffee here is super strong.

The main attractions seem to be their Stone ($9) and Satellite pastries ($ugh don't even look), as curious as the name suggests, an aesthetically pleasing dessert of firm outer shell, soft and deliciously flavored filling, nestled on a bed of nuts and granola. The flavors change every so often, but I haven't been disappointed yet!If you have the willpower to look away, be sure to check out their other pastries, all delightful and unique. Their seasonal Alfajores Kougin Amann filled with Dulce de Leche ($5) is crunchy, flaky, and just the right amount of sweet. For those with time and money to whittle away plus a stomach to fill, their all-day breakfast menu seems equally appetizing. Regret not getting something while in store? For better or for worse, you can order pretty much everything on the menu via Caviar. But there's definitely an upcharge. Craftsman and Wolves seems equally loved by Insta-foodies and nerds, and what both these groups share in common, besides living off of craft beer and coffee, is their attraction to places with Wi-Fi.

It comes out warm, it\'s surprisingly savory and the egg is always cooked perfectly (my preference for eggs is always slightly runny, so I\'m always very pleased with the texture of the egg inside). The pickled carrots (that\'s what I\'m assuming they are) actually balance out the pastry incredibly well because it is a tad on the salty side, and it\'s got sausage in it so it\'s a bit heavy. I wasn\'t a huge fan of the coffee here, I thought the mocha was too sweet (or maybe I\'m just used to the dandelion mocha at Ritual) but I highly recommend coming here and at least trying their famous muffin with an egg in it if you\'ve never been before.

Part of my dissatisfaction is that I think other bakeries in the Bay have spoiled me. Stop any local resident with a sweet tooth who lacks an aversion to carbs, and they can probably name at least 3 bakeries that consistently put out excellent croissants or other typical patisserie fare. I think my mistake with Craftsman and Wolves is that I did not try their striking tarts and went for simple items like their donut holes and morning bun (it's also possible that these items lose their freshness later in the day).

Need to come back to try their empanadas which are not available until 10am.', ""I have passed this place on the train for months and have been patiently waiting for them to open. My first time in today did not disappoint!! I absolutely LOVE the handpainted sign on the front of the building and the decor of the inside of the restaurant. I ordered the sweet churros and three empenadas (Jamon y queso, Pollo picante, and tres quesos). The three cheese empenada was absolutely A M A Z I N G because it included blue cheese inside of it which I wasn't expecting. For anyone who doesn't know me I am obsessed with all cheese especially the stinky ones! Everything felt very reasonably priced and everything we had was so dang tasty! Their menu also included breakfast sandwiches + coffee, beer, wine, and some non alcoholic drinks. I am so freaking excited for this restaurant to be a part of the community!!!!"", ""So happy to see a place like this in this neighborhood! You can get espresso coffees, beer, wine, churros, and empanadas. It's a bright space that seems like a happy place to hang out in.We tried the churros with dulce de leche, empanada picante, and Sightglass brewed coffee. Everything was fresh and tasty! They had their grand opening on March 23 and are still working out kinks in stock (several items were out of stock at 10am). However, I'm sure they will dial-in soon.The owner is wonderful and attentive."", ""Fresh, delicious Argentine empanadas in the Outer Sunset?! Who would have guessed?!Unfortunately, I gave up meat for Lent so I only tried the spinach and cream empanadas, but they were heaven. As my boyfriend said, their dough is perfection. They also have both dessert and savory churros, sandwiches, a full coffee bar, and Bare Bottle beer. The barista made me a delicious hot chocolate that definitely tasted special.The decor is well-done and homey; farm-style with tables and bright blue walls. It fits perfectly in the Outer Sunset and is definitely family-friendly. The owners are a husband-wife couple; one grew up in the Sunset and the other in Argentina. I definitely recommend a stop here, especially since it's right off the L-Line!"", 'The churros are well made for me I wish the sold a side of cinnamon with sugar. We had coffee and hot chocolate what is expected. The empanada was very tasty.', ""Oooh, something new on Taraval!! Came in around 11am, ordered 2 empanadas and was not disappointed! They aren't as dense as other empanadas I've had, but the crust was amazing. Got a little oil on my leg, but it was worth it. Definitely coming back to try the churros and coffee :)"", 'Cute empanada shop! Came here for a quick snack on a Saturday afternoon. My boyfriend and I shared 3 empanadas, ham and cheese, carne, and the spinach and cheese. \xa0They were all super crispy and piping hot. Ham and cheese was super cheesy, all kinds of cheese pulls after each bite which I liked, but there was very little ham inside and I could barely taste it. Carne was tasty, full of beef, and very flavorful from the spices, peppers, and onion. This one was one of my favorites and I look forward to trying the Carne Picante my next trip!Spinach and cheese, was the opposite of the ham and cheese, it was LOADEDDD with spinach with less cheese. Still yummy.Overall everything was pretty good, I felt like it was a tad pricey for the size of each empanada, but if I was in the area looking for a snack I would come back again.', ""Empenandas were great! Coffee was good. WiFi isn't up yet, recently opened in the past 3 weeks, and a quite location to study! Note: I believe there are no plugs.Will update this post in a few weeks"", 'Ordered their champignones and carne dulce empanadas. Overall it was pretty good. Not too oily. Perfect amount of filling.

I walked in at 9:47 with the intention of ordering 12 or so empanadas and some churros. I was told they can\'t take empanada orders till 10am. So I can\'t order. And was further told they can\'t just take the order and - even if they don\'t start making till 10am because the kitchen gets overwhelmed. There was no sorry for the inconvenience or anything, \xa0all she said was ""you\'ll just have to wait a couple of minutes"" and turned around to continue doing what she was doing. This could have been (barely) excusable if they posted clear signs that you can\'t order certain items on the menu before a certain time, but there wasn\'t. The cashier in fact had to reconfirm this \'policy\' before saying anything. \xa0They surely went interested in selling me anything this morning, so good luck with business. From the pics on yelp, this seems like this is a place people would like to instagram, provided they can actually order anything in the morning.', ""Finally there is a place in the bay area that sells authentic churros just like how it suppose to taste like the ones in Madrid, reminescense of \xa0Chocolatería San Ginés. If you've already tried the standard churros in SF, this porras are a thicker, more doughy version and well worth a try. This delectable treat may not seem like it would be that addictive, but it really is - once you start dipping, you may eat several churros sticks without even realizing it.As well, this place also sells authentic Argentinian empanadas. The empanadas here reminds of the ones I ate at El Sanjuanino in Bueno Aires. You get the option of either fried or baked, I love both. There were all sorts of empanadas on the menu, such as carne, carne picante, pollo and various vegetarians ones such as provolone, espinaca, choclo, and champignones.I have traveled to numerous places around the world and ate at many outstanding restaurants and I can say this place is legit.

U :Dessert Story,"[""This place is incredible! It's a dessert-only restaurant occupying the original Ike's Place location that has an incredible variety of really cool desserts.Make a reservation when available, otherwise be ready to stand in line for 30-40 minutes. These guys are making much better use of the space than Ike's. Tables in every crevice of the place and all of them are packed.We started with the Young Coconut Pandan Crepe cake. This was a series of coconut flavored crepes piled on top of each other which you can then drizzle with a sweet coconut sauce. It had a really delicate flavor and just melted in your mouth. In a place like this, this was probably the most conventional dessert you could order.Next up was the Thai Tea Lava Toast. This was sort-of like a bread bowl dessert soup. A Brioche bowl filled with this yummy Thai Tea sauce and lots of brioche chunks and then topped with Thai Tea flavored ice cream, whipped cream, and nuts. This was the best dessert of the night. Absolute must have. Kinda like a pre-soaked dessert fondue. So good!!The final dish was the Igloos Kakigōri. This was a giant pile of shaved ice with a marshmallow-ey exterior and served with a kiwi sauce and some sort of condensed milk that you are supposed to occasionally re-drench the igloo with. To start it off, they set it on fire with some kind of alcohol which makes it a really fun dessert to order. As you keep digging inside the snow, you discover it is actually filled with some sort of lychee balls that sort-of explode in your mouth. This is a lot of fun to eat.Need to come back here and try everything else on their menu."", 'I was looking forward to go here !!!Finally I got the chance!!!The desserts here are so good! Yummy and good for taking pictures LolOur favorite is Mango Sticky Rice Toast!!!!The people here are so friendly:)We will come again to try something new', ""- Coconut pandan crepe cake: without the sauce it comes with, you don't really taste much & just be chewing on the coconut. With the sauce, this is just a coconut crepe cake. Not much pandas flavor- Thai tea float: a little thick consistently, not too sweet, really good.- Mango bingsoo:Love the seed and caramelized coconut on top, gives a nice crunch. The shave ice underneath has a subtle sweet coconut taste which is good because most places is just straight ice or milk. Very refreshing. \xa0 - Great place to take photos because the natural lighting & decorations. Even the desserts are insta-worthy"", 'A rare breed indeed. \xa0A full service restaurant (not merely a bakery or sweet shop) that focuses on desserts. \xa0And a nice departure from the European-centric patisseries around town as the menu here is very Asian influenced. \xa0Everything I had was delicious with a few items ranking in the most memorable desserts ever.Igloos Kakigori: This was so much entertainment to watch. \xa0The outer meringue is browned a bit already, but they finish it off by pouring a flaming liquid on top. \xa0Tastes a bit like s\'mores when it\'s all done. \xa0Really loved the fresh kiwi syrup poured over the shaved ice and eaten alongside the meringue, it was like like a frozen kiwi version of a key lime pie. \xa0The condensed milk poured on top worked nicely too. \xa0At the bottom was the nice surprise of little balls filled with what seemed to be lychee. \xa0This dessert looked massive, but it wasn\'t overfilling thanks to all the ice.Matcha Crepe Cake: I\'m not stranger the multi-layer crepe cake. \xa0I\'ve had it at many venues with many different fillings. \xa0The matcha here was intense. \xa0Like not just some sweet cream with a tiny bit of matcha. \xa0It was almost like matcha paste, there was so much powder going on. \xa0On one hand it was a nice contrast to the other desserts which are really sweet. \xa0But some folks at our table thought it was too bitter.Thai Tea Lava Toast: This surprised me. \xa0It looked like another incarnation of Japanese-style Honey Bread. \xa0And in a way it was, since the box was nicely toasted and full of buttery goodness. The bread cubes inside rode that fine line of being somewhat crispy, but also fluffy inside. \xa0But the surprise came with the massive amount of Thai Tea flavored ""lava"". \xa0After getting our photos, we cracked it open and that delicious sauce covered most of the massive plate. \xa0The bread bits helped soak up a bunch and it was also nice dipping in some fruit, almost like fondue. \xa0Definitely took this style of dessert to the next level!', ""Great spot for a dessert date. Their desserts are definitely Instagram worthy. This place is small. You can make reservations on yelp in advance, if you like.I came here with my boyfriend on a Sunday afternoon. Thankfully, this place wasn't packed, we got sat down immediately. Downside, the tables or floor had a strong bleach smell which made me lose my appetite, a little. It was tough deciding what to get. So many things we could order but we decided to order their Thai Tea Toast and Matcha Lava cake. The lava cake came first. It was DELICIOUS! You have to order this treat when come here. Highly recommend. The cake and matcha flavor was perfectly paired, the green tea ice cream on the side was cherry on top. Presentation, of course, BEAUTIFUL.The Thai Tea Toast was good, but I thought it was overwhelming. It was topped with whipped cream and a scoop of thai tea ice cream. The bottom was toast cubes with tons of Thai flavor cream. The cream on the bottom was warm, so it melted the ice cream really fast. I had to scoop some of the lava cream out, it was too much.Overall, loved the cute concept. Pricing wise, it's on the higher end. We spent about $30 on just two desserts, no regrets. It was delicious, and no doubt I'll be coming back for more."", ""What can I say about U: Desert Story but U need to go check them out for their interestingly savory deserts. I wish I could post the video that I took of me cutting open the match chocolate lava cake and how the matcha lava just poured out. It was such a beautiful site. While there I witnessed several other deserts that were ordered by other customers and each one has its own uniqueness and flare, and for some of the deserts it was literally flare with flames. I will definitely visit again and try out some more deserts. I recommend U checking them out if you're in the area looking for a unique desert spot in San Francisco.#travelnurseswithoutboarders"", ""My friends have been talking about U:Dessert Story and how unique and pretty their desserts are for some time now. So, I decided this past weekend to go check it out for myself. I made reservations via the Yelp app and it was quick and easy. We came here on a Saturday late afternoon and there was just a slight wait. The place was fully packed and i wasn't surprised at the least.I shared the Young Coconut Pandan Crepe Cake and their Mango Sticky Rice Bingsoo. First of all, I want to say the Mango Sticky Rice Bingsoo was so so good. The Bingsoo is finely shaved ice and you can add as much condensed milk to sweeten it to your liking. I highly recommend this to share and I would come back just for this item. However, the Pandan Crepe Cake was very blah and I actually did not like this item at all. I definitely would not order this again or recommend you do either.Our waiter was quick and all of the staff were moving quickly while we were there. The interior is simple but cool to look at. There is a selfie wall with their branding on the wall where you would wait for a seat, which is along the right wall when you walk in. Their desserts are all over instagram as they photograph very well. I'm sure I'll be back soon to try more of their sweet menu."", 'Loved the matcha chocolate lava cake-- rich, sweet, dense and creamy. May have not been worth ~$13 (more expensive than my lunch that day) but I have no regrets!The cheese tea is pretty good and there is a lot of cheese if that\'s your vibe.Didn\'t really enjoy the thai tea crepe cake as much. Texture slightly rubbery but then again I\'ve never had a crepe cake before so maybe that is how it is supposed to be? The flavor and sweetness mainly came from the custardy bit which allowed me to control the sweetness. Wish they had more of that though!As for wait time, it was pretty reasonable. There was no line when I went and I also didn\'t make a reservation. We got seated at the ""bar"" immediately.', '4.5 stars. Finally an Asian inspired unique dessert place in the neighborhood with loungy relaxing vibes. This one is a Japanese Thai dessert place sitting right in the middle of Castro. \xa0We passed by and decided to give it a go before dinner because it smelled amazing when we walked in to check it out. We got the matcha crepe cake which was delicious. Not too sweet - just how I liked it. \xa0A bit of bitterness from the goodness of matcha. Fantastic combination of matcha, red bean, and soft layered cake. The only suggestion that I had was to make the mille feuille pastry component more flaky and structured so you could actually taste the 20 layers when you are biting into it. We also saw the next table getting the volcanic Thai \xa0shaved ice and it looked good. The next table devoured it pretty quickly which is always a great sign.', 'Love this place! My friend and I went here for dessert after grabbing a bite at Super Duper. Luckily we were able to grab a reservation so we didnt have to wait that long. But they still made us wait for about 15 minutes. This place gets super packed so I highly recommend getting reservations. I got the matcha lava cake and the iced matcha latte and my friend got the Thai Tea crepe cake. Everything was so yummy and had the cutest presentation. My fave has got to be the Thai tea crepe! It was so light and spongey almost. The thai tea flavor wasnt too overpowering either and it wasnt too sweet. Cant wait to come back and try more things!', ""All of the reviews are true. U Dessert is BOMB!My friends and I came here on Friday after dinner around 7pm and only needed to wait for 5 minutes for a table of 3.

I cannot stress enough how reservations are highly recommended. I came here a few days ago without one and it was quite terrible. There's two lines, a second line to acknowledge that they know you're waiting. Then you get to the first line and now they can see you waiting...What I hate is when there is a long line at a restaurant and groups who are done eating are just sitting there talking...we were in line for at least 1.5 hours and when we left, this group of ladies was still there...talking....? Anywho, desserts are super yummy. I've had the thai tea millecrepe and the mango sticky rice bingsoo. Both of which are amazingly delicious. Not to mention, everything here is instagrammable ;) No parking in this area, usually takes 20 min to circle around or longer."", ""Delicious but totally and ridiculously overpriced! \xa0For that, I'd have to deduct a star. \xa0Also, some of the tables were placed way too close to one another creating some discomfort for the customers. \xa0For that reason, I'd have to deduct half a star.The service was excellent. \xa0The waiters were all super professional and very friendly.For the food, my bf and I ordered Mango Sticky Rice Bingsoo and Thai Tea Crepe Cake. \xa0I'd have to deduct half a star for the crepe cake, please read the details below.The Mango Sticky Rice Bingsoo was absolutely heavenly. \xa0The shaved ice was milky and smooth. \xa0The sticky rice was chewy, sweet, and topped with crunchy toasted coconut (I think).The Thai Tea Crepe Cake was just meh. \xa0One good thing was the whole dessert wasn't too sweet. \xa0But the crepe itself was too dry. \xa0There were some parts of the cake where the crepe wasn't covered by any cream, so I got to try and taste the crepe just by itself. \xa0And it unfortunately wasn't good. \xa0And it cost you $12. \xa0I wouldn't order it ever again. \xa0Sorry."", ""Cute little place with yummy desserts.

They only offered it in their small size, which was for perfect for my friend and as we got the small mango as well.

Mango bingsoo ( mango was Tart, but perfect combo since the durian was sweet, also comes with sticky rice) Can't wait to come back and try more!"", ""Snow cream is my kryptonite and Dessert Story delivers and excels. First thing first- the menu just has too many delicious options. We spent 5 minutes debating what we wanted because everything looked great. Ultimately, we were able to decide on the coconut crepe cake and the mango sticky rice bingsoo- both were delicious. I really have difficulty deciding which was my favorite.Only issues I have with Dessert Story is that the space is small and the wait can be brutal- we lucked out and only had to wait 10 minutes on a Wednesday night.Then again, Na Ya, the other dessert house with similar quality items also suffers from a brutal wait so there's really no winning. Luckily, you can make reservations here so that's probably the best call. The other issue I have is the drinks are so pricey!!! I wish they were cheaper, but whatever.Still my favorite dessert spot in the Castro."", 'Husband: ""But you just had dessert.....You want to go to another place for even more dessert?""Me: 8} Even if you JUST HAD dessert, this place is absolutely worth a second pit stop. So far, I adore the tempting Korean-Japanese-Thai style dessert and beverage selections from here. Come in a group so you can try a bunch of different items! During my visit, I ordered the Pandan Crepe Cake with house made young coconut sauce on the side. By the way, this jizz sauce makes the cake; use all of it. I love how this cake and the accompanying sauce weren\'t cloyingly sweet. I also ordered an iced Matcha Latte, which was perfect! The organic matcha comes from Japan\'s Encha Uji Farm, so its gotta be legit.

The pandan had a balanced flavor, not to sweet and not too soupy: the bread was abundant and very soft. It was delicious! The Mango Bingsoo was incredible! There were large pieces of tart mango and a nice amount of condensed milk. They also included more condensed milk on the side which was super nice. The combination of the two desserts was epic and I would come here again and again for them! The girls working the day we came we're sweet and super helpful.

Hopefully they switch up the food more often because it made me hesitant about how sanitary this place really is.First impression is that this place is boujee, but I like how modern and bright the atmosphere is. It feels very open and friendly.I got the Salmon Toast ($9) and the Matcha Latte ($5.5). I enjoyed the toast a lot. It came in this fancy looking blue box and made the experience feel special. I like the smoked salmon and the cream cheese was super delicious. They gave a lot of cream cheese too which was nice.The latte wasn't really my thing because it wasn't sweet enough.

I decided to check out their Aussie iced latte since after some research, this is an Australian inspired coffee shop. I got it with oat milk, and overall, I really liked it. Same goes for the salmon toast, where all the ingredients are fresh and they put it into a very nice takeout box, similar to when you pull something out of a drawer. It's pretty cute I guess.This time I am far from disappointed. I really enjoyed the food and drink as well as the customer service. I would go back again sometime, when I decide to splurge a little, because this is a very pricey place that would have set me back $19+ if it weren't for the promo and free coffee. Thanks for giving yourself a second chance; you earned back a customer :)"", ""Great spot to catch up with friends over coffee and brunch in San Francisco Financial district. Love their ambience. The interior is so tiny, bright, modern, and Instagram worthy. Also, the coffee and toasts are amazing!!Ordered for 3 ppl:Drinks：Latte: (4.5/5): \xa0good quality coffee beans.Golden Latte (?/5): Not a big fan of cinnamon, and no dare to try a sip. ://Food:Avocado Toast (5/5): The best in the town!!! Love their avocado Toast recipe, fresh smash avocado seasoned w/ lemon juice, salt&pepper , chili flakes &olive oil!! The roast of toast just prefect. Tips: I would like to add some extra on the top next time, such as prosciutto or poached egg. Salmon Toast (4/5): according to my friends' comments. It tastes good but too creamy. Breakfast Bowl (4/5): kale, avocado, cherry tomato, red quinoa & poached egg. Hmmmm.. I can feel the healthiness from the breakfast bowl. Maybe few drop of lemon juice would make the salad bowl taste even better. Croissant (5/5): yummy! Crispy and buttery. Very match with the latte."", ""I went here twice over the weekend. 1. The coffee is great. If you're a blue bottle fan (I am), this is equally good. 2. I also tried the matcha latte on the second day that I went here, it was good. 3. My favourite here was the avocado toast. Nothing complex, simple bread with generous spread of fresh avocados served with salt and paprika drizzle on top. My only minor complaint is that they charge you $1 extra for making your drink extra hot. I find that a bit strange. Else the place is a definitely worth a stop to grab a small bite or get a coffee."", ""I've tried this place a few times for breakfast and I consider it one of my go-to breakfast places when I want to treat myself. Cute little venue, great quality (and fairly healthy) food, nice and attentive staff, slightly pricey menu. I've tried the signature avo toast (with and without poached egg), Australian iced coffee, salmon toast, raspberry almond croissant, chocolate chip cookie, and the lemon blueberry muffin. The toasts are the best thing you could order. Steep price at $9, but it's honestly the best toasts hands down. The bread they use is fantastic in texture with a great balance of chewy, fluffiness and a nutty, toasty exterior. The slice is actually pretty large in size, cut thick, and placed in a cute little box. Both the avo toast and the salmon toast are tasty, but between the two, I prefer the avo toast. Both are pretty generous in toppings and are great quality, but I enjoy the flavors more in the avo toast personally (creamy, citrusy, spicy). The egg is great, a worth-while addition. As for the pastries, I enjoyed them all. The raspberry almond croissant was the most beautiful and my favorite of the three although it was a little too sweet. The lemon blueberry muffin is my next favorite for the simplicity in flavors and sugary, crusty top. The cookie was meant to be eaten with coffee, not on its own which made it less appealing for me since I don't always get coffee. I ordered the Australian iced coffee just because I was curious to know what it was and didn't bother to ask. It's vanilla ice cream in a cup of iced coffee! Actually really great, but not something I would order in the morning often. Overall, a great little cafe worth trying. I'll be back, especially for the avo toast."", ""I've been to one of these in NY so I was excited to try the one here. I went for brunch/lunch with my friend on a Saturday at 12pm. It was starting to empty out, so we were able to get seats. Tables are pretty close together, so seating is a bit tight. I ordered the Market bowl (~$14), which was the same as the Breakfast Bowl (~$14, which my friend got) except had beets, corn, and cucumber. It's a little pricy and something I could make at home, but I do like the combination and it was plated very nicely. My only thing is that while pretty, the avocado did not seem ripe enough yet, and did not taste ripe either. A bit expensive for what it is, but I would come here again for a healthy brunch."", ""Came here per the suggestion of a friend and ordered an Americano for about $5 before tip, which is expensive. It was a decent Americano though. My friend had the avocado toast and an iced coffee for almost as expensive. I guess you're paying for the location. The avocado toast was yummy and served on good bread, which is a plus, but is it worth the price? Meh. The atmosphere is nice, though, and has such great colors for being right next to an alley of homeless people. I don't know if I'll ever choose to come back, but it could be a nice place to have coffee with friends that isn't Starbucks."", ""The first Bluestone Lane I ever tried was in the Financial District in New York and now I'm so happy to see Bluestone Lanes popping up all over the place - even here, in SF! I dropped by on a Friday morning for some avo toast and a golden milk latte. I hadn't had one of these since New York and I was really craving a delicious turmeric drink! Overall, I was pleased by the service (which is amazing!) and the ambiance of the store. It looks lively but also not too much so, as people are able to get their work done in here. The price point is again, quite steep but it's to be expected here in San Francisco. I'd love to return and try some of their coffee here next time!"", ""I love impressing my friends with Yelp discoveries. I'm now the default person for picking places for food and drink, including a 7:00 AM breakfast that my friends and I met up for. Bluestone seemed adorable, and who in San Francisco doesn't love overpriced toast?Pretty sure Bluestone is Australian, judging from the wait staff accents and the vegemite on the menu. Everyone is super sweet, and I love the cute and classy atmosphere. My friend saved seats for the rest of us to arrive. I'd recommend groups of 2 to 4 people max since it's a tight fit. It was surprisingly busy for a weekday morning.We all ordered hot coffee, which came in a glass carafe aside a colorful ceramic mug. For breakfast I got the avocado toast, which was delicious and filling. Whenever we needed something, it seemed like I had to make an effort to flag someone down, but the actual process of ordering and paying was seamless.While I wouldn't rush to come here again, I truly enjoyed my experience and would recommend it to anyone looking for a new spot to check out in the Financial District. It's a few blocks away from Embarcadero Center, and it's open super early! Definitely lots of notable wins."", ""Nice place for a coffee! I went in with the purpose of getting a latte but decided to go for the mocha instead. The mocha was good, enough chocolate and coffee taste. Glad that it wasn't too sweet ! The one caveat is that the place isn't large and doesn't have much seating. Every time I've come the place is quite full and here's always a line. Usually it doesn't take too long but other times it does. Either way, I've always had a good experience coming in and I'd recommend the mocha and the latte. I love that they serve milo, didn't know it was popular in Australia as it is in South America. Will be back!"", ""Fantastic coffee! I met up a buddy of my for coffee and he suggested this place. The cold brew is strong and smooth, as they all should be. Iced and black is how I prefer my coffee. It's slightly pricy for coffee, but I love how places like this thrive in the big city. It was a Tuesday morning, and packed with people taking a break from their busy workday. The place was packed, and the only option was to take our coffee to go. I can't complain though, as it was such a nice day to be walking around the city.I paid with a credit card, and intended to tip with cash but realized that they don't have a tip jar.....Umm y'all should get one."", ""I went for some coffee and was denied service because they wouldn't accept cash. Cash is US currency and is legal tender for all debts, public and private. I'm done with this place. This is discrimination at its best"", 'I came in by invite from Sarah, the wonderful manager who is responding to my feedback from a previous experience at Bluestone Lane. She more than compensated for the mishap the first time, and she was incredibly polite in explaining to me the situation while also taking ownership and addressing my concerns. Regarding the food and drinks, I probably had one of the best slices of avocado toast in my life. The thick yet soft and chewy multigrain toasted bread Supported a bed of smashed avocado along with a perfectly poached egg. The entire creation was drizzled with olive oil and topped with chili flakes. I recommend you eat the toast as soon as possible as the bread will still be warm as well as the egg on top. At this location specifically, you can either dine in with table service, or you can order from the counter. The Bright interior Decour filled with wooden tables plants and glass bottles just feels comforting and clean, and creates a pleasant daytime dining experience. The tables are a little squeezed together, but it does not detract from the meal, as it feels more intimate and cozy than crowdedThey have Wifi as well, and I look forward to coming back.']","['5.0 star rating', '3.0 star rating', '3.0 star rating', '3.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '3.0 star rating', '3.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '3.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '1.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating']"
Jane The Bakery,"[""My favorite bakery in SF!I'm here 3 times a week for fresh bread. The polenta/olive loaf, fig walnut and sourdough are all perfect.The best kept secret \xa0at Jane's is the Roasted Cauliflower Sandwich."", ""The first time I stopped at their bakery location, when it first opened, it must have been an off day because I couldn't find any vegan options. This was surprising because their regular locations always had muffins, cookies, etc.However, having gone more recently, I was delighted to find a few different cookie options and muffin. My partner got the chocolate chip cookie and I got the blueberry banana muffin. And that muffin was seriously one of the best vegan ones I've had in a while. All too often vegan muffins can be on the dry side. But the fruit in this muffin was plentiful and gave it the perfect consistency.Now that I know to look here for vegan pastries, I'll also need to try some of their breads. The loaves, etc. behind the counter look excellent!"", ""Jane... I'm onto you. You don't post your prices. You ask for 20% tip when you pay... so you're hoping people order a ton of food not knowing the prices because really, who is going to sit there asking the price of each and every item... and then you hope we are fooled into tipping like it's a restaurant... hmm. ok. A bit sneaky are you, Jane? But your taste is good and the service is good, so.... Ugh, Fine. I like you enough. I'll be back."", ""Who knew you were here?! \xa0Stumbled out of the Imperial Day Spa after a relaxing acupressure session to this amazing smell of fresh baked goods and lines of eager customers. Who has an appetite after being walked on - yet onward I went. Walk inside and you are greeted by stacks of fresh baked breads and cases of treats from cookies to muffins to Nutella brioche to vegan veggie sandwiches. In Janes it's not about where you start just be sure to keep going down to the coffee bar. Be kind to your servers and leave a tip too. Enjoy!!"", ""One of my favorite bakeries in SF. If you don't come early enough they run out of everything and by early it's slim pickings at 11am.I got the black sesame kiwi coffee cake and it was so heavenly. It had the perfect amount of light sweetness and moisture lasting until the following day. \xa0I hate when coffee cakes are dry and you really need to pair it with coffee. The coffee cakes here seem to change with the season but they were both good both times I had it. The Vietnamese coffee twist bun was sweet and really tasted like a vietnamese coffee. The only issue I had with this was there were pieces of coffee beans in this pastry and I wasn't expecting it so it really caught me off guard. I could really do without that because you have soft delicious bread with beans inside of it. It's like having seeds in an orange. I can't seem to get that lattice cardamom lattice bun so don't hit the snooze button on that alarm. They have a parking lot but it's always full and even parking in the surrounding area is a little difficult. Totally worth the trek though. In case some of you were wondering Jane the bakery is different from Jane on Fillmore. Jane on Fillmore serves more food and is more of a sit down spot. The bakery has some seating but more of a grab and go type of spot."", ""There are about 3-4 Jane The Bakery locations in SF. It's an interesting bakery business and I think it's worth it. I was going to spend some time on this Saturday at Bob Mizer, but that was canceled. So I decided to have a lunchtime adventure at Jane The Bakery on Geary Blvd. I drove a car because they have a small parking lot, but I got lost finding this on Geary. Anyhow, when I arrived, I noticed a long, unbearable line, but I decided to stick with the line. I didn't know what I wanted and it was hard to decide. I decided on a cheesy flatbread and a fresh baguette($4). I decided on an espresso shot($3). I had the flatbread at the shop and also drank my espresso, which was a bit sour to taste. It was served in a nice black ceramic espresso shot cup. I really don't like when they serve espresso in cardboard cups. Espresso should always be served in a ceramic shot cup, and maybe with a saucer. PERFECTO! I have the baguette at home and offered it to my father. Then I drove home."", ""Meh, was not impressed so probably wouldn't return since there are so many other bakeries in the area. We ordered an avocado mash toast & mushroom toast. Neither really stood out to me. The avocado toast seemed like something you can make at home yourself and I wasn't a fan of the pickled jalapenos - made it kinda cheap like hotdog condiments. The mushroom toast wasn't bad, but it was soooo tiny. I was still starving afterwards. Total was $17. I also ordered a matcha latte, which they completely forgot about. When I checked up on it, they apologized and asked for my card again because they forgot to charge me for it and forgot to make it. It tasted very grainy and powdery! Maybe they were rushing when they made it for me? Another $5. After $21 spent here, we were still hungry & dissatisfied so we went to B Patisserie afterwards :)."", ""Delightful! I really love this place. The cheddar chive biscuit is delicious. Crusty exterior and light and fluffy center. The chocolate croissant is very good as well. The twice baked almond croissant is also very tasty and crispy. Get there early because usually there's a line and most defiantly they sell out of popular items. I also tried a mocha super tasty but it definitely woke me up (I am not a big coffee drinker)."", ""Huge bread lover here, with an extra love for croissants. And wow the pastries were very impressive. They nailed the classic croissant very well and had a lot of original interesting creations. Chocolate croissant --was our favorite! Chewy, flaky, with a fragile crust. The chocolate was good quality too. It was also huge but we engulfed it. Lattice bun --This was quite new and interesting! It's like a croissant brioche bun-- crioche bun? Yeah not as catchy as a cruffin but love the novelty of it. It was really puffed up and inflated, I mean the cross-section was quite impressive. The cardamom custard cream was bomb. It's like a vanilla custard with a mild cinnamon-y spice. Latte with oat milk was delicious too. Cute cup! :) The con was that-- there's barely seating and there's that one long tiny table facing the window, \xa0but your back will be very close to the line of people.

Built on ideas of hospitality, quality and balance, the menu slowly evolving to now include Pastries, Breakfast and Lunch served from 7:00am daily, it is immediately on entry that guests will notice an array of items unmatched by any other artisan bakeshop in The Bay Area, overhead menus adding to what can be found on racks or in cases with fresh items continuously being baked in back. Mostly locally-sourced and organic when possible, head baker Jorgen Carlsen and Pastry Chef Alexander Terrazas assisting Chef Michael at ""The Bakery"" while other locations each have their own team in place to cut down on transfers, it is well-advised that first-time visitors take time to peruse before placing an order, though a well-trained staff is happy to make recommendations for the indecisive. Truly a scratch kitchen, Chef Carlen\'s collection of Breads built from old starters and house-blended Flour forming the base for Toast and Sandwiches, it was while awaiting the former slathered in ground Almonds and Raspberry Puree that eight additional items were requested, a total just over $40 including Milk and Coffee not bad considering both the area and quality.Targeting both favorites and variety, the Gluten-free Toast noteworthy for a dense crumb created by no-less than nine Nuts and Grains, it was moving next to four Cookies that a range of textures and flavors were discovered, the ""Cookie For Breakfast"" unfortunately very dry save for bits of Fruit while Cap \'n Crunch, Chocolate Chip Toffee and one dubbed ""Crazy"" all sported crispy rims and soft centers plus the amount of sweetness expected from their ingredients.Onward to Viennoiserie, the Almond Croissant caked with Frangipane thankfully not compromised by too much of the cloying Paste inside, those seeking something laminated would be better off targeting Jane\'s Kouign Amann that ranks middle of the pack for Northern California, but for those seeking something truly memorable the decision comes down to a buttery Scone made with roasted Chestnuts versus Jane\'s ""Lattice Bun"" that eats like Yorkshire Pudding filled with Custard heavily perfumed by Cardamom.', ""Their pastries are above average and for that I give them 4 stars. Best time to go is early morning to early afternoon. That's when they'll still have a decent selection."", 'One day I was driving by this place on the way to Japantown and saw a long line in front.

The next time I was in the area I dropped by and got a nice parking spot in their lot and waited in a short line inside. I ordered a few different types of croissants, a sourdough loaf and a few other items. The croissants were a definite highlight especially the chocolate one! Buttery and flaky!

Onto the food, we ordered an avocado toast and chicken mango chutney sandwich. Everything tasted good and I really like their pickled jalapeños. I also like their pickles too!

Not too many spaces have seating for a mind numbing laptop experience, but this place looked good according to Yelp and we took the chance. All in all, pretty glad we found it; the ambience was a bit loud, and lively with all the people (a good thing for me). The staff were nice as well; I ordered an espresso and their breakfast sandwich. The espresso was clean and not bitter, and flavorful.

While I can surely understand why some have described the space as feeling cramped, I had no issue finding a spot at one of the counters on a rainy weekday morning.My go-to here is typically the matcha latte, which has such an incredible flavor. This time I went with just a regular ol' latte, though, and found it to be nearly just as delicious as the matcha lattes I am so accustomed to. The physical store also has oat milk, which fans of my reviews by now know I am a gigantic fan of. If you haven't had an oat milk latte, you haven't lived yet.Seating can be a bit cramped, as the building is one tiny little triangle on a crowded corner of Columbus. But the internet is great and there are plenty of outlets if you're staying for awhile. They have a kitchen and food, but I was only interested in beverage, so I don't know what they offer.

With tip my breakfast came out to about $14. SF is pricey even for a slice of bread with earth on it :)The avo toast was a Pinterest dream with slices of avocado, salt, pepper, and an egg.

I showed up right at 8 am, which is when they open on Sundays, and the two younger baristas inside seemed annoyed that they had to unlock the door for me. They were also blasting John Mayer and none of the chairs were set up yet, so maybe they got in late or something.

The menu is simple and I asked if the chai syrup was vegan and it was so I ordered a dirty chai with non cow milk in it. Making it vegan of course! The baristas were very nice and made the drinks face. My significant other ordered a macchiato and it had beautiful latte art. There's a restroom in the back and complimentary water station too!

I showed him how little I would be using (less than an inch), and he said no, sorry. Are you kidding me? I understand charging extra for non-dairy milks - for lattes, aux laits, etc. You're getting 8-16 oz. of it. But to charge the same amount for a small splash makes no sense. And then to actually be a stickler about it is even more of a turn-off. I'm newly in the neighborhood often, and needless to say, this place will not be my go-to.

Blue Bottle Coffee,"[""Smooth, cappuccino. One of my favorite places to get a cappuccino. Compared to sightglass, which I also enjoy, it's much smoother.

I live so close yet never visit as often as I'd like. Knowing that Blue Bottle Coffee is here might encourage me, though I have plenty of coffeeshops in Mission Bay where I live. I like that this Blue Bottle location is quite spacious. Once you order the front counter, you can choose one of many seats throughout the coffeeshop.Hopefully this doesn't get them in trouble, but I've brought my ESA husky into Blue Bottle and sat with him at the round table on the right-hand side of the place. Pretty sure they're dog-friendly because there's a water bowl right outside. Anyways, great spot to host groups or just catch up with a friend, which is what I did.Even if you don't hang out inside Blue Bottle, there's plenty of seating around South Park. Definitely sit outside if the weather is nice or go for a stroll around SOMA. Love the Blue Bottle brand and visiting all their locations.

The lady who helped me was very welcoming and explained the different blends they sold. It's always great knowing that your barista knows their stuff!I ordered the least expensive blend and got it with almond milk. The only issue with Blue Bottle that I have is that I feel like the price doesn't match the quantity nor the quality of what you get.

I\'m pretty sure there was a couple of grounds inside the pitcher that were not caught by the filter. I like coffee strong and that was NOT strong at all.

I wanted to try something different for once, but I defaulted back to a cold brew like I've always done anywhere else. I absolutely love the cold brew. BBC :-) is definitely on my list of top coffee shops. The staff are friendly, and the woman helping me ran through a few items on the menu before I made a decision. This location is very spacious, with tables to accommodate small and large groups. The perfect place to get some studying or work done. I love the open space, with glass all around to bring in a lot of light. There are a number of baked goods that will get your mouth watering. I was tempted to try one, but remembered that brunch was shortly after this stop.It's conveniently located near the park.

What I really appreciate about this location especially is that if ANYTHING goes wrong (they're out of the milk you wanted, they took too long, they gave you the wrong thing) they will do their best to fix the problem and then in addition will give you a card to redeem for a free coffee! I think this has happened 3 times so far and when it has happened \xa0the mistakes were all not a big deal to me. But it was still cool that they do this to make sure you're happy.

What can I say about Blue Bottle that I haven't already said in the five other reviews I've written about at their other locations? Not much except they are certainly consistent.

It's a very casual place that I can definitely see people lounging around in.The service was very prompt as well, with it only taking a few minutes for my mocha and almond croissant to be delivered.The mocha was good if you like sweet coffee drinks, but to be honest I prefer less sugar and a more intense chocolate flavor. An extra shot of espresso and the removal of half the sugar would have probably been more to my liking. It was good, just too much like dessert for me.The almond croissant was also good, but reheating it by microwaving it doesn't leave me with a very good impression. I'd prefer it was reheated with dry heat, like a toaster oven, rather than internally steamed, which is what microwaving does. It wasn't ruined, just kind of suboptimal to me.Overall, if i were in the neighborhood, I would come here versus Starbucks or Pete's.

Walked in (front door was still open) 5:04pm and got turned away because I was 4 minutes too late from their closing time. Looked up the Oakland location and see that they are open until 9pm. Yes, the drinks are awesome here but who can drink them if they close at 5 and or open at 7:30am which is very late for a coffee shop?! The schedule here makes no sense.

I noticed they serve that sugary confection here, but I tried to hold the reins tighter by ordering an 8-oz Cappuccino Italiano since it was a coolish afternoon even though I know it's a major faux pas to have cappuccino after 12 Noon (photo: bit.ly/2OEQT5O). I didn't get grief for my order, but I certainly got plenty of sugar as it was a most dessert-like drink for the middle of the afternoon.

Stumbled upon this place. It was cute and homey feeling. Upon entering, there wasn't really anyone to greet me. Took them a while to notice I was there. She was nice when she came up to the register though. The whole ordering process had a feeling of confusion floating between me and the cashier. Not a big deal though. I ordered the Horchata Frappe with a shot of espresso added. MmMMmm good. The order came out about three minutes after I ordered it. It was caked in a nice wallop of whipped cream on top. The first sip was bomb oh my goodness so good. It really was an amazing first sip! As time progressed however, I found myself getting overwhelmed by it. It took quite some effort to drink. Maybe ordering a medium for myself wasn't the best idea. I'd be more than elated to come back and order it again in a size small! I was also recommended to try the Coco Loco.

Only this time, I am happy and content with my vanilla latte. It's flavorful but wasn't as hot as I liked it to be. It was pretty much lukewarm.

Expensive pastries, avocado toast (yes, I ordered it), and fancy coffee. I ordered 4 pastries, 1 avocado toast, and 1 matcha and the total was $42. SHEESH. The selection on a Tuesday late morning was pretty minimal. There were about 3 types of croissants and a handful other pastries. The monkey bread is SPICY, fyi. I had no idea that there was cayenne all throughout until I gave it to my kid. Haha. The space is well... spacious. There's stadium-level seating that I've first seen at Boba Guys in San Ramon but you can work up there if you don't care about back support. Otherwise there are plenty of other tables, and those will get quickly filled up as lunch time nears.If we're comparing this place to Mr. Holmes or B. Patisserie, I think it's better for lunch but the aforementioned two are better for pure pastries."", ""This bakery is so GOOOOD! I've had the sandwich, the croissants (my fav), and today I got the hazelnut tarte. The 4 stars are because the past two times I've come ~1:30 or later and all the croissants are gone. The blood orange one, I'm salivating thinking about it and disappointed I couldn't get one of those stuffed croissants.The space is open and airy, you can bring your dogs. There's no wifi so you'll need a hot spot, but it's a great place to hang out, read, etc."", 'Founded by Julie Vandersmeech and Arnaud Goethals in 2015, the Howard Street location soon spawning an outpost at the Ferry Building and recently Noe Valley, it was shortly after 9:00am on a Tuesday that Vive La Tarte was found bustling, the sizable workspace filled by folks on their laptops or meeting over Coffee while a team of at least eight worked diligently throughout the immense kitchen.Belgian-inspired but infused with fun, artisan touches such as milling Flour on-site balanced by items such as the Instagram-friendly ""Tacro,"" it is at a distance that guests can see staff focused on tasks including rolling, folding and piping, the fact that each location offers something different each month virtually guaranteeing a following that will soon spread to Los Angeles.Clever enough to lure in both ""influencers"" and traditionalists, no small task in a city with outlandish real-estate and lots of competition, it is moving left to right that guests will find items both sweet and savory, a total of one dozen choices far from the shotgun approach seen elsewhere while additional items are made-to-order.Opting for a mix of traditional and modern, the five items selected tallying just under $30 after tax and tip, it was on bad footing that the experience commenced, the Almond Croissant frankly inedible thanks to what seemed like Frangipane with even more Sugar than usual while the follow-up thankfully fared far better thanks to thick Banana Pudding that somehow left most of the Viennoiserie still crunchy and awash with Ginger.Told not to miss the Monkey Bread by a trusted source, Vive La Tarte\'s choice to use individually laminated cubes bound by Butter yielding a texturally splendid specimen beneath granulated Sugar and bright with Turmeric, it was next Bombolini piped with Butter Cookies and Cream performed beautifully before finishing with an intense slice of Belgian Chocolate Cake flecked by Sea Salt.', ""What a nice find in the city! I actually tried coming here once a year ago and couldn't find seats so left. This time, we luckily grabbed some stools on their communal table where my friend and I were able to get some work done on our laptop (although fair warning, there's no free wifi here!) The space is huge, spacious, well-lit, and just makes for a great working and meeting place. They even offer a little patio area to bring your furry friends!While you're at a coffee shop, one would usually grab a coffee or latte. I'm not much of a drink person, so I was ecstatic when I saw the baked goods behind the glass. Let me tell you, the baked goods is where it's at! I ordered the San Francisco Cheesecake ($6.50) and boy was it amazing! It was made with such a fluffy custard that just hit the sweet spot for me. I couldn't help myself with each bite for its airy texture yet dense flavor. Oh my goodness, just get the cheesecake here and you'll understand."", ""Finally made it out to Vive La Tarte after hearing so much about the croissants and seeing so many pictures! Went with a friend and we arrived around 10:50 am, to find that all the specialty croissants were sold out except for the mocha croissants! Just means I have to come again then to try everything else. Food:- SF Cheesecake--$6.50My friend and I both declared that this was our favorite item out of all the baked goods we got. The cheesecake was so smooth and creamy, and a perfect balance between fluffy and rich and decadent. It was sweet yet still had a bit of a tang. My favorite part was the crust made of crumbled Speculoos cookies that were buttery and delicious. - Mocha Croissant--$5.00This croissant was humongous in size and packed with filling. When I cut into it, the croissant dough delicately flaked apart, and the cream inside oozed out. The flavorful, velvety, rich mocha filling inside was a delightful combination with the more airy, light whipped mocha cream on top. - Spinach and Goat Cheese Quiche--$6.50This quiche was soft and fluffy and not too dense. The goat cheese was also not overpowering and complimented the spinach well. Tips:- Come early if you want the specialty croissants. Before 10:00 am would probably be ideal. - Focaccia pizzas, SF cheesecake slices, and tarts are ready around 11 am, so if you want those items, don't come too early. - No WiFi but it's a big open space and probably a great place to study if you are able to snag one of the table seats."", ""The coconut cream croissant... ohmygawd. I'm going to have dreams about this one. The croissant is perfectly flaky and the filling is so light and delicious. And of course I've been trying to limit my croissants but now this?! Ruining me!!"", ""Another place I left until my very last day in the bay (my last 12 hours VS 4.5 years of living here LOL). Food 5/5: I got the very last black sesame orange croissant from their morning batch. Great choice! At first, it looked quite intimidating because of its size and the ample cream on top. It was super fluffy and had a unique flavor (what they are famous for). It was definitely on the pricier and calorie-heavier side but could be a yummy weekend treat!Ambiance 5/5: Pretty spacious and a lot of tables. Had I known earlier, vive la tarte would have been my to-go work spot. It was almost empty around 11 am on a Monday, too. I'm not quite sure if they have WiFi but, given the area, there is probably at least an xfinity hotspot."", ""Super hipster little cafe that is conviently walkable from Civic center Bart. Be prepared to wait in line to order, wait a long time for food to come to your table, and possibly crouch uncomfortably on the stadium like steps if one of their limited tables is not available.Their menu is creative and the pastry case is enticing. For me, I sampled the taramind croissant, chilli cauliflower quiche, and smashed avo toast. The pastry was light, buttery and the taramind very faint. I loved the quiche - the egg was so airy and the chilli flavor was subtle and not over powering. The smashed avo toast wasn't my favorite even though it was beautiful. The poached eggs was slightly overdone and I thought the smashed avocado needed a little more salt. What I found odd was the almost pickles tasting green tomatoes. The initial bite into that was pungent and unexpected."", ""The Pitch:Despite the two dollar sign worthy reviews and the slightly inconvenient location, Vive La Tarte is still a place that I encourage anyone to give a shot. Not only are there many delicious pastries, but there are also many scrumptious delights like their avocado toast or even their bacon egg breakfast! Did I mention fresh coffee? Yes, they heard that right! They have the best of both worlds! So I hope you take your time and enjoy my review!The Story:Well, this is my second time coming to this place, and honestly, the second time was as magical as the first! When you walk through the entrance, on the right side there's an area where people place their dogs and keep watch; whereas on the left side, there's numerous amounts of tables and seatings. From benches to regular chairs and even the large wooden stairs that can act as a seating for those who prefer that style. Honestly, I really love the ambiance (which I'll get to in a bit) and I love the spacious layout of the area. As you walk farther along the line, you'll see a large and long glass case, perpendicular from the seating and across from the coffee area ( which I'll get to in a moment as well), filled with numerous amounts of pastries. From creamy yet soft lemon meringue to an assortment of crossiants (my favorite!), Vive La Tarte really knows how to speak breakfast to the average customer! On the second time coming here, I ordered a chocolate crossiant ($4) and bought an avocado toast ($14). During the time I had to wait for the toast, I decided to sit down on the large stairs and tried my chocolate crossiant. I kid you not, this crossiant was like eating a piece of cloud, covered with a crunchy yet subtle crust. (If you don't believe me, I implore you to try it!) After I got the toast, waited 2 hours, and then finally got the opportunity to eat it, it was still pretty amazing! Although the egg yolk and avocado (which there was a prolific amount, almost to the point of disgustingly generous) made the toast very soggy, I still enjoyed every creamy bite I took. So don't mess around kids, this food isn't a joke!The Ambiance:I don't want to repeat what's there but to describe it, lots of wooden seating with lots of open lighting despite being indoors. If you think you've seen it all, you should try going to this place in the morning, where there's lots of sunlight: it's absolutely magical! I definitely do appreciate the coffee bar being in front of the food area simply because once you order the food, you can grab a nice cup of Joe! (Unless your name is Joe, then just grab yourself!) However, if you're not feeling a pastry, you don't need to go bother the pastry cashier! The Food:I really can't stress this enough but you HAVE to try it to believe it! The chocolate crossiant really is like eating a cloud dipped in batter then baked. And the chocolate is pretty rich, though I can't pinpoint what it is exactly, but I can say that it's on the lighter side of dark chocolate! The avocado toast is creamy and subtle, and it's not too overpowering! The avocado and eggs go really well together (I feel like that combo has been there since the creation of time!) The Review:Pros:- Great customer service (Always someone to clean up after you've done your part of the work)- Great pastries and drinks- Spacious place with lots of seating!- Definitely one of the best bakeries there are! (Yes, Holmes included!)Cons:- I'll think of one later when I can, but while you're bathing in your own saliva reading this review, let me just warn you that you have to clean after yourself like any normal human being in this fine establishment! (Haha, enjoy! c:0)Conclusion:I highly urge you to come to this heaven-sent bakery, where smiles are too prolific and the look of satisfaction is on every customer's face! (That is of course, unless you don't like pastries nor coffee. Then at that point, I recommend trying their toast and a sparkling water!) Please, please, please, if you've reached this point, it is not me begging you to go but rather your body craving this delicious bakery! As the French used to say... Vive La Tarte!

The matcha latte is very standard and would reorder again. I enjoyed trying the lemon tart and cheesecake, but would probably try something different the next time I come by.

It's a nice big opened space, so it's lovely to sit down and read and enjoy lunch. The croissants are so delicious, although a little heavy if that's not what you're looking for (if so, you MUST get the almond croissant, it's to die for). My go to item here is actually the falafel salad, which is really impressive. It has so much good flavor with the fresh falafel, yogurt sauce, beet, cucumber and light dressing on the lettuce. It's a little pricey, but can easily be split into 2 meals if needed! Recommend going in just to look at the beautiful food even if you're not eating and want a coffee or tea to go."", ""Found this place on yelp when I was looking for breakfast spots in San Fran. \xa0Vive did not disappoint. Has the feel of a modern, cafe. I really like the open layout which gives you views of the kitchen. I ordered the smashed avo toast which was great.

The place was pretty packed and the layout of the place is pretty interesting. You can either sit on the bleachers or the tables, there's a separate coffee bar, and it's an open kitchen. Seeing as there was no table seating, my friend and I opted for 2 pastries and some coffee. We ordered the earl grey crossaint and a slice of the SF Cheesecake, a latte, and a matcha latte.We ended up finding seats on the bleachers, and I found it quite difficult to eat. It's not that pleasant, but it's doable - I would imagine it would be a little difficult if I had ordered a Benedict. Anyways, both pastries were really good! The crossaint was perfectly flaky and the Cheesecake was extremely moist and the crust was bomb af - highly recommend both of these items! The drinks were good too! The matcha latte was really strong and you could really taste it. The latte was good, nothing special. Overall, I did really enjoy this place. I'm hoping next time I come there's table seating so I could try their other items, but their pastries are really good! I'd definitely try their other crossaints and desserts next time!"", ""As they say...good lord almighty! How many heavenly bakeries can one city support?

Ah how I love thee..."", ""Brought my parents to Vive La Tarte after touting this as one of the better croissants I've had in the city. I was a little disappointed at the lack of variety in croissants this time but I guess the layout changes for weekend service. The majority of the cases featured the flatbread pizzas or quiche. Still, we bought 3 of the 4 varieties of croissants available (black sesame, orange blossom, and plain butter) and a slice of the famed San Francisco cheesecake to share.We were piqued by the black sesame croissant but ultimately, it was our least favorite of the three. The cream/custard, aside from being a robust, dark gray, really did not have an iota of black sesame flavor which was disappointing. The orange blossom was pretty good though but ultimately, the traditional butter croissant was my favorite of the three this time. And between the butter croissant and the meyer lemon version I tried last time, I think I would pick the meyer lemon because in the realm of the best plain butter croissant in the city, I think Arsicault Bakery is still king.Where the croissants weren't all that this time, I did think the cheesecake was a winner. The crust was buttery, crisp, and had a slight cinnamon flavor. It honestly tasted like a biscoff cookie crust which was amazing! The cheesecake portion was fluffy and creamy, and not nearly as dense as a NY Cheesecake (which I honestly don't care too much for). The top could definitely use a little more refinement though - I thought our slice was a little too browned for a cheesecake.All in all, our spread cost us $20 with tip."", ""Came here for the first time on a Sunday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised with the layout of the space. There is an open kitchen with pastries and food items at one side and a coffee bar at the other. There is table seating in the middle and also bench/bleacher type seating where you can sit on a mat. Definitely a unique space. You can order items that are already made or order items that need to be made like Benedict's and Salads. Me and my friend ordered a slice of Cheesecake and an Earl Grey Croissant, with a Matcha Latte and a regular Latte. Both the cheesecake and croissant were really good. The cheesecake was rich and creamy with a nice crust, and the croissant had a nice earl grey cream inside. Would definitely get these again and maybe try a different flavor croissant. The lattes were good as well. It was pretty busy so we sat on the bench. Not my favorite way to eat but it was certainly different.

Usually when I\'m on 24th and Mission, it\'s because I\'m craving Mexican food. But on this very day, I had a craving for a hot drink. A hot drink? Yaaas Boo! I was cold and needed something to warm me up. I Yelped up a few cafes and many of them were already closed (it was around 8pm). Beloved popped up and it looked pretty solid. So, off I went to explore. Got there and my little heart kinda melted. It\'s just.... sooo stinkin\' CUTE! The vibes in that place were unreal. The baristas were madd chill. It\'s small but extremely cozy! There are a few couches to lounge on and a bar top where you can watch the baristas work their magic. I was intrigued! I sat at the bar and Damian gave me a menu to look at. But um... I kind of couldn\'t stop looking at him. Damian is eye candy, y\'all! They\'ve got some good looking baristas up in that joint! All the more reason to come back, right? But, I digress... So when I finally did look at the menu, the first thing that I noticed was that they use organic plant-based ingredients in all of their products (aka they\'re vegan friendly). I\'m a tea lover and they have a whole host of different teas on their menu! Score! They also make fresh juices, smoothies, salads and bowls. After reading the description of their golden milk, I decided to give it a try. It was fun to watch it being prepared. But after drinking it, I quickly came to the conclusion that it was just... okay. I did taste some of the spices but the drink as a whole was a little flat. Maybe it was because it was made with almond milk? To be honest, I\'m not the biggest fan of almond milk. However, the wonderful ambiance and great service is enough to make me come back. Their golden milk wasn\'t exactly my cup of tea (you see what I did there?), but that doesn\'t mean that it can\'t be somebody else\'s. I\'m planning on coming back to try their smoothies and fruit bowls the next time that I\'m in the area. Hopefully, I\'ll find something that I really like next time around.', ""Here I am, sitting at the communal table on a sunny afternoon, admiring the beautiful light reclaimed wood counter and thinking about what I want to order. This tiny space is like a portal to a fairy's kitchen in the woods. It's across the street from the 24th BART station and you could easily mistake it for being just like another cafe in the grungy Mission until you walk in. There are tall ivy plants dripping from the ceilings and a cute little gong, yes, a gong, that welcomes you. I've never rang it but maybe next time I will. This was a weekday and I came here by myself and a book because I wanted to look cool while eating solo. Who am I kidding, I need more than a book to look cool. I'm on a 10 days cleanse and this is one of the few places that can accommodate my rather wholesome albeit restricting diet. So I figure body detox + digital detox, makes it acceptable to show up for food in sweatpants, no makeup on, and my hair up in a lazy bun. Yay! Beloved Cafe is known for their wholesome raw vegan nourishments. I feel like this is the tiny version of Cafe Gratitude without the adorable food item names... I wonder if they are connected somehow... Anyway, I made up my mind and ordered the Green Detox juice (notice a trend here?) and the Quinoa bowl with roasted veggies with added avocados because I'm usually the person that ask for extra avocados anyway. You can tell a lot about a restaurant by the quality of their avocados. Here at Beloved Cafe, theirs was hella sexy, I gotta say. It was muscular, ripe, and smooches easily with the fork. I appreciate the freshness of their offerings and it is most evident in their juice. Everything seems made to order, sans desserts, so things take a little longer to arrive, but hey, it's the antithesis of fast foods.So as I'm spooning my quinoa bowl, savoring the medley flavors of roasted sweet potatoes, kale, sprouts, avocado, and grains, and simultaneously reading a chapter, I feel a tapping on my left shoulder from the person sitting next to me. Well, what a pleasant surprise, I ended up making a new friend that day, someone who had an insight about what I was reading about. My new friend and I decided to order a dessert to share, it was something new that I haven't tried before. The raw vegan cheesecake arrived to our communal table pretty in pink and playfully adorned with berries, it was a sweet ending to a naturally authentic experience. I love Beloved Cafe and I highly recommend you coming here with a friend or by yourself like I did, stay off your phone, and say hello to the person sitting next to you. You might end up sharing a dessert with them ;-)"", ""When my friends and I were planning on attending a performance at The Dance Brigade's Dance Mission Theater, we looked for the best reviewed restaurant within close proximity of the Theater and found that Beloved Cafe met both criteria perfectly.It was a slight bit hidden in the sea of buildings on 24th Street, however, once we walked in, I had a good feeling that this was going to be a positive experience.Beloved isn't very big as while there is bar-style seating, it was mostly taken which led us to have to sit in a slightly cramped couch corner area. However, it was very comfortable so I have no complaints about it. The staff there were extremely attentive, and my friends ordered a juice and a couple of salads, while I personally got the Buddha Berry Smoothie Bowl and the Raw Vegan Cheesecake which had a coffee-style flavor that day.My friends got their food and drinks within 15-20 minutes while unfortunately mine took about 45 minutes. However, was the wait worth it? Let me put it this way. I'm not a vegan whatsoever and this isn't my typical scene as I'm very happy with various ethnic meaty foods, burgers, sushi, etc. The Buddha Berry smoothie bowl was hearty and flavorful beyond belief - not to mention the size of the bowl I thought was more than fair at the price point. I usually inhale food and it took me a while to finish, so needless to say, I'd have this again in a heartbeat. The real star of the show? The Raw Vegan Cheesecake. I usually don't eat cheesecake because while I enjoyed it as a kid, it just wore down on me over the years. This one on the other hand - HOLY COW! The mouse-like consistency with the coffee flavor set it over the top and made it the best cheesecake I'd ever had in my life. Everyone was happy with what they had gotten and virtually finished their plates, and the staff even surprised us with a sample of a shortbread brownie-style pastry that was again unbelievable. I don't know how Beloved does it, but if this is what they call health food, I'm totally in! Thank you so much Beloved for the incredible experience and showing me just how delicious healthy vegan/vegetarian food can be. I can't say enough about this place and will definitely be back."", ""This place has it all. A lovely warm and comforting atmosphere, paired with delicious food and drinks. I've been here twice now. Most recently, I had their Red Velvet Smoothie Bowl and a homemade Chai. The bowl is packed with nutritious deliciousness and makes a decent sized breakfast (or snack!). The chocolate flavors in it are rich but the beet gives it a bit of earthy flavor that's unusual but absolutely delicious. The chai was perfectly spicy. Previously, I had their golden milk which did not disappoint! The people who work here are also great. They get busy since it's a small place, but they make all customers feel welcomed and valued."", ""I'm really surprised I haven't reviewed this place since I've been so many times and absolutely love it. This cafe has such a different vibe to any other. It's limited seating creates a really intimate atmosphere. The staff are super chill and give great recommendations on the menu. I'm obsessed with the lentil soup, hot chocolate, and cheesecakes. Oh, and the kale salad. I'm literally craving all of them now just thinking of them. I took my father in law here, someone that, by every measure, would not like a place like this (clean ingredients, super small, no meat or wine, etc.) and he actually loved it. He's a chatty guy and was super impressed with the staff's friendliness. I recommend this cafe to anyone--even those who think it might be a little too different for them. The food and drinks are reasons to visit, the staff and vibe are reasons to stay."", 'Love this place! Small hole in the wall, very welcoming, hippie vegan vibes. There is a bookshelve by the window alcove with very interesting reads. One book was about the Principles of Tao. We ordered the quinoa bowl, which can be made without onion and garlic! Very delicious. The smoothie bowl was refreshing for a Saturday brunch. The mushroom latte was definitely unique, to say the least. It had a subtle shitake flavor but was also sweet and warming.', ""A local friend recommended Beloved when I was in town last year, and when I came back this year, I knew it had to be my first stop when I came in this trip.It's such a beautiful and welcoming place, filled with custom wood and and welcoming staff and customers. There's a huge wall of tea and a simple menu with great, fresh, healthy options. Kate was serving me and absolutely made this my favorite spot in town. She was so welcoming and caring and attentive and knowledgeable, it was incredible. She knew so much about so many of the amazing tea options, and shared so many \xa0smart and fun facts and stories about the different kinds they have and cool properties and benefits. She was so sweet and offered samples along with it to me and the other guests, and just made the day of everyone in the cafe for the 3 hours I ended up staying. I ended up with a Quinoa Bowl and a pot of Long Jin which was perfectly brewed every time she filled up the pot with hot water, which was often. She also recommended the carrot cake muffin which capped off my day perfectly. I'm visiting the area and she recommended some other spots and events to check out which is so much appreciated. So far I've recommended the place to a bunch of locals and travelers and can't wait for more people to check out this place and enjoy the ambiance, foods, teas, and the most incredible service. A must stop if you're in town!"", 'I always walk past this cafe, and I finally had the chance to check it out - I enjoyed my first experience here!The Red Velvet smoothie bowl is absolutely delicious - filled with nutritious ingredients and a hint of cocoa. Generous portion size, had to pack some of it to go!The ambiance is absolutely wonderful. The greenery and spices on display create an enjoyable experience. I also had fun browsing the pages of one of the communal cookbooks on display. Very friendly and welcoming staff. Look forward to trying more on the menu in the future.', 'First time diner and I loved the dal, kale salad and juice. Staff was friendly. I only give 3 stars because the website says ""This is your escape from the city, your sanctuary..."" and I went on a night where I really needed healthy food in a peaceful space. Instead they were blasting pop tunes making it hard to have a conversation without yelling. On a normal night maybe Id be singing along with the staff but this night it was really distracting.', ""I love everything about this place from the organic delicious food, drinks, teas, the people that work here, the vibe, the decor. It is so inviting and cozy and comfortable. It's amazing to see 4 people work in a tiny space. Everything I tried has been amazing and I feel good knowing I'm putting such good food in my body that was thoughtfully put together by amazing people. I've tried the quinoa bowl which is my fav bc of the chipotle sauce, kale salad, lemon ginger quinoa cheese cake and blueberry cheesecake, mushroom latte(so good!!!), matcha latte, adaptogen ball, morning ritual tea(you can taste all these amazing earthy flavors that work so well that this just might be my favorite tea ever), plus they give alkaline water too!

You can get a nice pot of tea to share for under $10. I've heard the lentil soup (dal) is delicious with avocado and sprouts-- will need to try this. The reishi/mushroom latte is complex and taste; it kind of reminds me of a wholesome Chinese herbal soup that my mom concocts every now and then. The space is rather small but intimate, and anyone who comes here will appreciate the intricate furnishings and details. I'd suggest for groups of 3 or smaller. Also, if you're ordering its best to grab a menu from the front and make your way to the iPad toward the back so there's no muddled confusion of whether you're waiting for your food or seats."", 'Writing a review for my favorite cafe in the bay area.

The interior is beautiful with reclaimed wood and cups on the walls. Thee lights are really pretty in there. There's limited seating inside, but the smoothies are so delicious. I got an order of the island tropics smoothie to go and a 6 oz cup of chai. Total ran out be around $17 with tax, and I thought it was a lot when I was paying, but IT IS WORTH. EVERY. PENNY. The reason I say this is the following. 1) the service and the staff are great. They are super kind and knowledgeable, offering free samples of golden milk and tea to my and my 4 friends who came. I ordered a smoothie and they made extra so they let me keep the extra, which I drank on the spot with enough to share. The staff are just thoughtful in preparing your drinks. 2) the drinks were damn delicious. The green smoothie was just so flavorful and fresh and it just gave me some joy! I gave the smoothie to my dad who said it transported him to his childhood when he would drink fresh juices in india.

Arsicault Bakery,"['Arsicault was so good I forgot to take a photo and inhaled my croissant within 0.2 seconds of eating. Regret!!I came here around 1pm on a Saturday and encountered a 10min line, which is totally manageable when you smell all the good buttery deliciousness. I ordered four items: regular croissant, almond, chocolate + almond, and morning bun. In total, cost me about $18, which is standard for the items for I ordered and the insanely high quality. There is some seating inside, but I recommend eating your croissant while strolling through the Richmond!Everything except for the morning bun was excellent, but the real knockout is the chocolate and almond croissant. AMAZING. The one I received was fresh out of the oven, and biting into it was a magical experience. Incredibly soft and sweet without being cloying. The hype for this place is well deserved.', 'I swung by Arsicault Bakery in the early afternoon last week hoping to pick up some treats. My first visit to the bakery.Much to my surprise there was no line. I walked in and the pleasant counter staff was at the ready. \xa0Of the trays on the counter I spied the pastries on offer (four types of croissants, three types of scones, kouign-amanns, morning buns and chocolate cookies) and chose two croissants, an almond and a chocolate.The chocolate croissant ($4.25) was very pretty, the golden pastry very tempting. When I sat down at an table on the mezzanine and pulled the chocolate croissant out of the bag, the pastry bent and shards of pastry flakes went flying onto the table. My first bite made my eyes roll; all that butter and laminated layers of pastry enclosed a line of fine liquid chocolate. The chocolate blend (Valrhona 65% dark, 35% milk) was perfection.Just to satisfy my curiosity, I broke off a piece of the almond croissant ($5.75). From that bite, I thought to myself, ""Too sweet!"" The almond paste was really dense and sugary. Combined with the buttery pastry and powdered sugar on top, this croissant is incredibly decadent.Of the two, I really loved the chocolate croissant. It was delicious and, in my mind, ranks as one of the best chocolate croissants I\'ve had in recent years (and I\'ve eaten some really good ones in France as well as here in the US).The almond croissant was good, but should be shared or eaten with a glass of milk to cut the sweetness.Aside from the food, I thought the bakery had no decor to speak of. So don\'t come here expecting to find a chic French shop. There are just bare white walls.Seems to me the baked goods have all the love and focus of this bakery owner.As for the other pastries, I may or may not return to try them. It\'s the price that puts me off -- for me these would be a special occasion treat.And in the future if I have a hankering for a perfectly classic chocolate croissant that looks good, tastes wonderful and is made with top quality ingredients I\'ll be running back to Arsicault, San Francisco\'s truly French patisserie.', 'Long. Overdue. Used to live in the Inner Richmond so it would be weekend ritual to get coffee from the Richfield and walk on over to this amazing place. Their croissants are better than ones ive had in Paris!! The Choco Almond is the go-to, but even the original has the right amount of crunch and crisp. Best part: its so fresh you can watch them constantly bring new batches out from the kitchen!', ""The most amazing and delicious bakery in the history of bakeries. The line is usually out of the door to order and it is without a doubt the most delicious croissant that you'll forget you ever waited. I had the ham and cheese croissant which I thought was pretty standard and it was delicious, so soft, buttery, and it practically melts on your mouth and then the ham and cheese finds it's way into your tastebuds. But what was really delicious was the almond and chocolate croissant. So sweet, so much chocolate, and just wow. If you're in the area try it. If you're not, travel for it!"", 'I\'ll never get ""sic"" of Arsicault. The pastries are delicious. Actually the proper term used by the French is ""viennoiserie"", I believe. My absolute favorite is the almond croissant but I know of several family members who passionately believe the kougan aman is the king, queen, prince and princess of the Arsicault pastry kingdom. If the Arsicault Almond Croissant were to duel the Dominique Ansel\'s Cronut (a worthy competitor, mind you), I\'m pretty sure I know who would win. It would be a good fight, but Almond Croissant would emerge victorious! Of course this is purely hypothetical because the pastries are on opposite ends of the country. It\'s unrealistic, but still fun to imagine. Actually, on a recent family trip, I stayed at our comfy hotel at Union Square and sent my wife to bring back the goods. Lots of them!', ""If you go on a weekend make sure it's really early, that way you won't wait in the long line. This place has the best croissants I have ever had, The best part is that they're freshly baked. Most of the times that I have been here, I received them warm out off the oven. My favorite one is the ham and cheese croissant, it's flaky and soft, has the right amount of ham and cheese. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because of the cream and sugar placement, it's right in front of the register. When you buy a coffee you have to hurry up and add the cream and sugar so the next customer can pay."", ""I love having foodie friends who are on the same page as me with regards to loving good food. My friend introduced me to their bakery that is notoriously known for their French croissants...like actually French croissants. You don't know croissants until you've been here. I'm telling you. To paint you a picture, my friend and I were walking down the street to this bakery in freezing temperatures (in the low 40s, don't laugh at me) in the rain, only to be met with an extremely long line waiting for the same darn thing. It's that good. And there isn't even that much seating inside, so it's like not these people waiting in line are counting on some warmth and shelter after ordering their croissants!HAM AND CHEESE CROISSANT (5/5): So my friend is a vegetarian and I was initially planning to get something with no meat so we could share it, until she and her vegetarian husband both advised me to order this one because of all the raving reviews they've heard. To be honest...I don't usually even eat ham. I will rarely order a ham and cheese (except the one from Portos because it's bombtastic), but this was freaking amazing. The close-to-melting texture of the multi-layered croissant was the first thing I remembered when I took a bite, until I took another bite and was taken over by this overwhelming heavenly aura of cheese goblets playing the harp for me. Tldr? The ham and cheese croissant is a must.ALMOND CROISSANT (4/5): I absolutely love my almond croissants and the texture and quality of the croissant itself was fantastic, but I think I've had better almond croissants with regard to my personal liking. I think the almond filling was a bit much and too sugary to the point where we didn't really taste as much almond. I'm used to the filling not being as glistening and runny, as opposed to the hardened versions we come across. Still delicious though.CHOCOLATE CROISSANT (5/5): Fantastic. I'm actually not a huge fan of chocolate but I was impressed by this croissant. At this point, we were stuffed as we had shared the almond croissant, so this one ended up filling our stomachs to the brim but we were very, very happy with it.HOT CHOCOLATE (5/5): Totally hit the spot on this cold, rainy day. Very sweet and very rich...wouldn't usually recommended getting this drink with a chocolate croissant unless you're all about that life then by all means, who am I to stop you?! PARKINGLol. No."", ""Highly touted by Bon Appetite Magazine ever since opening, an early arrival at Arsicault Bakery remains recommended, the fact that such a place continues to thrive with no website or social media in the era of Instagram a testament to its old-school approach that remains appealing to Bay Area purists.Opened by Armando Lacayo in 2015, an Inner Richmond location separating the shop from competition and creating the sort of neighborhood feel likely to draw locals on foot, it is from residential streets that guests may access Arsicault beginning at 7:00am on weekdays, the interior filling fast while weekends frequently sell out of popular items shortly after opening at eight o'clock.Not the only Bakery in town by any stretch, but making a name for itself with old-world recipes and classic technique from the start, it is entering the space from street level that guests will find a small counter featuring less than a dozen choices, a faint smell of Yeast tickling the nares while staff take turns taking orders, bagging items and replenishing stock from the kitchen upstairs.Bustling but never hurried, a vastly different crowd from the sort found at Mr. Holmes at least partially responsible, it was in exchange for nearly $30 including tax and tip that five items were ported upstairs on separate plates, first bites of a still-warm Morning Bun falling short of Tartine's excellence, though still enjoyable, while the golden Scone offered plenty of Butter plus pockets of Fruit while eating more like a Biscuit than the typical British version.Moving next to Kouign Amann, flatter than the one at b.patisserie but structurally similar in regard to caramelization and layering, it was here that things took a dramatic turn for the worse as Arsicault's Almond Croissant was found far too sweet thanks to Powdered Sugar and gloppy Filling, though the Cookie to finish was better than most as a result of Dark Chocolate Discs as opposed to the usual Chips."", ""Ham and cheese or almond croissants are my favorite ones here!

I have to say, it's great. When I pass by this place on the weekends, I always see a line. I hate lines so I followed my friend's advice and arrived early, 7am on a weekday early.

I was really hungry so I ate the Ham and Cheese first. Since I was really hungry, I would say it was really delicious. It wasn't too filling. Then I ate the Almond Croissant. That one was filling and good. Then I ate the Plain Croissant. This is where it started going downhill for me because I was eating them too fast. Then I took a bite of the Kouign Amann and it was over for me. Lesson learned: Only eat two (2) croissants max in one sitting. If you really want to see how flavorful each of them are, I suggest eating one and only one different type every time you visit. For me, I can say for sure the Ham and Cheese was good.

If not, I like to heat it up a bit at home in the oven to get the crust a bit flakier and to melt the chocolate but make sure not to burn the delicate crust. The almond croissant is good too as well as the ham and cheese. The plain croissant is a pass for me when there are the other yummier options. It's a hit or miss on what they have available.

The owner is from France and used to own a patisserie there so he at least kinda knows what he's doing :P""]","['5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '3.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.0 star rating', '5.0 star rating', '4.5 star rating']"
