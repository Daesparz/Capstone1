Name,Description
Réveille Coffee Co.,"[""Love the vibe in this cozy little space! It's chic and modern without feeling obnoxious. Very communal and vibrant. I've been here many times and have never been disappointed by any of the coffees, teas, and matcha drinks. Don't think you can go wrong with any selection. I also appreciate the cute little cups and mugs when you order your drink to stay. I recently came for a quick breakfast pastry, but was pleasantly surprised by a pretty extensive breakfast menu. It was rough to choose btw all the fresh, healthy looking options, but I ended up going with the prosciutto and egg avo toast-- highly recommend!! It came out so fast and was such a perfect blend of flavors on top of a very generous layering of avo slices. I'm still dreaming about this one! Planning to come back very soon."", 'Folks, avoid this place unless you like being treated like you\'re transparent. I went for a quick cappuccino only since they\'re always out of food by early afternoon. The girl behind the counter walked over and stared at me...no smile, no greeting, just stared. I said hello...again nothing but a stare. I then said good afternoon and her response was, ""I said hello already"" and then again just stared. Not, ""what can I get you sir?"" or ""can I take your order?"". \xa0Then she proceeded to walk away.Whoever is the manager, seriously pay more than the likely minimum wage and get real help. There are at least six coffee places in a two block radius and only so many people willing to put up with idiots who don\'t realize that our patronage is what pays their wages.', ""Great coffee shop, very posh and upscale.At nearly $6 for a latte, it's EXPENSIVE; however, my latte was silky smooth and made to perfection with love by a passionate barista who really knew what they were doing.I would come back if I am in the area and in need of a kick, though it's unusual for me to justify $6 for a latte regularly."", ""I've been coming here for work-related meetings and every time they forget to print out the receipt for me. Today, when I noticed 2 minutes after the purchase, they told me they were unable to print it. I've never had an issue with reprinting a receipt at other establishments, I feel like they just didn't want to take the time...Other than that the drinks are good"", ""I didn't tried brunch before in another location, but it was too crowded. This Reveille is located in Castro street, and love them ambience here. Wish they have more seats. Coffee is great!"", ""It was rainy and I was looking for a place to retreat. I've passed Reveille before, so I decided to make my first stop to do some reading and studying.AMBIANCE is beautiful on the outside. The white chairs paired with thick unstained wood adds a nice vibe to the shop. I was a little underwhelmed when I got to the inside. The natural light was soon replaced with yellow as I made my way to the tight seating spaces. ORDERED regular coffee.DRINK was just fine. I wish I ordered food (the food I had at the Duboce Park location was fantastic), but the menu looks great.OVERALL a terrific three stars. Perhaps on a sunny day I will grab a seat outside!"", 'I wanted to like this place, however the ventilation is so poor in this Cafe and the smell of bleach permeated the coffee shop. Not only that, I saw cleaning supplies left carelessly outside the bathroom which I thought was very sloppy. Though the furniture is nice and the food is okay, this major detail of bleach was so bad. My coffee tasted of bleach because of the smell. By the end of my time drinking coffee here, my eyes were burning. I wish I were not exaggerating because I really wanted to like this place in the Castro, but I think the management needs to rethink the way they do hygiene at the coffee shop. I think that once they fix this problem, this coffee shop has lots of potential of being the ideal coffee shop in the Castro.', ""A spot that seemed to be dominated by people working, Reveille didn't have the same warmth that other cafes in SF have, but they still serve up a nice latte. Literally every table inside was occupied by one person on a computer or a phone, all in a line facing the counter. It felt like a satire.That being said, the area in the front seems better for gathering with a friend and feels a bit organic. My latte was solid, though there seemed to be something missing from my friend's dirty chai, maybe a little less chai than expected, as it was missing some of the earthy and spiciness we usually associate with dirty chais. Can't win them all, but still a fine choice."", 'Cool cafe, but no wifi on weekends (""owner turns it off""). Good outdoor and indoor seating options', 'Cute spot for coffee, and a bite. Love the place for a weekend read with a simmering cup of coffee.', 'It\'s a modern style coffee bar in the heart of the Castro district. I came here for breakfast one weekend morning and had the ""Shakshuka,"" a bold breakfast item that consisted of a poached egg that was swimming in chickpeas, some spicy tomato sauce, which I think had some jalapenos even, although my memory is a bit fuzzy. I also had one of their very smooth and strong cups of coffee.Let me just say that the Shakshuka and coffee did not go together like two peas in a pod. Next time, I\'d probably opt for the more traditional breakfast sandwich (which looks delicious from the pictures), but I did enjoy all the flavors of the Shakshuka; it was great to try it once, but it just felt weird eating something like that for breakfast with a hot cup of coffee. Guess I\'m just not used to it.A+ gold star for myself for a healthy choice though! I enjoyed the atmosphere here, especially in the morning with the electronic music playing; felt like I was in a fancy hotel lobby or something..ha.', ""I was here the first time today and my first impression is so great. My first impression might have been impacted by my 1 min visit to next door Starbucks though. The vibe is so great here, especially compared to next door Starbucks. They have a patio-like outdoor area as well which worked just great for me today. I enjoyed fresh air outside a bit, read some article and keeps moving to my next destination. Next time I'll spend more time here."", 'A nice compact coffee shop at Castro area. Quality of sandwich is great, coffee is average although. Good for short lunch/coffee break.', 'How did I get so lucky to have Réveille Coffee Co. as my neighborhood coffee shop? Réveille is the perfect mix of hipster, modern and chic and located in the heart of the Castro. They offer full breakfast and a wide variety of sweet and savory items, ranging from avocado toast (because duh!) to scones and almond croissants. Their coffee is top-notch and the baristas know damn well how to make a latte look like a piece of art.Did someone say, ""On Wednesday\'s we wear pink?"" because at Réveille, two charming baristas - Oscar and Dan - coordinate their outfits (which are always on fleek) and fill the space with energy and create a sense of community I\'m happy to be a part of. If you have the time, be sure to give them a visit and leave a tip for their excellent customer service.', 'Wow what a great place for an early breakfast! I always get avocado toasts. Quick and healthy! The coffee tastes great as well. I always recommend Reveille Coffe Co to my friends. Thank you guys!', 'The coffee was phenomenal. \xa0Though, I ordered to-go and they had me in a cup to stay. \xa0So, I stayed. \xa0I enjoyed. \xa0It was nice, busy.... but nice.The food looked amazing, but maybe well try that next time around. \xa0The neighborhood is lovely, so you can also grab a to go latte and enjoy a walk around. \xa0Again, coffee was delicious.', ""Always looking for a great coffee shop to walk into. They have a beautiful entrance and outside sitting area and the baristas are very helpful. The coffee is very well made and the to go cups are creatively made! Probably one of my favorite places to go for flat whites. The inside sitting area is a little tight, but you can stay and study if you don't mind the limited space. There is WiFi but only on weekdays. I'll definitely recommend this coffee shop if you don't want your Phil'z down the street or Starbucks next door. I will definitely be back to try the food; which looks amazing."", 'I have been a Réveille customer since they opened their doors. This morning I went in to have breakfast. As I place my order at the register I was informed that I was 4 minutes late for the breakfast menu... REALLY? If they are that anal about timing...TAKE THE DAMNED MENU OFF THE COUNTER SO YOUR CLIENTELE IS NOT DISAPPOINTED and SHOW SOME FLEXIBILITY. What ? Do the eggs disappear when the clock strikes 10:30? Never to return. Le Marais is a much friendlier place. today, a few weeks later, I thought I\'d give the place another shot. THE SERVICE STILL SUCKS. The guy, barista?, was so busy chatting and dancing around that it took him 15 minutes to prepare an americano. He then left it on the counter without announcing it and went over to the register to take care of someone else. Im really DONE NOW. (Should you need to know who he is ... he\'s the ""English major"" he announced that several times. His attitude sucks too.', 'Delicious . Great price and high quality. I love this place. Lovely staff. Recommended!!!!', ""I keep coming back & I keep mostly getting an overly hot, unbalanced espresso drink for my troubles. Every month, or so, I try again. I'm either an optimist or a dope. Probably the latter. Other than inconsistent espresso drinks, this cafe is fine, but the outside seating is what does it for me. Without that bit of light and air, one would be relegated to a boxy, dark space (that I think actually is a garage-conversion) that would make a claustrophobic feel anxious. The often groovy, but just a tad too loud music doesn't help. It's a small space where patrons often come to chat while they eat/drink & one should set the music level accordingly. The test is if you can't hear what the chick at the register not two feet from you is asking, then the tunes are too loud. *good location*fairly clean loo*hit or miss on the espresso drinks""]"
Native Twins Coffee,"[""This place to caters to all types of eaters. I've never seen so many toast options AND get to enjoy it in damn good gf sourdough. Their matcha is perfect. They even have a variety of other intriguing wellness lattes and unique coffee drinks. Without crossing over to the dark side of sugary gross lattes. The space is small yet comfortable. I'm always happy with every visit."", ""$6.50 for a turmeric matcha seems a bit steep but... I guess Lower Haight is coming up in the world. I had to put my headphones on because this place is teeny-tiny and the two gals working there were ranting back and forth about work drama. That's fine just not super professional. No biggie though. They have WiFi which is why I stopped in. The barstools are not very comfortable though - this is the kind of place that obviously wants their customers in and out."", ""It's not a far cry to say it's one of my favorite coffees in the city. Beans are great ( Temple ) & truth be told, I'm addicted to their butterscotch latte - 1/2 sweet, with almond milk, and every time - they deliver with a smile. All of them, which is a f'in rarity these days. The coffee isn't the only thing that's warm here :) I just moved closer to the neighborhood and couldn't be happier to start my mornings/kick start my afternoons with one of their bevs. Plus, it's a locally owned by amazing women, and I can't not support them. Take my money guys, I'll be back for another tomorrow ;)"", ""This place is fantastic - for coffee, toast, and friendly baristas/owners! It is owned and operated by a lovely set of twin ladies. This hits home for me as my twin and I have always dreamed of opening up our own coffee shop :). I ordered the dirty turmeric chai and it was delicious! A perfectly balanced drink. They happily accommodated my request of 2% milk - it's rare these days to find that as places only carry skim and whole milk.We also order the Pesto Tomato Toast and holy moly it was superb. The pesto was so good! And they use the perfect bread for avo toast - nicely grilled. As a millennial, I approve! They also have gluten free bread to accommodate those with dietary restriction.This cute cafe had a constant flow of folks coming in and out and for good reason! I highly recommend coming her for your joe and toast :). Best of luck to these ladies!"", 'Stopped in on our way out of San Fran because it was close to our AirBnb. The coffee was GREAT. I got a latte with an extra shot made with oat milk and it was super good. My roommate got the cold brew and enjoyed it also.Honestly, the only thing keeping this from a 5 star review was the avocado toast. I got it to-go so didn\'t even look at it until we got in the car. I probably just misread the description, but it was a couple slices of avocado on a piece of bread... I know, that\'s literally ""avocado toast."" It\'s just not the normal mashed plus some extra seasoning/veggies/whatever that I\'m used to. Like I said, coffee and everything else was great though!', ""Cute very friendly coffee shop on Divis. I got a cortado and it was very good. I've heard their food is also good. There is a small bench with a table on the sidewalk. Nice neighborhood spot. Very relaxed."", 'Just discovered this tiny place as I was walking down Divisadero. The pastry and the mocha were a bit too sweet for my taste but pretty good nonetheless', 'I come here a couple of times a week before my morning walk, and it is a perfect way to start my day. \xa0Very approachable team, superb coffee and espresso selection, although I always get the cold brew (sorry for taking so much of it!). \xa0They have all the milks (oat, cream, almond, etc. etc.) if needed. \xa0Also have pricey but DELICIOUS baked goods like donuts, bars, and natural pop-tarts etc.Not a ton of seating, have a good bar in the front and side to have a seat, but perfect community coffee shop for a cup to go.', ""I really loved Native Twins! I just stopped in for a cold brew in the morning, and I enjoyed the whole experience! The flavor of the coffee was incredible, the service was quick and friendly, and I loved the ambiance. I will definitely be back next time I'm in San Francisco!"", ""The lattes at Native Twins are absolute perfection. I used to get the espresso latte, but I stopped drinking coffee/espresso several months back and switched to the matcha latte (also have tried the turmeric and chai latte). Whatever the latte, it's always delicious and the perfect temperature (I find that a lot of coffee shops steam their latte milk way too hot, which is a big no no). The matcha latte, specifically, is smooth, earthy, and not overly sweetened. I've had a lot of matcha lattes from other coffee shops in various places and I always find myself judging them against Native Twins' because it's my gold standard that remains unparalleled. \xa0I could be biased because, beyond the drinks, the owners/baristas are wonderful: their service is warm and quick. The eponymous twins run a lovely coffee shop that epitomizes what a great local business is and makes me proud to live in the Nopa area."", ""Okay so there are several coffee places to choose from on Divisadero in Lower Haight, but this one is definitely my favorite. First, the coffee shop is super cute, the walls covered with record albums. Second, the coffee is really good. It is a bit pricier than I might normally spend on coffee but its definitely of quality. The only downside to the place is that it's not very big so I wouldn't plan on hanging out there. They did have some outside seating on the sidewalk however."", 'Love this spot. Pretty small but with a large personality. Very kind staff, good coffee, and yummy avocado toast. Got the garlic variation which was a bit intense recently but the traditional is extremely tasty.', 'One of my favorite coffee shops in the city! Their coffee is just perfect! Not weak, not too strong (burnt), just right! I also love their little muffins! Perfect place, great location, nice service! Totally recommended!!! :)', 'I love Native Twins. Their coffee is amazing, trust me, I am Italian. Their avocado toast is the best, trust me, I am a Millennial. Jokes aside, I really like this spot, their home made granola is excellent, and so are their pastries, from the same lab as Cibo in Sausalito.The Mill Valley twins are fun to chat to and they have an extensive record collection, plus it\'s really nice to be able to order ""the usual"", as there isn\'t the barista turnover you see in other coffee places in the area.I totally recommend it!', ""Great vibes here all around. Plenty of dogs and good food and snacks. Women owned business. Great ambiance great coffee free WiFi. I ordered pluot toast, turmeric green tea latte with oak milk. I discovered both pluot jam and oak milk on my visit there. They were kind enough to explain it to me. I can't wait to go again"", ""I love this place. I try to come as much as I can because this really is my favorite coffee shop. As a former barista/coffee snob, this place has everything you look for. Great beans, great people, and that intimate feel that makes a local coffee shop part of the neighborhood. You can't miss with their cold brew!"", ""Tried this spot a little while back and it was okay! The spot is easy to miss but once discovered, it's super cute and the staff is really friendly. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed by the coffee. I got the coconut & butter latte and my sister got the vanilla bean. The flavors just weren't there. When I tried my sister's, it tasted exactly like mine -- just a plain latte. Bummer because it's a $5 coffee. The morning bun was delicious though! Maybe it was an off day but I don't plan on returning to this location."", 'These delightful twins have added matcha, chai, yum pastries, and yum coffee plus great juju to the block. I highly recommend making this a regular spot. \xa0also a fab park-let to enjoy your treats outside!', ""I really love this place! Delicious lattes with so many different milk replacement options. Soy, heavy cream, almond milk, etc. This beats sight glass for sure! Tasty toast and pastries as well. It's a local business owned by 2 lovely twin sisters that are super nice. Support!"", ""Native Twins is a cozy little cafe nestled in the hills of the Haight district. Jen (who usually helms the coffees/teas) is a magician of a barista. I've never had cappucinos or pour over coffee quote like hers, and she shows her expertise and care without a doubt. Ashley made my toast today and I was beyond impressed. As a consumer, I've always enjoyed simple yet delicious foods, and these toasts theyvenconcocted are just that. I ended up not only getting the avocado toast, but the garlic butter and then a third on the sweeter side - cinnamon! Everything was amazing. The decor is very sleak, the ambience terrific, all with the steady backdrop of classic rock&roll. (Check out their posters on the wall!) Even though I live across the Bay in Berkeley I will for sure be back!""]"
Neighbor’s Corner,"[""This charming cafe served up much more than an amazing matcha latte and delectable piece of avocado burrata toast on the morning we visited. Warm and friendly smiles from the two sweetest gentlemen at the counter welcomed us. Packed almost to capacity, I thought for a second about taking my food to-go, but decided to enjoy it here instead. We were lucky to find the last couple of seats in this super cozy spot, and by the time our food was ready a line had formed out the door.The avocado and burrata toast was absolutely delicious! My eyes must have grown to the size of golf balls when I first laid them on it. Fresh is best and fresh it was, the handful of arugula with the creamy burrata on the very thick toast had me savoring every bite.There were so many other great looking and smelling brunch items, coffees and pastries I gazed at as they passed over the counter. Pricey? A bit, but the quality of the what's served isn't lacking. This was my first visit and I've already thought of an excuse to make my way over again!"", ""I hesitated to write this review because I don't want this place to get over-run but this place is seriously a gem. I also am so surprised that I never knew about this place and I used to live three blocks away--I guess it really flies under the radar! I am a huge fan of Andytown and their Snowy Plover so knowing that I didn't need to drive all the way to the Outer Sunset to get my caffeine fix was an amazing realization.The cafe is located in the residential area in Castro/Noe...you know the part where you have to climb the giant hill to get there and you wonder if your engine will actually make the crest at the top of the hill. What's nice about that is that there isn't as much foot traffic so it has a much quieter, chiller vibe. On a Saturday afternoon, there were actually some available tables--a crazy thought in San Francisco!They offer a variety of coffee options, including the famous Snowy Plover, and also some cool matcha options. The Snowy Plover mixes espresso, sparkling water, brown sugar syrup, and a generous dollop of salted homemade whipped cream. The result is perfectly balanced and refreshing coffee float. It's not overly sweetened like a lot of other coffee drinks so if you're a true coffee lover, don't worry it won't overpower the espresso itself. They also have several food options including Andytown's delicious scones (served with fennel honey whipped butter!) and also some more cafe-like options like avocado toast, etc. It also seems to double as a mini-market as there was a generous refrigerated section and also various goods being sold in a cute bookshelf (random items from Haribo gummy bears to handcrafted pottery--the theme was very unclear to me).My one qualm: wish they opened until 5 or 6 PM...although, they did recently extend their hours to 4 PM daily."", ""A wonderful local cafe. \xa0Coffee is great, service is friendly, and it is really nice to be a bit off of 24th Street. \xa0I'm always able to get a space to sit and they welcome people working there. \xa0Prices are high, but alas, we live in San Francisco."", ""The atmosphere is incredibly pleasant, and it's one of the cutest coffee shops I've ever been to. I would highly recommend coming here just for that.The coffee is also very good! Less fruity than most other places in the city (although the almond milk is a little watery)"", ""Mom and I stopped by for a quick morning pick-me-up, and were pleasantly surprised to find such a cute cafe in the residential area of Castro! \xa0It was also much larger than expected, with a decent amount of seating space (albeit at a communal table) and a bathroom for customers. In addition to the usual espresso drinks and teas, they also have an assortment of matcha specials. Since it was particularly hot the day we visited, mom and I both got iced drinks (even though we have a rule about not drinking anything iced before 12PM). I got the matcha with tonic - which was good until all the ice melted and it turned into soupy green gunk. My mom got the iced chai which she really enjoyed.They have a brunch menu that I didn't fully explore, as well as some packaged meals (including sushi) in their refrigerated display."", 'A standout corner coffee and bakery shop nestled in Noe Valley. I spent the weekend visiting the bff and we walked with her dog to this gem of a place. The Matcha Latte was perfect and the Currant Scone w/ fennel butter was so satisfying on that cold day. The lady who helped us was lovely and sweet. She even went outside to give water and give hugs and pets to our dog. The shop is a modern meets industrial design. Bathroom was clean and had cool decor. This shop also carries bottled drinks like kombucha, ice cream, and healthy food/snacks. Perfect place to catch up with friends over a nice cup of joe, do some work (I did see a girl with a whole laptop on a stand setup), or relax with a good book.', 'Steven made my day. I\'m in town for business the morning before I had gotten some items and suffered a bit of sticker shock at the $15 for three items I got (latte, croissant, and a cold brew) but... it\'s San Francisco. I\'ve been spoiled with LA prices. The coffee and croissant were Delish. Next day I had found out that my mother was in the ER and was despondent and had to go to my client. I went in for coffee and a croissant again. Steven asked me how I was... and while I love a social contract... I didn\'t have it in me. ""I\'m pretty shitty actually...."" was my response. He cracked a pun or two about my star-covered dress and he was very sweet. When the latte was done I gave him my card. He pushed it back gently and said ""it\'s on me... I hope things get better.""Thank you for seeing someone in pain and helping the little way you could for them. You made me a customer whenever I\'m back in SF. For sure. And the coffee and croissant? Totally delicious.', ""Finally got around to really trying out this local coffee shop and it was incredible. I've been for coffee a few times and it is incredible! They also carry oat milk which I appreciate a lot. I tried their avocado toast this weekend and was definitely impressed. The girl preparing them was meticulous and led to a perfectly portioned out, absolutely delicious toast. I added burrata on mine (11/10 would recommend) and my fiance got the hard-boiled egg on his. Both were fantastic. The side salad was also delicious.Perfect place for a quick brunch and amazing coffee."", 'Truly a place of comfort for the neighborhood. Great place to sit for a cup of coffee, or avocado toast. The staff cares and understands the micro-feel of our neighborhood here.', ""When the owner saw me wandering around the shop looking at all the foods and cute goods they sell, he introduced himself. We had a nice chat about how they just opened up and discussed his cool cork bench. We ended up buying a great sourdough loaf they carry from a local bakery. The corn muffin was also excellent. I believe they made the corn muffin in house. The macarons they carry were some of the most interesting flavors I've seen. They were delicious and were 6 for $15.They sell Andytown coffee.

I wish I had."", 'Love everything about this place! Very clean and modern aesthetic all around. Ample tables space and seating. Cozy and chill vibes. Warm and friendly staff (Steven is a sweetheart!) The macarons are incredible and the matcha latte is divine. Hopefully they can introduce more breakfast/brunch options soon! Looking forward to visiting this space more!', ""Neighbor's Corner is one of those cafes you always look for but never find. The Fata Morgana of cafes. Only this time it's real. An oasis in a quiet neighborhood - it seems it's always sunny when you walk in to Neighbor. Look outside the clean windows and you'll find palm trees and succulents, neighborhood people walking their dogs and even children (in SF!!). The clientele is great - at any given day you may find a young woman writing her thesis, the Y-Combinator founder working on her pitch for demo day, and a senior citizen finishing that 800 page novel. The staff. Oh the staff. All models of the perfect cafe personel - not too hipster, always friendly and approachable.

I really enjoy spicy chais where you can taste the ingredients and this one exceeded expectations! It's made with almond milk but it tastes creamy and is the perfect amount of sweet. I'm currently enjoying it as I'm writing this review haha.I can't believe I've been avoiding this place... it seemed a bit expensive, which being in Noe Valley, it definitely is, but I'm satisfied and will be back for sure. Especially because i'm just a ten second walk away! Also, I didn't expect them to have food, but they have a small selection of sushi, sandwiches, and even local ice cream! There are enough seats for studying or doing work and the lady behind the counter was really nice! I told her about my need for quarters and she was so quick to help. I even cleaned out all the quarters in the register but she said not to worry, that she had more in the back. She didn't need to be so friendly and she was! Thanks girl :)"", 'Really cute but overpriced and few options. I came in on a Sunday for breakfast and they were already out of food options by 10am.

I went there for breakfast several times recently and enjoyed a variety of beverages. Like Andytown, they have both the snowy plover and matcha plover, which are well-executed. The drip coffee comes with free refills, a pleasant surprise to a non-morning person. I tried the avocado toast, which comes with a huge slice of bread, as well as some deliciously spicy avocado. The egg was hardboiled, which is unusual but not bad. The scones with the seasoned butter are fantastic and definitely worth trying. To be honest, I was sad that I didn't have time to try all of the baked goods because they all looked amazing.There's also a refrigerator with various prepared food from recognisable SF restaurants, as well as some jams, coffee beans, etc. for sale.The service here deserves a special callout.

Home,"[""Another cafe that has been on my bookmark in like forever, and I finally had the time to check it out.We came Tuesday morning around 10am hoping that it would not be packed but it was.

This spot is definitely over hyped now. You will come if you have a habit of IGing your coffee or cafe foods. That being said, the one in the Richmond is better.Things to note:-Nice place to work only if you don't mind the noise level. Between the music, espresso machine, patrons, and cafe worker's friends it can get loud even with headphones so bring your noise cancellers.-The specialty coffees are super high in calories and sugar. They don't serve nonfat or unsweetened almond milk. -Dont get the cookie monster. It tastes like a butter stick fell into your already-bland milk laden coffee.-Nothing special to say about the drip coffee. The roasts are a little watery so it's a bit bland but its the healthiest thing on thr menu probably.-If youre going to IG, get the birthday cake for the rainbow latte. If you care, request for a specific picture or youll get something normal like a heart.-My biggest disappointment: It's freezing in here. Bring a jacket or layer up if you plan on working in here. They won't close the door due to ADA reasons--which I understand and am all for the accommodations but I have never seen a shop or restaurant have a door that absolutely must be kept wide open 'due to ADA'. You can't just close the door and leave it a little ajar instead of freezing your patrons? With 50 degree weather i don't know any place in SF that leaves their doors wide open.

It had a light lavender flavor that paired well and didn't overpower the flavor of the latte.

Trying to find a breakfast spot with no line or wait is difficult, especially on a weekend. HOME has fast friendly service. Their lines move pretty quick and since the food is simple, there is barely any wait. They have tables and bar style seating inside. Since many people like to come and hang out or do work on their laptops here, there are specific tables where it is strictly for eating/enjoying coffee AND tables that you can use your laptop at.......I like that concept. The menu is limited to coffee drinks, a few toasts, and pastries. Simple. Their drinks are tasty and most important.... pretty and instrgramable!', ""One of the reasons my friends and I stopped by here was because of the cool latte art. The menu is filled with various different lattes to choose from. I went for the hazelnut latte which was very good. They also have options if you're lactose intolerant. Did you know oat milk is a thing? Well I didn't till I came here and apparently when swapped with regular milk in lattes it's barely noticeable that it's not regular milk! The workers were super nice and very helpful about any questions I had. They also have types of toast if you want a little snack as well. I did not get the chance to try it but I definitely will the next time I am here.What's not to love about this cafe? From it's cute and simple decor you really can't go wrong. It's the perfect place to bring your laptop and get some work done while enjoying a latte. It is a bit small so it can fill up quickly so my suggestion is come a little early if you're planning on hanging out for a bit."", ""We tried out Home in the Outer Sunset, it was only 1 mile from the dumpling place but hubby didn't want to walk so we took Uber/Lyft - one of those car service.I ordered birthday cake latte $5.75 - it's very colorful artwork and has candy sprinkles on top. \xa0I liked it.Hubby got Cappuccino and it had a nice cappuccino art on it.Lots of folks in there. \xa0I can see it being very busy on weekends, glad we tried it on a weekday."", ""So disappointed. I trekked all the way out here to get a cool design on my latte only to receive a heart?! The cashier told me all the lattes came with the cool designs when I asked. I was furious when I picked it up from the counter and saw that heart. Also, they charge extra for milk substitutes-sorry I'm LACTOSE-INTOLERANT! Don't punish me by charging extra for it. They don't make their own syrups in house which also makes it not worth the high price tag. A place back home that I love makes their own syrups and their lattes are less than this. I had the coconut vanilla latte. It was good, but nothing special.I could've spent this $6.50 on dessert or better food. The positive is that Home is a conducive place to studying. They have a long line of tables and chairs set up and outlets. The first few tables have a no laptops sign, just a heads up."", ""Cute interior, can get very crowded and seating is difficult. This place is worth visiting if you're in the area and have never been.My lavender chai tasted watered down, I couldn't taste the lavender.

Their specialty lattes (birthday cake, red velvet, rose, lavender, etc) are priced higher than regular but think they\'re so much fun and actually really good.

We came at noon on a holiday and it was packed. Like packed to where we were unable to get a table, and ended up consuming our drinks and food while standing. Not a big deal because we just used the little counter area by the door. For drinks, we ordered the Cookie Monster Latte and the Birthday Cake Latte. Although they were cute, they didn't taste any better than a typical latte from most other coffee shops. For noms, we ordered the Bravo and the Truffle Pesto Toasts. The bravo was your typical avocado toast with some bacon and radish. Compared to other avo toasts you can get in the city, this one failed to impress due to the lack of seasoning (not even pepper?) The truffle pesto toast served on a fluffy thick slice of bread with cherry tomatoes was much better, super yummy! Service was meh. The kitchen accidentally made us the kimchi toast instead of the Bravo Toast. Normally, we would just eat an incorrect order to avoid being annoying, but since neither of us likes kimchi, we asked to get our toast corrected. At first we were told we could keep the wrong toast since they were just going to throw it out, and then I was called over and told they actually want it back...interesting. They did give us the correct toast pretty speedily though.

Seeing all the pictures on Yelp I had to go for the birthday cake latte (even though the cookie monster latte was a close second choice...next time!). The birthday cake latte doesn't actually taste like birthday cake and I believe has a vanilla and hazelnut base. It's not too sweet (granted I probably have a higher sweet tolerance) and is deliciously aromatic. Service can be a little slow since I'm sure the latte art takes awhile to create! You may also have to wait a bit for a table as the spot is pretty popular and can get crowded. Be prepared for lots of girls sitting nearby squealing over the drinks and getting pics for the 'gram =P.

Luckily I found a tight spot (in between 2 people) on the bar in front of the window. I ordered the Cookie Monster latte which was 'eh', nothing great. The cookies inside were a little stale, maybe from the heat of the coffee. And I ordered the toast with tomatoes, pesto, truffle, and mozzarella, adding a fried egg on top and it was pretty good! I got a few people asking me what I ordered because it looked so good. For the 2 items I paid around $16 which I found pretty overpriced but it's a SF cafe, what else could I expect?Knocking down 1 star because I wish they offered more outlets to charge your laptop, specifically at the bar.

Food:- Cookie Monster Latte--$5.50The cookie butter did not overpower the coffee and instead added a pleasant sweetness to it. The latte was milky and smooth, and the little bits of melted cookie butter remains at the bottom of the cup were sweet and addicting. Little cookies on top of the latte were still a little crunchy, and even better when dunked in the latte.Tips:- We arrived around 4 pm on a Friday and there were a couple of seats available.

Definitely get it if you want to do it for the gram. I've also tried their London Fog, Cookie Monster Latte, Jasmine Lavender Tea Latte, and Cold Brew. All are solid choices! My friend let me have a bite of one of their avocado toasts and it was delicious! What I love the most is their service!

I never see just a swamp of studiers camping out in there -- which can be annoying even for someone who does frequent cafes for that reason. My only complaint is that the toasts seem a bit too expensive (don't get me wrong, they are de-li-cious) and also the coffee here is bland/watery/weak. I grabbed both house-drip and pour over. I understand some people might get disappointed even at a good cup of pour over because they are mostly light/medium roasts, but this wasn't a flavorful light roast, it was more a bland coffee water.

The bread quality is excellent. A thick hefty piece with a hearty nutty texture and a bit of sourness from the rye. Nice tang from the cream cheese and a very earthy herby pesto. Generous amount of pepper and salt brings out all the favors. Really wish the pine nuts were toasted. Is it worth $7 though? Not really.

It was a pretty thin slice - probably because it's rye bread. I probably should have went with a different combo and I probably should not be spending $7 for a tiny piece of toast with cream cheese.We also got a few pastries from the display. They seemed kinda meh, kinda familiar. When I asked if they made it or if it was shipped in, I believe the cashier told me it was from Neighbor Bakehouse. Ah I see.

I literally saw someone wearing overalls AND a beanie, like one wasn't sufficient.I love that you can see them making the bread and the orders in the back. I went ham and got two toasts: pesto and almond butter. The pesto was the besto. Soooooo good.I also got some sort of fermented kambucha-wannabe drink, which was also pretty good!If I'm ever back in SF, I'll definitely consider stopping by for a quick snack!"", ""I eat pizza 4 out of 7 days, just a slice. Did I say I like pizza? I find it to be the perfect snack - carbs, proteins, vitamins.So whenever Arizmendi in the Mission has a day off (Tuesdays) or they have unnatural toppings (I am looking at you comice pears or potato or something ungodly that you simply do not put on pizza without giving an Italiano grandmother a mini heart attack), I head over to The Mill.This is a hipster place that plays hipster music and is frequented by hipsters who like hipster beer and hipster food at hipster prices. To be fair, the food, craft beer, coffee and bread (Josey Baker bread) are great.Every evening from 6-9 (except first Monday of every month) they serve you pizza by the slice. One seasonal veggie and another classic cheese slice. It's a pretty big slice for $3.50 (plus taxes) and you can tell it has high quality ingredients. The magic is in the dough, which is baked perfectly, light, airy, crisp and salty (think tiny chunks of salt that hit your palette as you bite the crust). I usually get it to go, and I reheat it at 450 until the cheese starts to boil a wee bit. And voila, it's ready to be gone in 60 seconds. If you are craving a slice, without breaking the bank or your daily calorie budget, this is the place to be in the evening. You can usually find a spot on weekday evenings, and get your slice within 3 minutes.The toppings can be from onion and mushroom to 4 cheese (quattro formaggi) to something ungodly such as pineapple and jalapeño (sounds better than it tastes). Try this pizza for the dough. Also it's not gooey or overflowing with oil. So you won't feel tres guilty. If you want to balance it out, they also have a salad (7 bucks I think) that can make you justify that delicious slice."", ""When I first moved to sf I would go to The Mill all the time for toast in the morning, but eventually I got tired of waiting in line. BUT for the past year \xa0 I have been getting a whole veggie pie to go and it is SOOO good! There were a couple of times last month that the dough seemed a little thin but still delish. My favorite so far have been the delicata squash with pesto and the brussels sprouts but sadly I only got to have each once, unlike many others that they rotate more often. I'm always so excited to try a new topping, I literally check the website a couple times a week. Regardless, The Mills pizza is one of my favorites in the city bc it is so fresh, unique and delicious."", ""I love the decor. The toasts aren't too bad either, but as I mentioned in my checkin. This place is a Fox News parody of San Francisco.You get overpriced plain bread toasted in everyday machines and some jam from rainbow grocery gets put on top later.Lattes and mochas were good, but I am growing weary of trendy cafes that all do the same thing."", ""I absolutely love this coffee shop. It's almost setup like Four Barrel Coffee on Valencia the way things are arranged. They brew Four Barrel as well. I like the atmosphere of this place; neighborhood charm.I came with friends and we had a great time drinking food coffee and having an amazing convo. The natural lighting is fantastic I should add! The Mill is definitely a great coffee shop to visit when in the city!"", ""The most SF place I have visited and if you're coming here, don't expect it to be cheap for what you're getting. \xa0The toasts are delicious and done very well, but brace yourself for the prices (they range from around $4-7 for a single slice). \xa0I came here late morning on a weekday and most of the tables were occupied with people doing work, which was crazy to me because there isn't any free wifi in the building. \xa0Still, there wasn't a line when I got there and I received my food within 5 minutes. \xa0If you're looking for suggestions, you can't go wrong with the seasonal fruit jam. \xa0I ordered it without even asking what fruit it was, and it turned out to be apricot, which I usually don't go for, but I'd definitely order it again. \xa0There was a pesto ricotta toast that sounded tasty, but it was on the more expensive side and from what I saw, it didn't look like it had much pesto at all, so I'm not sure I would go for that (I'm sure it's good, though).Could you make your own version of their toasts for much, much cheaper? Yes. \xa0Are you getting quality food and is it worth the price? \xa0Yes. \xa0I personally won't come here that often for food, but I still think it's really good and worth it every once in a while. \xa0Plus, I LOVE the fact that even though they're a toast place, they don't have avocado toast on their menu."", ""Best toast I've ever paid for! Haha for reals it was worth the long line. I got the cinnamon sugar and it was just the right sweetness. You could tell that it's freshly made. I rather enjoyed every bite. The only thing I was not a fan of was the coffee. It had a bitter after taste to it that just wasn't my cup of joe. I would definitely love to come back and try more toast, I'm kind of kicking myself for only buying one."", 'Okay, when I first heard about the toast concept, I was very hesitant. I kept thinking, ""Who would pay that much for toast?"" But after trying The Mill three times, I have not stopped thinking about the cinnamon toast. The bread is out of this world! Add a buttery cinnamon sugar blend on top, and you\'ve got what dreams are made of. Now, don\'t get me wrong, this is still just heated bread with stuff on top. BUT it\'s the best of its kind. Why wouldn\'t you want to try the best? The combination of all these simple flavors made me want to do a happy dance!The seasonal pastries are also fantastic. I tried a seasonal raspberry filled croissant coated in powdered sugar. Ugh, I\'m a sugar addict! This is perfect with coffee or tea.My only negative was the almond butter toast. Thought the almond butter was too thick and hard to eat. The bread was also too sour. I love almond everything. I drink almond milk, make homemade almond toast, and love all the almond-y things. California Almonds should sponsor me for the way I hype up almonds. The Mill\'s almond toast was not to my taste.All in all, the Mill is a must-try!']"

She ordered the avocado and egg toast with the Whopper Latte and I got the PBJ toast with the Crème Brulee Latte. OMG. It was honestly so cool seeing the barista whip out a machine and torch my drink. And it was even more fun trying to break the top of my drink. Her whopper latte was good and I really enjoyed the sweetness. Mind you, I was surprised they actually dropped a few whopper candies in the drink. It was pretty cool.The food was delicious. I'm a fiend for anything PBJ and the jam tasted so fresh. I was debating about also getting the avocado toast but they added red flakes.. and anything red reminds me of spicy. Your girl doesn't do spicy, as much as possible. But my dear friend said it was really good.

I know, a mid-age guy who came with another guy farted behind me when he left his table to get a cup of water. I knew it because he realized it stinks really bad and didn't go back to his table. He went outside for 5 min, came back inside, and went straight to the bathroom. (well, I feel bad for him and his health.)While he's outside, people realized something really stinks...Honestly I thought he accidentally pooped in his pants. It was that bad...People started to leave, and two workers went outside to check if the smell comes from outside. Then seems like it was from the inside. So a female employee sprayed air refresher at the entrance, and male employee opened the big window near the ceiling to get fresh air. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.

The sandwich was delicious, messy, and very filling. I kind of wish this was served on a plate rather than wrapped in foil since we ordered for here but it honestly wasn't too big of an issue.

Saturday afternoon close to Christmas and there are still young professional cats with their noise cancelling headphones going ham on their company laptops.

I guess the Salted Caramel and the Vanilla ones are a given in San Francisco at this point, but these guys also have a Creme Brûlée Latte, a Whopper Latte (candy, not the burger i assume), and some 'exclusive' ones like the Biscoff Cookie Latte.

For cafes, I like to prioritize it being a good work/study environment with eats/drinks being secondary.Foremost, good wifi and multiple outlets to either get some work done or watch videos. What I personally like about this place is the flow of people throughout the day; the cafe might have only you in it, but a few hours in, and there's a pleasant hum of people talking. They have both eats and drinks that include coffee and tea, or pastries and meals. Coffee and tea are good with prices reasonable. You'll occasionally hear people order the avocado toast, but never having tried it myself, it's next on my to-do list. Lastly, there is free street parking! Feels like a rare thing in San Francisco, but beware of street cleaning day which is the 1st and 3rd Monday of the month.

The space is quite large, with space to sit outside, in the front of the cafe, or in the back which provides a nice scene for working.ORDERED Matcha latte with oat milk ($4.75 + $.75 for oat milk = $5.50).DRINK is fantastic each time! This is one of the first spots I tried switching out regular milk with oat milk, and the balance is perfect (and doesn't overwhelm the matcha).OVERALL I give this spot a fit four stars. Definitely recommend coming in and giving their popular drinks a go as well."", ""Solid neighborhood hang; my go-to in this part of the Sunset. The drinks are all good, if not spectacular. I usually go for the Spainiard, a sweet latte made with condensed milk. It's a bit small and it can be hard to find a place to sit during peak hours. The vibe is on the quieter side, with most patrons hammering away on laptop keyboards or pensively hovering over books. Not a lot of power outlets. I will be back whenever I'm in the area and need to get work done, provided my battery has a full charge."", ""I'm not often in the Inner Sunset these days, but when I stop by, Snowbird Coffee is now one of my favorite places to visit. This is a charming coffee shop on 9th Avenue, and the wooden furniture and soft lighting makes this a perfect place if you are looking for a workspace or just a cafe to meet up with a friend to chat for a while. I've tried several of their espresso-based drinks and have not been disappointed. Their Americanos are great, but if you have a sweet tooth, they have a few drinks that include condensed milk as one of the ingredients. I've tried their café bombón, which takes a base of condensed milk and adds a double shot of espresso. The bitterness of the espresso balances the milk well, and it makes me nostalgic for those old days studying abroad in Spain (where I'd get a café biberon at the local cafes). Seating is limited, but I've never had a problem finding a table for myself. You should give this place a try!"", ""I have frequented Snowbird more than a handful of times and I am now writing a review because they have OATLY oat milk.

Upon walking in, I was greeted by the cashier who explained the menu to us and told us which drinks were most popular. I went with her recommendation of the Spaniard, a Spanish latte with condensed milk. I really enjoyed this drink and found that it had a good amount of sweetness - it was the perfect accompaniment to a little work session. The space is pretty small with single tables as well as a mini bar area so I wouldn't really recommend it for large groups unless you're getting your drinks to go but I will say that there's adequate room to get your work done if you're just planning on using your laptop! It is a bit dim in the back though so it's not the best work space in that sense. Overall my drink was tasty, the price was reasonable and competitive with others, and service was very friendly! I'll definitely be back again to try some of the other specialty drinks."", ""Snowbird is a chill, casual multi-roaster coffee spot that offers plenty of seating room and decent coffee and baked goods. I swing by on a rainy day and got the Spaniard, which is a Spanish latte meaning it has condensed milk that makes it a little sweeter than your average latte. Sure was tasty, but wish it we're a few degrees hotter than served. Pretty cool spot to hang out at as there's seats in the front and back."", 'This is a nice little coffee shop that we can walk to when we visit SF.

My fault for not paying close enough attention to the menu as the ounces are listed next to each drink. It was good and it came with some sparkling water, but I think it's overpriced.Street parking was plentiful. There are many 2-hour parking spots a block or two away, and metered spots right outside the shop."", ""I come here almost everyday for their special coffees. My favorite is the Spaniard, which is a Spanish latte with a splash of condense milk. The coffee is so smooth and silky with the condense milk. I usually don't add any sugar to my coffee. The condense milk was not overly sweet as I thought it would be. The baristas are always nice and sweet. I love this cute little coffee shop.""]"
Andytown Coffee Roasters,"[""Personally, I am a huge fan of coffee. Andytown offers a unique twist to their drinks. There's something about espresso and Pellegrino that's soooo right! They make their own whipped cream. My favorite is their snowy plover (they may have renamed it). It's basically espresso with Pellegrino topped off with their homemade whipped cream. make sure you mix it all up before drinking. Probably my favorite caffeinated drink ever. It's great that Andytown is so eco friendly. Their cups are compostable and they only use paper straws. Of course, you can take it to the next level and purchase one of their reusable metal straws for less than the price of a cup of coffee. The metal straw also comes with a little brush for cleaning the inside. If you like coffee, definitely checkout Andytown."", ""DON'T get the breakfast sandwich. Go down a couple blocks and closer to the ocean for more bang for your breakfast-sandwich-seeking buck. Hard, crunchy, overly-buttered bread (basically hard toast) with a sad piece of bacon, a slice of ham, and a runny egg. I asked for no cheese and mayo. Order it if you like the above."", ""You know how a name sounds familiar and you're not sure why because it gets trapped in your subconscious with the name of your third grade home room teacher and that colored powdered sugar they sold as candy in a straw.

The irony though was that I ordered the $2.25 Fresh Ginger Tea here (photo: bit.ly/2ViqC0q). I just had coffee over at the Beachside on Judah and didn't want to get hyper-caffeinated.It was cold that morning, and protrusions on my body were starting to ice over if you know what I mean. It was soothing with a slight spikiness. Not my protrusions, the tea. I also treated myself to a $2 Guittard Chocolate & Sea Salt Cookie just because I like to say 'Goooo-TARD' (photo: bit.ly/2EqGKHn). That was tasty.

I was searching through yelp for a good coffee spot in the area and came accross Andytown. I love coffee and anything with caffeine so I had to try their unique drink. I got here around 945am on a Saturday and there was line out the door already. I had my eye on the original snowy plover already, by reading reviews on it. The drink was definitely different....they make it with espresso, soda water, and a scoop of their home made cream. I loved it! It could be a little bit stonger in my opinion. I also got the blood orange scone which was tasty. They have a limited seating area inside and a few tables outside. I definitely would come back to try the matcha plover and other items if ever I am back in SFO.', ""There is something special about snowy plover which always draws me back to Andytown! It is so addicting!! I have tried different flavors and the original is my all time favorite :) There are three Andy locations in the Sunset and I discover the one on Lawton makes the most quality cream than the other two locations. Sometimes the other two locations on Taravel don't even fill me with a full cup. All of these places are relatively small so it's not the best place to hang out and chill with friends. \xa0There is really nothing to complain about their drinks and I love their latte so much as well"", ""Wow, talk about going in on a place for it's lack of space. All the negative reviews mainly mention that. While I do agree that this shop is rather cramped, I will not allow it to be to its detriment. Nope, not on my account. My advice, take a good shop for what it is.I had a memorable experience at Andytown and that was largely due in part to the friendliness of the staff. Their welcome was warm and surely came with smiles. What a good way to have woken up that morning. Aside from an excellent cup of drip I enjoyed, the breakfast sandwich that I accompanied it with made my morning start even better. Despite its shortcomings in size, I feel that is what made the experience. It means having to sit closely by complete strangers, elbows likely touching, or being on the lookout for the next open space if you haven't found a place yet. It has a charm to it, maybe an inconvenient one if that paradox is acceptable. It's good for a short stop, so take it at that. I was smitten with my visit to Andytown. So much so that I referred to it as my favorite coffee stop during my weekend in San Fran when talking to friends. Even brought myself a little bag of joy, in the form of their Ethiopian single origin beans."", ""Ok we came here because of all the positive reviews and unfortunately, I found out that I don't like certain kinds of coffee. And I admit that I'm willing to give this place another try by ordering something I know I'll like.Well, I never had a coffee drink with cream soda and soda water and through learning experience, this is not a drink for me. By all means, try it for yourself just to say you've had it."", ""I'm not a coffee drinker, but so many people recommended Andytown to me that I finally decided to give it a try. I was super thrilled to see that Andytown offers 2 non-coffee variations of their popular snowy plover drinks. I went with the matcha and loved it! I don't typically enjoy sparkling water, but this drink was refreshing and perfect for making the most of a rare sunny day while exploring the neighborhood. Also, the whipped cream is freakin' amazing. This drink gets a little messy--prepare to have a whipped cream mustache--but it's so worth it. Tiny space, so plan to take your drink to go."", ""My husband had this place bookmarked for his SF birthday trip this weekend and I'm so glad he did. \xa0Andytown's signature drink is the Snowy Plover: espresso cream soda, brown sugar syrup, and soda water, topped with their homemade whipped cream. \xa0I opted for the Matcha Plover- delicious!

Theres a few tables outside but no shade it\'ll either be too bright to sit out or too windy/cold. Anyways, I came with a group of 12 people and we literally took half the chairs in the outside seating area. My fiance got the iced coffee which was REALLY strong. I think I could\'ve added a full cup of water and it could still be strong.

Unfortunately, while it looked pretty, I thought it was disgusting!You're basically drinking an espresso soda, with sweetener in it, and some whip cream on top. The whole thing was disgusting, and tasted really off, especially the sweetener that comes with the espresso soda. It was just an unusual and unpleasant sensation.The best part of the drink though was the whipped cream, that was amazing and tasted really good. If I could do it over I'd just ask for an espresso shot with the whipped cream, and I would have loved it a lot.Even when mixing the whipped cream in, it only made the drink marginally better, and it wasn't enough to carry the otherwise crappy drink."", ""THIS PLACE IS MAGICAL.

I never thought that a whipped cream could leave such a major impact on my life, but I think about it to this day. The snowy plover is also amazing, definitely not for everyone but I enjoyed it a lot (ps - ask for extra whipped cream!).

The little bit of brown sugar syrup was just sweet enough to cut the bitterness of the espresso but not so much that I couldn't enjoy the strong aroma of the Andytown roast. The homemade whipped cream was also really, really good! I'm not even usually a fan of whipped cream, and typically order my drinks without it, but I loved the texture of theirs! I think I will be requesting it in all of my future drinks, even if it isn't included. :9I had the cheddar bacon scone for breakfast, which was quite tasty, but pricey for what it was.

Fifty / fifty managed to keep the aroma limited which I appreciate, but the latte still didn't really taste like much.

The place has a about 4 tables with seats and another long table by the window with about 5 stools. They offer free wifi for their customers if you chose to work on things there. They have a nice bathroom but you have to ask the barista for access to it. They offer a stamp card, for every 10 drinks you get 1 for free. If you order multiple drinks and use the stamp card the baristas are usually nice enough to take off the more expensive drink. They have pastries sometimes but it's not my favorite. Drinks on average are $4-5 here.Customer service is excellent here. There are usually 2-3 baristas working at a time and will get to you within a minute or two of you entering the shop. Very patient when you don't know what to order and can offer suggestions. They offer a variety of milk, whole milk, coconut, and almond milk. I believe it does cost extra for the coconut and almond milk.All their selections of teas and coffees are delicious although I tend to order their cappuccino. There have been one or two instances when my cappuccino had just a tad more milk but was delicious regardless. Teas/tea lattes: You can get their teas either iced or hot. Their matcha tea is usually pretty good although sometimes it can be a little bit on the milky side. Their Thai iced tea only comes iced so it's a bummer when you want it warm but usually pretty good. Their lavender earl gray is my personal favorite. You can add boba to any iced teas past noon.

But, i think it's close to early everyday, they should stay open at least more 2 hours day!"", ""Really high quality and tasty drinks! \xa0I ordered an iced lavender earl grey tea latte at half sweetness. \xa0It wasn't too sweet and the tea flavor really stood out. \xa0In a world where half of all cafes and boba places sell you sugar water, it was a relief finding this gem. \xa0Prices aren't too bad - they're about $4 on average. \xa0Service is good, baristas are friendly, and the drinks are high quality.My only complaints are the limited seating if you're coming here to get some work done, and the wifi is on the slower side of things. \xa0Other than that, I highly recommend a visit!"", ""I was nearby running errands and stopped by for a latte and a pastry. I think this is now my favorite little coffee shop. I ordered a cheese and chive scone with a matcha latte. The matcha flavor was just the right amount of bitterness and not too sweet. The scone was very cheesy and texturally pleasing. The coffee shop is small (about 15-20 seats inside) but it's a nice place to get work done or meet with a friend. Good coffee and great atmosphere will definitely have me coming back for more."", 'Simple but good Boba in the middle of Geary. Great pick for the SF Boba Meet up group. I am very picky with Boba and this place has true quality boba . I got the peach purée with tapioca. It was so yummy and gummy . This place space is small but packs a big punch with their drinks whether is matcha or lavender earl tea. I take mines to go unless you find a chair or table.', 'Got the matcha latte here. Having been to Japan, I still do enjoy the quality of the matcha here. The boba is tasty and sweet here as well!Would recommend this place :)', ""Stopped by here for a quick tea fix with a friend! We were hoping to study a little bit but it seems like all the tables were filled up and there were a few bar seats available, so I wouldn't recommend it if you're lookin to study somewhere with avid table space. Most people seemed like they were taking their drinks to go. The ambience was very simple, modern, and clean. I liked how there was a lot of light in the cafe! There's light music playing in the background- it's still very quiet! There's 2-3 baristas patrolling the espresso station & are very willing to help you out and a few pastries they have on display. I saw a few interesting drinks and settled on the honey coconut tea latte ($4.50) with almond milk (+$1.00) which I thought was kinda pricey for just almond milk! The drink was delicious, without being too sweet & just the right amount of coconut flavor without being too overpowering. I liked how the almond milk complimented the latte as well- I wonder what kind of tea they use! Overall a decent place to stop by for a quick drink that's close to USF campus! I'd come back again to try their espresso drinks and maybe swoop a seat to study if I could :D""]"
Sightglass Coffee,"['Long over due review... and this is not even for the brick and mortar location... this is for their pop-up location at the ferry building Tuesday and NOW Thursday! \xa0I love my \xa0lattes and sightglass has one of the best lattes in town which is why my Tuesdays and Thursday are so wonderful when I start off my morning with their lattes after I get off the ferry! Sam and crew are ALWAYS awesome in the mornings and so friendly! \xa0They are good peoples!', ""Goooood coffee, nice space. Only thing is that it's pretty hot inside and although there's a lot of space, there's no WiFi/barely any outlets to use. I also attended their first coffee tasting today and learned a lot about where they get their coffee beans and even got to Skype with the farmer in Colombia who harvests their beans. It was pretty cool. For $20, we got to learn a lot about the source of their beans and even got to try their pastries and the first tasting of the coffee! We also got a free bag of coffee beans as well and a cute pin that gave us a free cold brew next time we came.Overall so worth it if you love coffee/cafes like me."", 'TLDR: Go to Blue Bottle or Philz for better coffee, service, and pet-friendly staff. Most workers here treat their coffee better than their customers. Sightglass, never forget who\'s serving whom.I enjoy Sightglass coffee, but had an extremely disappointing experience yesterday when I used the Ritual app for the first time to pick up an order. I wasn\'t warned that your shop was not pet-friendly, so I walked my dog there and thought I could pop in to quickly grab my order. Upon seeing the no pets sign, I asked your barista if someone could grab my order upstairs since no pets are allowed inside. Instead of giving a direct answer, he told me to speak with your production team. A young woman in production said no dogs allowed, but she could grab my order. She asked for my name and what service I ordered through. When she found out it was for Ritual, she said I had to pick it up myself and told me to tie my dog outside. In SF, when anything left on the sidewalk is fair game, I wasn\'t about to risk losing my dog for coffee. So I asked her again if she could allow a one time courtesy since I wasn\'t notified about the no pet policy. She rudely said, ""No we\'re busy working"".1. When it comes to working, wouldn\'t you say that serving customers would be your team\'s highest priority? And if her task was too urgent/important, couldn\'t she have politely phrased her response? 2. I asked her to simply grab my order upstairs, but she treated me like I was a homeless person begging in some fancy establishment. No coffee, no matter how delicious, is worth risking my dog over or being treated so poorly. It\'s JUST COFFEE. I demand compensation and an apology for such a terrible experience. Your staff needs to be retrained, told to get over themselves and cool it with the snooty vibe. They are there to serve the people who help pay their salary. Don\'t forget who\'s serving whom.1 star because the coffee is good.', ""Hmm.. I love the shop layout here. When we arrived here, the line wasn't too long but can see the shop was pretty busy. But we still manage to get seat on 2nd floor. We ordered lattes, mocha and pastries. They gave you pastries right away to you. I hope they can warm it, it taste better. We waited aside to get call for coffee. The have latte art on our drink. We seated and enjoyed our breakfast. The mocha I ordered was pretty good as it smooth when drinking. The curry potatoes I ordered just so-so. But my hubby ordered himself mushroom pastry was really good. This is a definitely nice cafe place to check out."", ""Excellent quality coffee any coffee lover would appreciate! Definitely recommend their Vanilla cold brew ($4.50). For their cold brew, they give you the choice of whole milk or almond milk which I'm sure all the other lactose intolerant people also appreciate. Long lines come and go, but the service is always good and quick. They have other locations in SF, but this one is still my favorite because of the large and open space. They also roast their own beans at this site, so it's cool to see all their production machinery. They have 2 floors here. I love sitting on the 2nd floor where you can see an overview of the 1st floor and the baristas in action."", ""Sightglass has a convenient location in SoMa and an absolutely lovely space. I've previously gotten coffee here after work and even attempted to study for the MCAT a couple of years ago. I love their high ceilings and the abundance of light. It's great to meet up with some friends or read a book. However, there are no outlets, no WiFi, and no xfinity hotspots, so don't plan to get any work done here. Their drinks and food are exactly what you'd expect from an upscale hipster coffee shop in SF. High quality and slightly over-priced."", ""My last review is over 3 years old, so I wanted to come back here to update it. I live in Sacramento, but like to go to the Bay Area to hang out and am always looking for good coffee.This coffee shop is beautiful with high ceilings and large windows. I definitely enjoy the layout and the vibe of the interior of the coffee shop. You can tell that this is where they also have their roasting facility and corporate offices.I ordered a mocha for here which only comes in one size and appeared to be either 8 or 10 ozs. Since I haven't been in awhile, I confirmed that the chocolate used in their mocha is vegan. Almond milk is the only dairy milk alternative that they offer, so I had my mocha made with almond milk. My drink was good, but tasted a bit bitter and I suspect that it would have tasted more balanced had they added more chocolate. I still enjoyed it though even though I prefer a less bitter flavor. I would definitely come back to this location if I was in the area and looking for coffee."", ""I want to live in Sight Glass! I love the interior of this place!!! Literally my dream home. The open space is very inviting and I love how it looks when they open the huge window.I've been here 3x now, and I am hooked. My boyfriend is quite the coffee connoisseur, so he recommended I check it out since it's only a 2 minute walk from work. Service is good. I feel like a lot of people are unimpressed with the service because they're not chipper and grinning from ear to ear, but they work hard. And they let the quality of their work speak. Have you ever worked as a barista? I have. And it's not a very glamorous or fun job, so I respect the people at that place. I think they do a good job, and they've always been very courteous to me. Their pastries pair so well with their coffee. My drink choice is either an Americano or a plain latte. The espresso is so delicious, you don't need all that sweetener. I don't drink enough coffee to be a coffee snob, but I am very picky. Because of my boyfriend, I've been exposed to some good coffee, and I don't drink it if it isn't good. You can really taste the difference here. Also love their latte art!It's pretty expensive, so I'll only come if I want to treat myself. HA! yea right, take my money, please."", ""Thank you yelp for getting me to visit Sightglass coffee. I'm a sucker for good coffee and this was a match made in heaven. This place doesn't look like anything from the outside but then you come in and it's this two stories industrial room with the coffee bar in the middle. We had two cappuccinos and a macchiato. The coffee it self was really good but the latte art was just beautiful with no bubbles in the milk (that's how you know they're really good). We sat on the second floor so that we could get an overview of the room. Super cool. They also played really good music."", ""Upon first glance, the place looks good to work at - gentrification at its finest, with potentially amazing coffee, a huge space, and cool people watching. \xa0After spending $17 for 2 12 ounce ice teas and a pastry, I was still excited about working here. \xa0After finding a seat, I was getting ready to enjoy my time focused on the task at hand - except, they don't offer wi-fi. \xa0Epic fail. \xa0Further, no outlets to charge anything. \xa0$@?@ this place! \xa0True testament to the new wave. \xa0They'll be gone when the tech industry collapses,"", ""I'm not really a cool guy. I don't try to be. If I did, I would only succeed at making myself increasingly less cool, with the added embarrassment that comes about with effort. That said, it's with painful self awareness that I carry myself everyday about my business. Sadly, there is no way for the employees at Sightglass to know that, as they seemed determined to make it apparent that I wasn't cool enough to be there through their aloof manner of conducting their business. Oh, they're cool all right, this lot! And they make a mean espresso. Unfortunately, it ends up being a largely bitter experience.To review the coffee alone, it's comfortably a 4*+. Strong, smooth, perfect temperature on the latte. I wasn't thrilled that they don't have skim milk, but I'm over that. Sizes are small for a $5 latte, but it's SF, and as I mentioned previously, you're paying a bit to be reminded that you're only barely cool enough to order this coffee, and nowhere near cool enough to think that that entitles you to sticking around to enjoy this gigantic space.Service was... acceptable? It isn't outwardly rude, but it's definitely detached, and the whole place just feels stuffy and smug. It's the feeling of SoMa. We ride the highs, so we're forced to accept the lows along with them. Maybe this is balance?This joint is without WiFi, but as I mentioned before, the space is huge. If you're coming with a coworker or to catch up on a new book, you won't even notice. But if you're like me and your life is in your laptop, it's fairly inconvenient. Just something to be aware of.The lattes here really are exceptional. But the added cost is just too high for me to realistically come back."", ""Came here on a early Saturday afternoon and it was pretty poppin'! I love the shop itself. Really welcoming, plenty of places to sit, BUT a little dark - that could also just be Karl's fault though. This was my first Sightglass visit. I was hoping to get a pastry in addition to a drink but danngg! Pastries are a little out of budget here... I ordered a Vanilla Iced Cold brew which came out The Flash fast! I dumped my copious amounts of creamer into it and it was really good! Me and my friends hung out in the upstairs area which was a really cool floor! There's plenty of seating up there and a little more light than the downstairs area. As for their restrooms... y'all the soap smells SO GOOD! I'm not sure what it was specifically I think lavender but it smelled so good that I even looked around to see if they were selling it in store, they weren't :( but I believe it was a local soap company which is awesome!"", ""Very cute coffee shop I found while I was visiting SF on a business trip. I found via Yelp as I was staying at the hotel across the street. I decided to walk to it in the morning before my flight. The place was not very busy when I walked in and headed to the register, I proceeded to look at the menu and the person there asked if I had questions, I asked what is the popular drink, ended up ordering a latte and a corrisant. It was a big corrisant. The food portion was good and coffee was strong.The decor was industrial style and u kind waited randomly on the other side of where you order for your drink. I grabbed my drink and headed to find an empty spot. Mind you, I had a tiny ass latte all my crap and a corrisant in my hand, it was a struggle but found a spot.Side note: I opted to get an emailed receipt when I paid.I proceeded to get my order and it was pretty good.Fast forward couple hrs later, noticed I hadn't gotten a receipt, called the location was told I can leave a message which I did.Recieved an email, asked what day and time I purchased, did not hear anything back.Literally a month later I finally called back and was FINALLY emailed the receipt.... Horrible customer service, but thank you to the few who tried to help."", ""I always love coming here to escape the busy areas of San Francisco!I ordered their vanilla paste latte -- a new addition since I last visited. It was smooth with just a hint of vanilla. My only complaint would be that it was quite small compared to lattes I get at other coffee shops. I also ordered a Kouign-amann, which was beautifully flakey and just the right amount of sweet.The line at Sightglass moves quickly, so don't be deceived when the line is quite long. I did also visit on a rainy day, so all the seats were taken and people were slow to leave (understandably); usually this isn't an issue.Be warned -- there is no WiFi and no power outlets. This place is wonderful for coffee chats and reading, but if you're looking for a place to do work Sightglass might not be ideal for you."", 'We enjoyed this place so much that we made sure to visit every morning during our stay. Wow, first of all, the location and decor is AMAZING! Great industrial vibe- a really cool design the blends a coffee house and wooden loft. The coffee was fantastic as were their espresso options. Just delicious.', 'Scone was so good! It went perfectly with the coffee. Coffee was overpriced for the amount that was given to us but nonetheless, we still enjoyed our coffee experience! The place is very big and is two stories high! They also pack coffee beans on the side so you can see them putting the coffee beans into the bags and putting them straight on the racks to sell!', ""I definitely appreciate how spacious this place is! Came here with a friend and ordered their only tea on the menu (lol) which was very nice and light. Was more so drawn to this place due to its space! Sad that the place is kind of dark come nightfall, but it is what it is. I'd come back to work if I'm ever in the area again!"", ""Loved the atmosphere inside! Super spacious but wish they had more seating. Saw lots of people doing work on their laptops which is surprising because there's no WiFi. Great place to sit down and catch up with friends!Tried the mocha and it was stronger than most mochas I've had. It was subtly sweet which was nice. We waited about 10 minutes for our drinks."", 'Nice rustic place with a feel of a warehouse!Hip & trendy place to hangout for a quick cuppa!', ""This is one of my must-go destinations when in the Bay. So many varieties of coffee from all over the world. It usually takes at least 10 minutes to get a cup of their perfect dripped coffee and priced high but it's worth it.""]"
Weaver’s Coffee & Tea,"[""Yay!!! A coffee an espresso cafe that serves exactly what you order and prepared exactly the same every time you order it. And, the smoothest most delicious espresso ever.You want a cappuccino? Order a cappuccino! And that's what you get! Seriously. No - you don't have to say dry. Unless you want a dry cappuccino. And a Latte? Yep/ you guessed it- order a latte. There's a difference, but here you don't have to explain it to the barrista. My only complaint is that I am now buying two times the amount of espresso in a Market street stroll than I otherwise would. But, I take that back- I'm not complaining.Oh- and the staff are always so sweet it's refreshing."", ""Cute place to hang out in the Castro district! Coffee quality is good too. It seems to be on the quieter side so it's more of a place to read/work rather than catch up with friends.They don't have a bathroom in the actually cafe but the Fitness SF next door let's you use their bathrooms haha"", ""Weaver's Coffee & Tea has earned 5 stars all the way. I ordered their cold brew and it's everything you want from a nice cold brew. Good quality coffee, smooth finish, and just a fantastic flavor. Their star of the show though is their Matcha Latte. It was a good quality Matcha and cheaper than a lot of the places I've been to. The shop is cute and the employees were all very helpful. Definitely recommend stopping by."", ""I was in the Duboce/Church area of the Castro today. I decided to stop by this coffee shop at the Fitness SF gym. I wanted a bagel with egg. At first, it was bagel with cream cheese, and I changed my mind. It was $4.25. I already had a coffee from Peet's nearby. Then I had to use the restroom and they gave me a pass at the cafe. Fitness SF is a gay gym. haha"", ""One of my favorite coffee shops in the city. This is one of those chill spots you can grab a coffee, pull up a laptop, and crank out your work for the day. You might even catch some eye candy on their way to the gym next door ;).I love their matcha options. I've gotten their matcha protein (matcha, milk, and a scoop of protein powder) and matcha prepared americano style (hot water). They also have to-go drinks, snacks, and the drip coffee is solid.There's plenty of seating, and there's outlets for charging phones/laptops under the tables. A heads up that this place can get a little crowded, but table space usually opens up after some time. The WiFi is nice and strong.An added bonus? The Castro Farmer's Market happens right across the street each Wednesday."", 'Cool place to do your work. Calm, quiet in late afternoon when I came- my first time. Must be a good place to catch up with friends while people watching. Not noisy at all. Nice to discover new places like this. Surprised to see my bagel smudged with cream cheese as thick as the bagel- which is honestly fine.', ""Ritual is just across the street, but it felt so pretentious that we immediately ducked into Weaver's for our lattes and hot chocolates instead. On a rainy day, this spot can't be beat.I ordered a hot chocolate and asked about the non-dairy options. My barista was accommodating and very friendly, and said that while he couldn't guarantee the chocolate would be dairy-free, they offered soy, almond, and coconut milks as alternatives. Totally fine by me and my stomach! The hot chocolate was really good. Not only did it come out steaming hot, they even accommodated and made me a swirly foam peak instead of topping it with whipped cream. A small hot chocolate is $3.75, and dairy-free milks are an additional 50 cents.There is WiFi and plenty of seating for people who want to duck in and do some work. I love the interior -- it faces out toward Market, so you can do loads of people-watching.The bathroom situation is kinda hard to work, though. My companions had to get the bathroom pass, duck into the gym next door, head upstairs, and walk down a hallway of mirrors (...?) to get to the restroom. Since the two share the same building, I suppose that makes sense, but future patrons may need a map or voice memo instructions."", ""1. Lovely staffs with a cozy space and great environment. 2. Plenty of outlets and WiFi that's suitable for studying and working!"", ""Weaver's is my caffeination station!!!!! They brew bomb organic coffee, and always have a dope vibe.

Small simple local coffee on Market St.They also have brightly lit seating and some baked goods.', 'Pretty cool place to people-watch, with a nice modern vibe. The cafe has a bathroom agreement with the gym next door, which is slightly awkward (need to go through gym to second floor to find bathroom), but alright.I ordered a matcha green tea latte, which... unfortunately tasted like diluted water-y milk with a smattering of matcha flavor and artificial sweetener. Perhaps their other coffee drinks taste better.', ""Great coffee shop! It's located in the heart of Castro and has beautiful window seating for people watching and a nice view of the district. Right now, I'm sipping a Gibraltar by the window. It tastes great and perfectly blended with the milk. My barista did a great job!

Before the gym or after, make sure to stop right in!"", ""I have been a fan of Weaver's for years before I went to their actual coffee shop in SF. I would order it online.

The space was decent, not as expansive as other places in the hood but it was nice. The staff was super friendly and the prices were reasonable.I wound up getting a iced vanilla latte which wasn't really that great. It wasn't very flavorful and the coffee aspect wasn't that great either.I don't think I'll be back as there are way better places in the hood but maybe my experience was just a one off."", ""I came here with a friend. Cappuccino was okay. My friend said he had the worst latte he had in his life here so I guess it was really pretty bad. Restroom is awkwardly on the 2nd floor of the gym.. and they ask you to sign a waiver before proceeding upstairs. Seems v impractical. They did have wifi though!Pretty basic cafe, basically a great option for cafe to be next to the gym but out of all the cafes available in SF, I wouldn't specially make a trip out for this cafe."", ""Shockingly good.I got an iced hazelnut latte and it literally made me do a double take.

I had limited time left with in a friend, and we ran into get something for a late afternoon pick me up. The ambiance is modern and minimalist look. They specialize in organic coffees and teas. They offer a small selection of pastries, and few other items, but coffee is king. I've been to Weaver's a few times for their hot mocha. I'm a black drip coffee kind of girl, but I love, love, love their mocha. They use a dark chocolate and it isn't too sweet. It has a nice chocolatey flavor with the right amount of sweetness. On my second visit, I had time to chill, and enjoyed drinking it out of a white mug. My friends that I when with both really enjoy the chai tea.It's not necessarily cozy, but a fun spot to people watch. If you need to work on anything or use a charge, they have outlets underneath the little table bars. Staff is pretty helpful and friendly.They share the space to the adjacent suite which is Fitness SF. So be prepared to see some rock hard bods on your walk to the restrooms. They have a restroom upstairs, or guests are free to use the locker rooms on the ground level."", ""As we were trying to find a nice little tea shop, we found Weaver's Coffee and Tea. It's located conveniently on Market Street pretty much integrated with the Fitness SF workout area. The bathroom is actually the gym's locker room so be ready to smell the smells of the gym.They had your typical coffee selection as well as smoothies which makes sense for those working out, but we were here for tea. I liked that they had containers to smell the tea you're about to buy. It also looked like their brand which is awesome. I had the mango black tea. It had primary citrus notes and definitely smelled of mangoes. It hit the spot on this cold SF day, but when is it ever not cold!They also had baked goods delivered daily. The staff was quite friendly! There isn't much seating but it's great to people watch in there.""]"

He is very pushy about selling you extra stuff every time you come to the store. Once he talked me into buying one of his pastries. The pastry was clearly not fresh, though he, of course, claimed it was. He warmed it up in the microwave(which made it mushy).

Mmmmm yeaaaaaaaahhhhhh"".I switch sides of the road when I approach his coffee house because he\'s so pushy and sleazy.I also suspect that he\'s manipulating the Yelp review system in some way. The amount of positive reviews he\'s gotten, in such a short period of time, is disproportionate for a small, average-quality coffee store, in a residential neighborhood far away from the city center.

The way it was always supposed to be.This place is also special because it's run by a real person (Sam) who sees you as a fellow human and not just a customer. It brings you back to the coffee shops in Italy or Greece, where people hang out all day and actually talk to one another and live life in the moment. Sam is always in good spirits, making jokes, and is genuine. It's hard to come by this type of place nowadays, especially in San Francisco. I'll keep coming back. And for the record I've only written one other yelp review, so I really went out of my way to show the love."", ""Love this spot, the owner Sam is really awesome, he always has wisdom to share and makes exquisite Turkish coffee. His homemade baklava is the best I've ever had, super flaky and not too sweet.

Sam is passionate about his coffee and is determined to be #1 in the nation!', 'Best coffee in San Francisco ..Sam is so friendly and he actually helped me find good coffee . Must try .']"

It'd be helpful if they just had a menu of what was available for hand pour daily like most specialty roasters. I settled on the Ethiopia Sidama. I don't usually interact with the baristas, but my son was infatuated watching them make my coffee and he and the barista had a hilarious (and very loud) discussion about making coffee.

Flywheel Coffee Roasters,"[""Espresso here is STRONGGGGG.I *am* super sensitive to caffeine. Like super sensitive. But the two times I felt that caffeine really messed me up is when I... 1) downed my latte from Flywheel in one sitting (usually I don't ever finish an espresso drink) and I literally threw up at work and 2) when I finished a macchiato from Flywheel in one sitting and I was SWEATING in WholeFoods like I just ran a marathon and my hands were shaking while trying to find star anise in the spices section.The espresso drinks are Very Consistent and delicious. The espresso is flavorful and got a good amount of acidity/fruitiness and body. Their iced mocha is to die for (they use some kind of a darker chocolate so it's not TOO sweet and it doesn't taste fake).

It is a great, dark but open atmosphere and I always end up here because of the 'vibe'.

There were only 2 of them working but it was not busy enough to where they were slammed with orders, yet as we were trying to ask her questions to order, she kept going back and forth from the register and coffee maker and when asking about drinks, she was very blunt with no real explanation on the differences.

I figured if I had to wait to order that the barista who was less than a foot away from me and the ipad would say ""I\'ll be right with you"" or something along the lines of that. Since he did not say anything, I made an assumption that maybe I was suppose to order through the iPad since I have been to places that have an iPad ordering station.

My friend got matcha latte($4.50) and it was good but just average matcha latte to me. I've had better one elsewhere. I wish they have more seatings as they can get really crowded on weekends! Great place to chill and study on weekdays though.It's worth a visit, but I don't think I will come here regularly."", ""Best Cafe in Town!!! Thumbs up emoji x 100!!Usually 3 things i look for when i try to critique a cafe. Ambiance, Taste, and service. All really good! I got vanilla bean latte, which was pretty damn good, and a caramel/butterscotch glazed cake/bread! It's displayed in the front of the cashier. That cake was just amazing. It tasted even better with the vanilla bean latte. I like it very much when my drink and pastry just blends in well! The owner was very friendly and so was the barista. I think its usually just the owner and one worker working together. I've been here twice. It also seemed like most of the customers here are regulars. As a tourist, i highly recommend coming here for a grab in the morning and find a bird (scooter) and go inside the golden gate park! It's what i did and remains as the favorite part of my trip!"", ""When I got back from my semester abroad at the end of my junior year in college, I was an absolute nightmare for everyone around me. (Consider this Yelp review a belated apology.) One of my friends, who had just returned from her own stint abroad, was also pretty down in the dumps with reverse culture shock. We decided to vent to each other over a coffee break here, since we had heard Hollow was the epitome of minimalism with a more rustic IKEA vibe. I brought an IKEA catalog with me because I felt like we needed some European reading material to peruse.I didn't study abroad in Sweden. And my friend wasn't even abroad in Europe.Ah, the naiveté of youth! The vanilla bean latte was just warm and sweet enough to soothe my no-longer-abroad heart. My friend didn't have any complaints about her spiced matcha green tea latte. (She stayed on brand since she studied abroad in Japan.) The only other person there was on his laptop, trying to work in a coffee shop that didn't offer wifi, so in other words, he heard every word of our rant on the abominable American car culture.Come here if you want to catch up with friends, not if you want to be productive, because you'll probably get distracted by a bunch of entitled millennials.

I came here in the afternoon with some friends while visiting SF and needed a quick caffeine fix-up and ordered a Cafe au Lait with soymilk as per advice from my coffee-loving Italian friend. Before ordering, I was allowed to same each different brew and decide which one I wanted in my drink. I had never tasted a soymilk based drink so smooth or clean-tasting in my life. Normally soy makes a pretty obvious substitution for milk, but this time I really enjoyed the slightly nutty flavor that it gave off. The pastries also looked excellent; my friends ordered an almond croissant and a lemon muffin which I nibbled off of. Both were decent. Overall a great first coffee experience in SF; would easily come back to try different blends of coffee.', ""Stopped by Spike's this morning. The mocha was made perfectly per my specifications. Grabbed some croissants for my sons and they loved them! Nice atmosphere. Will be back for sure. Highly recommend!

Itadakimasu! Overstate much, Ed U.? Well, Jamie W. and I were back at Spike's after a long absence just because I was looking to have some hot liquid in my body after a brisk walk over the Swish Alps. It's still the same tiny place on 19th Street, but we take up less room so it didn't seem as claustrophobic on this visit. The service was pleasant enough but didn't seem that outstanding. Maybe I've gotten more crotchety over the years. I can cop to that. Get off my lawn!However, I did like the montage of dog photos which we stared at from the round table next to the front window (photo: bit.ly/2EwLqwY). This time, we took advantage of their robust tea selection (photo: bit.ly/2F9zMW6) and decided on a steeping $2.50 cup of Rooibos (photo: bit.ly/2C2YfNT). Jamie, never a fan of hot liquids, went with the $3 Ginger Peach Iced Tea. They offer all sorts of gummy candies, but we were good and stuck with our teas. We decided to replace our collective sweet tooth with subtle eavesdropping skills as we listened to an awkward blind date at the next table where the more interested guy kept laughing like a hyena at anything the other one said.

They really do have THE BEST LATTE just like they said! Place is tiny--this is the reason I'm only giving 4 stars. Right when you walk in, there are a few small tables and chairs to the left and to the right is a huge selection of coffee beans for purchase by the pound. There is a decent sized outside patio with tables and seating but on a beautiful sunny day like today, everything was taken up. All the way at the back of the shop is where you order. There is one cashier and one barista. Once you place your order, there's hardly any space to even stand to wait for your order without blocking the cream counter and trash cans. However, they work quickly to get you your drink so it's not too bad. You can have any hot drink iced for extra $0.50. This has got to be the best decaf iced latte I've had in the city of San Francisco. A lot of places can't get decaf right.

They have a few spots to sit inside and a few tables outside. Stay a while or take it to go. (They also have espresso, but the black coffee was pretty delicious)!

Whether you are people-watching from the outdoor patio seating or checking out the shelves of Spike's merchandise indoors, make sure you have a cup of fresh coffee in-hand. You can even purchase a pound or two of coffee beans to take home. (Trust me, this is a good idea.) There is not much seating, so coming here with large groups or to get work done is not ideal. However, Spike's is a great place for catching up with a friend or picking up coffee with a to-go cup that has the Spike's dog on it.

Saint Frank Coffee,"['I had the perfect latte at Saint Frank. It was the perfect temperature -- not too hot like coffee so often is. The milk was frothed just the right amount. Of course the latte art was beautiful, too. At Saint Frank the baristas measure everything. They weigh the espresso grounds before pulling a shot. Then they weigh the shot. And so on and so forth. Their dedication to precision really shows. The shop is spacious, well lit, geometric.', ""Now that the Third Wave is fully formed and we can stand up and ride our board for a minute, novelty has exhausted itself, and crowds have died down, it's fun to revisit this fine establishment and find that in the absence of so much chaos and hype, they offer a superior product and provide what's actually a very pleasant space in which to remain for a while. This time I went straight for a high-grade pour-over--I've never really seen the point of passing this option up unless you use a place this caliber for your daily cuppa--and it came out lovely, rich and flavorful with brightness on top, all the things high-end coffee is supposed to do.What I liked even more was that it's now possible to find a seat and linger for a while. The wifi policy of wifi only on weekdays, announced in the network name, seems like the right balance. Cell phones for essential information but no serious work; on a weekend everyone must make do with paper or actual human interaction. This would irk me if not announced loud and proud, which it is, and handled this way they get everyone on the same page. I still can't quite bring myself to release five stars when single cup prices often top $6, but I'll allow that here especially in the current configuration you get what you pay for, even if you do pay for what you get."", ""This review is about the wifi and the service not the coffee - the coffee is good. Every time I've been here, which has been 5+ times over the past year the wifi has never worked. Side note: they only offer wifi on weekdays. Today, the baristas looked at me like I had a third head when I said the wifi wasn't working and then tried to blame it on my computer when literally everyone else in the shop was having the same issue. There was a half hearted attempt to fix the issue followed by an equally lackluster apology. I'd understand if this was a one time occurrence, but their wifi issues seem recurrent. I know no one likes to do it, but can you please just call Comcast?"", 'I\'m not the biggest fan of coffee, but I went with my cousins because they\'re pretty into it. I\'d say it\'s where I imagine hipsters going on a Saturday morning to get their daily boost of energy. COFFEE: The coffee itself was alright. Both of the ones we tried had a certain tang of bitterness to them that I wasn\'t really expecting with the ""apple spiced"" component. I didn\'t really get any of that flavor at all to be honest... If anything, I could tell that the flavor was rich and deep. The coffee beans that they use for sure have a different quality than your average Starbucks coffee. Despite this, I\'ve had better cups of coffee for cheaper all around the Bay Area. SERVICE: It might not be the barista\'s fault, but some girl walked up after we had been waiting in line and asserted herself so she could get her cup first. I wish they had paid better attention to the order or had a more organized system of ordering, but it\'s alright.5/5 for that minimalist aesthetic and modern coffee shop vibe... 3/5 for the overall experience and taste.NOTE: This review is late, so the spiced apple latte was probably a part of their seasonal holiday menu.', ""I brought my cousin here for the coffee flight while we were being cheesy SF tourists. It definitely seemed like a local coffee spot for coffee fanatics and it quickly got packed. They have really quality coffee and a few menu items. None of the sugary varieties at Starbucks which I appreciated. They also have a number of baked goods. We ordered the flight of course which comes with a preset 4 cups. It's actually quite a bit of coffee for one person. I ordered the vanilla latte. I'm not really a coffee person but it was good. We also got the cheddar biscuit and banana bread. I love banana bread and theirs was soo delicious. Plus it's a huge slice. Perfect to share!"", ""Awesome awesome awesome place. The coffee is gorgeous!

We got a regular coffee(bold and tart) and I wanted a latte. Was recommended the spiced apple latte(seasonal), it sounded strange but they make the spiced apple sauce in house and there was no tart/sour taste to it, unlike the regular coffee. Reg coffee- 4stars, not too special, too sour for my liking but this wasn't my drink ;)Spiced apple latte-5 stars, surprisingly delicious. I was expecting a tart note from the apples, if there is one it's very faint. Quite delicious.

This place is expensive and seems to care more about being minimalist than being an actual coffee place. That could just me being bitter that they don't carry a sugar substitute though, I love my Splenda, even if it's bad for me. The coffee mugs they serve in are so tiny, I kept spilling it. They need to get bigger coffee mugs or serve less in it. Two people after me also spilled so I'm definitely not the only one.They let me use their homemade almond milk in my coffee for free which was nice of them.

While we waited, I took in the cute little coffee shop- seating downstairs with charging spots for those who like to get work done, and another seating area upstairs (I imagine sans technology support to allow for conversation). The space is bright and welcoming, as was the barista who took our order. Clear from those in line ahead of me, and per the recommendation, the almond macadamia milk latte was the way to go! We ordered two, watched them being made (very cool preparation space and view), paid and were our the door in just minutes! As for the lattes themselves- the almond macadamia nut milk definitely adds a creaminess to the latte. The beans, themselves, I imagine are quite strong as, even with the milk, I felt them to be slightly more acidic on my stomach. Regardless, the drinks were delicious!

Minimalism and great flow to the space. Their coffees and pastries are yummy :) their mocha has a great balance of bitterness and sweetness.', ""I still cannot stop gushing about Saint Frank Coffee, as I reminisce about my wondrous trip to San Francisco a little over a month ago. The first thing to be noticed is the layout and design of the shop. Which is comprised of high ceilings, a clean white square space, and a mezzanine to overlook that overlooks the shop. Coincidentally, it almost mirrors the interior of a Blue Bottle I've visited in Beverly Hills. Comparison notwithstanding, this space does a little more to harbor a more intimate coffee experience. The table and seat colors are invoking of a fall-like vibe. Brown tones meshing with the white interior blanketed by natural light from the large windows in the front, almost feels like a foggy morning and autumn colored leaves await you outside from the cozy inside. The coffee is excellent but displayed accolades on the bean shelf should be telling of that. Whichever direction you choose to go in (coffee, espresso, tea), you're bound to taste something delightful. \xa0Insert warm and friendly baristas, and this is all you could ever ask from a great coffee shop. They've hit all their marks in my book. Saint Frank, cheers to you."", ""Clean, high ceilings, bright and white. \xa0Good service and I tried the Cortado which is an equal mix of warm milk and expresso. \xa0They didn't have the spicy apple caramel flavor but at least I saved some calories! \xa0 We stayed there a couple hours, wifi was good, and got some work done. \xa0Polk street has been really updated with better bike accessibility and good for walking and this is one spot you should check out!"", ""I'm not sold on Saint Frank. I don't get what the hype is about. Sure the space is beautiful and wooden and all that hipster coffee shop decor crap but the coffee offerings are overpriced like a typical cup of SF Joe and the employees are no subject matter experts when it comes to the drinks they brew. C'mon folks, be better champions of the products you make!I was going to opt for their coveted almond macadamia nut latte until I saw the $6 price tag. If I remember correctly my roomie said this drink was so bomb and worth the $5.75 price tag, but looks like they raised it $0.25 since the last time she had it. Sneaky!Wasn't feelin the surge or the new pricing strategy so I opted for their other seasonal latte which had cardamom in it and tasted like a weird bitter chai. Before I had ordered, I asked the blonde barista what the drink tasted like and she had no clue. You'd think that for a coffee bar that offers a narrow selection of drink offerings that the people working there would be more expert on what the food and drinks actually taste like. Maybe they can host a taste test for their employees. This is coffee after all. The space itself is beautiful and there's a lot of light but when I went on a Friday afternoon during lunch time, there was no seating left because all the work from homers took up the entire space with their Macbooks. Again, I'm not sold on this place. It's a cute concept but poor execution."", ""A local coffee shop filled to the brim with hipster things. It's got that, 'I have it all but I'm trying not to flaunt it' look (wall decals, patrons / baristas with cool tattoos, minimalist/modern furnishing).The place is neat but I thought the coffee was just okay.A good place to swing on by for a cup of Joe if you're near Polk street."", 'Hip, clean, minimal space.

She said I'll get you the iced Americano for $3.50. It came in a glass. She offered me a special almond milk or something and then I needed some sugar or sweetener. The iced coffee was fine. I wanted it decaf as well. Otherwise I would have another sleepless night in SF. It was a treat. I started chatting with someone who ran a running race at Sonoma Lake. He was wearing Patagonia swag.

Philz Coffee,"[""This place is so so cute! Highly recommend if you're visiting San Francisco. I am a huge coffee lover!! When you walk in, you just smell fresh coffee and it's beautiful. I thought that their order of doing things was really unique, but super cool. You first order from a barista (you just approach one of them and order). Once it's made, they call your name out and you pick it up, taste it for approval so they can change or add something if you don't like it (which was a wild concept to me), and then you take your coffee and you pay for it. The baristas are so nice and helpful, and that was really what made the experience so great.I like medium roast coffee, and Philtered Soul was so incredible that I had to buy a bag to go back home with me. 10/10 great coffee!"", 'Wasted $10 on a bad barista. And we tipped too because we were confident in top quality service from all of our years with Philz. In all our years of tesoras and mint mojitos (no joke, we\'ve had these drinks dozens of times), this is the first Philz to ever make them wrong/poorly. At worst in other branches, they\'ll just be off by a little according to barista skill and nature. But this was just so off and disgusting. Both drinks were terribly watery. We always order iced. And this one was just mint water or mocha water with clumps of cream at the top. We always have a creamy top. This one was clumped up white bits floating st the top.We very understandingly and kindly brought it up to the barista quietly to avoid having them get in trouble especially in front of the line of customers. The barista had zero apology and blamed the ice. If Philz iced drinks would be watery as hell, I don\'t think they\'d make iced drinks as it would be 10 grades below their standard quality. The barista was more ""oh"" like we were idiots rather than ""oh I\'m so sorry I\'ll do better"". The barista made the drinks again and well, they were watery again. It was a nightmare as we tried to down our $10+ wasted dollars through sf.We purposely went to Philz that day instead of Starbucks because we wanted some high quality beverages and to indulge in something beyond basic Starbucks. Spending way over what we\'d spend at Starbucks and for something so unbearable is just the worst. We kept saying to ourselves ""we shoulda just stuck to basic today"".And to reiterate, my friend has been getting mint mojitos and instagramming them all the time for years. We even looked back at the old posts. This mint mojito looked like a disaster--like an earthquake hit sf and the water exploded into a cup and ingredients fell into the cup as well and sat for 5 days and then was served.I\'ve had an iced mocha tesora for years--it is my go-to drink. I know what it tastes like. This version wasn\'t even a variation or slight shift of quality (which can be expected between branches). It was so beyond off that someone that didn\'t know how to brew could have attempted it blindfolded and still made it better. Worst Philz experience ever. First time at this branch and first time having a drink poorly made and remade poorly.', ""My go to coffee place on the weekends when I want to do work.The coffee is obviously amazing.

If I lived in San Francisco, this would definitely be a study spot for me. I got a small Green tea which I requested with some honey. It tasted more like Mint tea than Green tea for some reason, but still was good and soothing for my throat."", ""I heard about the quality of Philz Coffee before I even stepped foot in San Francisco. I've traveled to this Philz a couple times, being the doe-eyed visitor to the Castro, to study and take in the Castro scene. The space seems to improve each time I visit, with changes to the menu and the interior of the space.I RECOMMEND checking out the menu ahead of time. The coffees vary a lot and have flavors I've rarely experienced with coffee. It can be a little overwhelming looking at the options, and can be a bit annoying if there is a line. I also recommend grabbing a pastry, which looked amazing when I ordered. They even serve Pepple's vegan doughnuts. Definitely going to become my to-go spot when I have a last-minute sweet tooth.

But for the last three times I've been here all the previous problems have vanished - which is why I came back. I've been greeted and invited to order. Payment was professional. (The product has always been fine). When I recently struggled with a lid, the barista helped me (the first time it happened several years ago the barista-applied lid spilled all over me). Yay. Good job Philz team. A special shout out regarding tea. It's VERY difficult to find straight chamomile tea brewed at coffeehouses and even some tea shops. The chains all have peach or citrus chamomile. Yuck. It's even chancy to get plain high quality black tea. But Philz has both."", ""Philz Coffee was on my list after one of my favorite food bloggers posted about a mint mojito iced coffee that she got there while visiting SF. There are several locations around the city and one really close to our Airbnb in the Castro. My boyfriend and I stopped in while wandering around the neighborhood. I ordered the mint mojito and he got an iced Mocha Tesora. Each had different ways to customize them including the level of sweetness and creaminess. We both ordered them as-is and sat down to people watch while our drinks were being made. The girl at the counter taking orders and making drinks was really nice and patient which made for a great first experience. The menu is a bit overwhelming as it's pretty large and there's a lot of info there to take in.We got our drinks fairly quickly and let me tell you\xa0-\xa0they were amazing. The mint mojito sounded so strange to me but it was creamy, minty, and refreshing without being overly sweet. It was super cooling and perfect for the warm afternoon. The Mocha Tesora was like the best hot chocolate you've ever had - it seriously tasted like a melted chocolate bar with a bit of coffee. These aren't serious coffee drinks but they are really fun for a special treat. They also offer (of course) plenty of coffee and tea options."", ""Pretty standard Philz spot. Nothing really against Philz coffee it just never has been my thing. I also can't tell if SF has too many people or not enough comfortable sit-down cafes.

The line was long but moved quickly.I love the way you order at Philz because you go right up to your own personal barista, explain to them what you would like, and then you walk over to the cashier and pay. Somehow this seems like the best possible way because you know your barista will understand what you want rather than a potential miscommunication with the person taking your order that might not also be making your coffee.The coffee shop was packed and there was nowhere to sit if I had wanted to sit down, but thankfully I was on the go! The flavor of the iced coffee was great! Strong and refreshing - you could really get the notes from the beans they use. They had yummy looking treats, toasts, etc. at the front as well if you are looking for something to eat."", 'This is probably the most fun Philz Coffee location. It is in Castro District, so parking is a bit of a challenge. The inside is super colorful and has a welcoming atmosphere. Every staff member I interacted with was extra friendly.

I came in this afternoon, 11/10/18, and was greeted so kindly by Barista, Taryn. When I walked up to the counter to give my order she patiently helped me find a tea that would suit my needs as I find the coffee to be a bit too strong for my liking. Taryn made me a delicious Iced Chai Tea! Upon leaving she was so kind to ask how I enjoyed the tea to which I was so pleased. my husband, of course, loved his Tesora (regular milk, regular sugar) Thank you to Philz and Taryn for a nice afternoon buzz.', 'As a coffee snob, I have to say that Philz is seriously life-changing. \xa0I love that they outline tasting notes for each type they offer, and that they brew each cup individually right in front of you. So heavenly. The staff is really sweet and they have you try your drink after they make it to make sure you like it. Wow. Wish we had Philz on the east coast!!', ""copped some sweet sweet, golden, mint mojitos here. i was impressed by peet's out here but philz takes the cake. unbelievable coffee. great caffeine experience, from the clean interior to the bustling and vibrant castro location. my next time in sf i will be back."", ""The coffee was constant with other branches in SF which is comforting, but I kinda getting sick of the attitude from the your majesty at the cashier just about every single times when I visit, and speaking of which, what's with all the families with kids and their huge camera doing in this place right in the heart of Castro the capital of LGBT \xa0neighbourhood?

Sightglass Coffee,"[""Probably one of the best coffee shop chains left in SF. It's a super hipster place, and all aspects of the coffee and location are well thought out. I got a mocha, w/ their fancy chocolate, and it was AMAZING. Super smooth, deep chocolate flavor, perfect amount of milk, and no sugar needed. It also came w/ a super cute latte art. I will say their water spout is a little broken and I got water everwhere, but that might be more of a me thing and less of a Sightglass thing. Overall, my favorite coffee shop in the city 10/10 need to go to one if you're around."", ""This place is below average I'd say. \xa0No music, no Wi Fi boring little place. \xa0Coffee staff dressed up like James Bond movie. \xa0Very San Francisco and very silly. \xa0 Space inside is good though with seating and window seats in the front. \xa0If they added some music and books and personality, I'd throw in another star or two. \xa0Pricing is about normal though this place is boring as Kansas."", ""Coffee: 2/5Snacks: 5/5 Atmosphere: 5/5If it's for their coffee alone, would not come here. I've had their pour overs, lattes, mochas (...) and I always go back for their treats and apple cider (which they don't make themselves). The beans they use here tend to be more acidic without a lot of the fragrance you get at other places. Their treats and store design though are on point."", ""Love the space, love their coffee, love their brand, and love their service. Sightglass is my favorite coffee shop in the city. The first time I visited, I was stoked that they used ice cream for Salt and Straw in their affogatos (this was before Salt and Straw had opened in SF). Their service is always great and fast, and the space is just so cool. They don't have WiFi but that's a great reason to disconnect and read a book or to catch up with a friend."", ""Sightglass is one of the best and most consistent coffee shops in SF.

I mean this place has it all; casual hipster/trendy vibe, polite bada** baristas, lighting on point, and a strong cup of coffee with impeccable latté art. Dude, if you have to complain about other minute things which don't actually matter when all you need is a cup of good coffee and conversation, it's ok to take your grouchy a** to another coffee place. Really.....I don't mind. : ) This Sightglass Coffee is located on Divisadero Street in the Lower Haight area of San Francisco. There's plenty of street parking around the area, both metered and free parking. If you drive closer to the residential areas, there's free parking. So what I notice that people complain about is how there's no Wifi here and also no outlets too. Wow, that is the one thing I really don't like about some coffee shops though. I go there to have some coffee with my friend and just try to chill for a hour out of the day. We enter and see that there's a bunch of customers sitting inside with their laptops and piles of books all over the tables. There's no telling how long they've been there and how long they will stay. Meanwhile we're just looking for a place to have a nice conversation and some coffee, not a place where people act like they're in a library. Hey I've been a student before. I understand the pain of finding a place to study/do homework that's not at home. It's fine, but give other customers a chance to sit. Another complaint is that you may have to share a table with other people you don't know. Really, unless they are contagious with some deadly disease, I really don't mind. Sometimes I actually meet the coolest people at a coffee shop! I don't work at or own the coffee shop, but to me, Sightglass is one of my favorite coffee places in the city and this is just another bada** location they opened so I definitely will be returning."", ""I was in the area with my friend and we decided to get some coffee before starting our day. We came across this cute coffee place and decided to try it out. The interior of the shop is super cute and it's a great place for getting work done, studying, or as a coffee date with someone. Anyways, we ended up ordering a vanilla iced cold brew w/almond milk and a latte with almond milk. Both of these were good, but I did feel like the almond milk with the latte was a little too nutty for my taste. I'll definitely come back if I'm in the area to try other things on their menu, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get a coffee from here."", ""Beautiful workspace with lots of large communal tables perfect for awkward side-by-side working and chatting with strangers. For whatever reason, this store seems to accumulate a lot of heat...probably a combination of location and lots of natural light. Pretty popular spot but I've never had trouble finding a seat.Coffee was good, but it was pretty expensive for a pretty small cup of cold brew ($4.50). Their cups did not seem regular size and I really needed every last drop of caffeine.Also, their bathroom is like the bathroom design of my dreams. I'm pretty sure they got custom wooden accents made (like there is a wooden cover built into the wall and also a wooden holder for toilet seat covers...because clearly that was necessary). I was also super digging the matte white wide subway tiles. And Aesop hand soap to top it off."", ""Just stopped in here for a quick cup of coffee and the place was super cool. Wish I had spent more time here with my laptop and a good book because it is totally the shop you want to come to for all the coffee place cozy vibes. Good people watching spot from the window and friendly staff. Oh and their coffee was excellent too! Like most places nowadays they had your non-dairy milks, always appreciated and some food options too that I didn't dabble in but definitely would next time. Tried tasting as many different coffees from various places in San Francisco as I could during my first visit and this place definitely had one of my favorite cups!"", ""Large café with tons of light and comfy seating.

Lots of people working but not primarily a working spot, which I'm appreciate. (Places where everyone is working is a bit depressing to me.)The service was quick, and the drinks were good.

It's not initially very obvious."", ""The cafe is spacious, open and brings in a lot of light. It has a great ambiances for a morning latte and quick pastry. It is also a fantastic spot to plug in for some long hours of studying.

It's easy to walk to if you're out and about on Divis, or to park near if you're not. (There is metered parking on Divis itself where spots are almost always available, and free 2-hour parking on the side streets nearby). Anyway, I'm a huge fan of cold brew and am always on the lookout for places that serve a great one. Sightglass is one of those places! I always get the vanilla cold brew with almond milk which is so, so good: the coffee is strong and not diluted or watery, but still nicely flavored by the natural tasting vanilla, and smooth to sip on without being overly sweet.They also have a decent selection of interesting sweet and savory pastries to accompany your beverage.

Please buy more!"", ""The ambiance of this coffee shop is awesome, super open bright and clean and a great space to get work done. The coffee is pretty strong and on the pricier end.

Video sketch on 3 of their shops. youtu.be/CKyLAk5jzuQThis location is on Divisadero. (Walk south a little bit from Nopa) Compared to shops in SOMA(large) or Mission(small), this space is medium size. It's not that hard to find seating. Even though there are only group tables, it's a good place to work as well. The details they put in lighting, color, furniture, tile, etc.. are very thoughtful alongside the coffee itself. You get a warm and special feeling when you are in their shops."", ""Another location of Sightglass has popped up on Divisadero and it is on par with the other amazing locations throughout the city. The iced vanilla cold brew, for which they are so famous, was noticeably smoother here than the ones I had tasted at the Mission and Soma shops. It really does taste like there is proper vanilla in that drink, rather than just being sweet and syrupy. The nitro cold brew but a bit more bitter than I would appreciate, but it was still a smooth drink overall and I'd recommend it over a hot cup of coffee on a warm day in San Francisco. The location lacks outlets and Wifi to discourage people from camping out with their laptops all day. It also got pretty warm inside, which wouldn't normally be an issues except it was a rare sunny day in SF.Overall, you'll be a fan of this location if you're a fan of the other Sightglass locations. Nothing too new or unique here, just in a new neighborhood.""]"

It takes a good 10 minutes or so to prepare, but it is done so with love and you will taste the great flavors of the coffee immediately :). If you don't like drinking your coffee black, add some of the cream/sugar that comes with it. For the smaller portion, the jabena holds about 4-5 of the small cinna cups. So, take your time here, gradually sipping the strong coffee, and bring a book or grab a seat by the window to people watch. It's the perfect time :).If you're not into coffee, then you should definitely try the shai (spiced Ethiopian chai) - prepared with strong notes of clove and cardamom!

They recently added more signage on the outside of the building which I hope will bring in more people because I didn't even realize it was a coffee shop until I finally went inside today.

I am lactose and I definitely don't like almond milk in my coffee (it completely changes the taste) and soy milk can be a little too thin and watery. Oat milk is so much thicker, so much tastier and it's better for the environment. I ordered a latte with oat milk, there are no real sizes here - the drinks on the board come out as a ~grande size unless you order a cortado (which is inherently smaller).

San Francisco has a world-class coffee scene. Truly. But in terms of coffeehouses where you can sit, relax for awhile, and/or work, San Francisco doesn\'t have many spots that allow you to spread out. Well, friends and Yelpers, I found a coffeeshop that does everything right: Wooden. Why do I love this place? I think listing my reasons are more efficient given my enthusiasm for this spot:1. Conveniently located off the 43 MUNI bus and N MUNI train. Very easy to get to if you\'re a public transit user like me. 2. Simple menu -- which, to me, tells me they\'re ""no fuss"" and only want to serve the essentials and do those really well. They also serve a variety of pastries (e.g. almond croissant, cookies). One of their special drinks though is ""The Thing."" (More on this marvelous concoction later.) 3. Nice baristas. Yvette, Steve, and Jetter (I believe I got those names right!) run the show. They\'re all friendly and make consistently delicious beverages. 4. Fantastic furniture+space+ambiance -- wooden chairs and tables, walls, floors... I mean, truly wood everywhere (hence the name?). The seats are comfortable and serve ""vintage chic"" vibes. Plus, there\'s enough seating for folks to read a book, commune with friends, or work (like I tend to do there). By the way, there aren\'t many wall outlets so I\'d suggest coming with fully-charged devices. There\'s a restroom in the back through the left door. Also, depending on who is working, they usually play some good indie music so ya know I\'ve got my Shazam ready every few songs. (Hi. I\'m James. I love indie pop and dream pop. kxthbye.)5. ""The Thing"" -- OK, this drink is tremendous. It\'s a cinnamon-based latte that, to me at least, reminds me of an iced latte spiked with the flavors of horchata. I don\'t know if that was intentional or not, but hey, I LOVE IT. They also make a fantastic iced chai (my next favorite at Wooden). So, there are my five reasons and praises for Wooden.

CoffeeShop,"[""Such a cute little place!! I've had CoffeeShop bookmarked for the longest time, and this past weekend, I got to stop by!!I got an iced latte with oat milk. They have Oatly!! So many places are out right now due to a shortage, but THEY HAD IT!!!!!!! The latte was nice and strong. Bold without being bitter. I thought it was really cute that the ice cubes were made of coffee and not water. The drink tasted even better when they had melted. Such a nice concept!! More often than not, I'm unable to finish my latte before the ice melts, and it just ends up tasting watered down...but not here!!I also got to try the Sherpa (aka Bulletproof). This is made using butter and coconut oil. I enjoy Bulletproof coffee, so I liked this, but the taste may not be for everyone. It's super rich and will leave you feeling fullBottom line: Kinda pricy but pretty much what you can expect for quality coffee in the area. I wanna come back and try the peanut butter honey cinnamon toast!! There was one man running this whole shabang. Genuinely impressed. It's a pretty small place, but there are a few tables outside. Grab an iced latte and make the short trek up the hill to Bernal Heights Park for an SF vibin' morning--hills for breakfast, gorgeous views, and a caffeine buZzZzZzz!!"", 'I\'ll admit I\'m a coffee snob (ha). \xa0But who doesn\'t love a ""hug from the inside?!"" \xa0When I heard this spot serves the infamous bullet proof coffee I had to try it and see what all the hype was about. \xa0I\'ve made it at home before but everything tastes better when someone else makes it for you, right? Order their Sherpa coffee (large if you drink as much as I do). \xa0They use Kerigold butter and coconut oil and throw it in a blender with their tasty coffee. \xa0Your first sip of the Sherpa gives you instant energy that\'ll last through out the day. Parking - street parking', ""$15.00 for two iced lattes that aren't even all that? No thank you. The only reason I didn't walk away from paying that was because the woman had already made it.

Just don't go and go to Philz or Tierria Mia"", ""This shop really pays attention to the little things - and they matter! A lot! First of all, this is the first place I've been to that actually foams the milk in its iced lattes! A definite plus for me.

Once you are inside, your are greeted with the aromas of cawfee, and baked goods. They have an excellent selection of baked goods, including, vegan, dairy-free, gluten-free options form donuts to date rolls to many other coffee accouterments.This is a pour-over coffee paradise. Be prepared for the owner to recommend the right coffee (he tunes into you), by specifying if you are light, dark or medium roast person. I picked dark, and he recommended an excellent crop from Brazil. My friend picked medium, and he recommended Ethiopia. She knows her coffee, and as a SF native, she felt this was right at the top.They also have almond, half and half and many types of milk choices, as well as the less adventurous lattes, mochas, teas, espressos. The owner said their secret sauce is customer service - and we experienced the warmth and genuine passion of a master barista, who hand picks the shop's blends."", 'Love this place.

All easy jokes aside, they're filling and seem all natural. They also have a version of egg in a muffin that's great."", ""This place is just fine. Nothing special at all.

It makes me wonder why they enjoy this place so much and what they order. I also don't like how they charge so much for an alternative milk and how the hazelnut price went up as well. When I first tried it, it was in the $5 dollar range but it is in the $6-$7 dollar range with subbing the milk. That's my only compliant. I haven't tried any other drink from them but there is a lot of hype for this hazelnut latte.

Ritual Coffee Roasters,"[""Visited last Sunday while I was checking out Mission district for the first time (it's semi-crazy how it is my first) but wanted to visit this place since I drink coffee like water. Disclaimer: I cannot really take strong coffee - even for americano, I always order as single shot or ask to put extra extra water to the drink so that it is more water downed and diluted. It is simply because of taste that I cannot take rather than caffeine.I ordered cold brew recommended by a staff and as a person who does not drink cold brew normally as I wrote above for my liking for coffee- I gotta say I really enjoyed it. It did not have sour taste which I commonly find in cold brew from starbucks and anywhere else but the ambience was hip and cute. Would definitely comeback when my second visit to Mission happens ;)"", ""This place is very cute spacious and comfy. \xa0Plenty of seating with two individual bathroom stalls. \xa0Back of the cafe has a large window with tropical plants making it appear a bit less city-busy. \xa0Coffee of course is great and their tea is delightfully served in a clay pot on a wooden tray. There's of course pastries, mostly if the sweet kinds, but a vegan sausage croissant roll as well. I was tempted, but I didn't dig in. For the healthier eaters, there's housemade granola with Chobani Greek yogurt. \xa0Outlets along one of the walls for those laptop users but expect to tether your own. \xa0Don't forget the coffee card, buy 10 get 1 free, Apple Pay and great service."", ""Nice ambiance and amount of seating. The light colored wood, high ceilings, and clean decor makes it trendy and calm. The place was kind of noisy, mostly because it's echoey, so if you're looking for a quiet place to work it may not be the place for you. It's a nice place for socializing and grabbing coffee with friends. My main complaint is the price. I got the Dandelion Mocha which was $6.25. It was a good mocha and I appreciate the local touch but I did feel a little guilty spending $6.25 on a drink, but I guess that's the cost of coffee in SF."", ""What I had: Iced chai with almond milkVisit date: February 18, 2019First time? Yes.This place gets crowded! On my visit there was a line - it goes by fairly quickly and my drink wait time was about 10 minutes. It was a Monday holiday so not sure if this is the normal scene. There's lots of seating, but again, there were lots of people, so it's one of those 'jump on the table as soon as people get up' situations.I had an iced chai 'for here.' They serve the for here orders in glass/ceramic ware. My drink was nice and creamy, just a touch sweet. It was perfectly refreshing. The atmosphere is on the louder side, but there were also a number of people doing work on laptops - the lighting is nice for it."", ""Came here with a couple of friends on a Sunday evening. Found parking easily on the street. The place has good ambience inside, decent seating and clean restroom. Husband got a cappuccino but it was served lukewarm. When we asked the barista to make it hot, he said cappuccino is supposed to be served warm, which I didn't think was right. Anyway he got us a new one which was better than before but still not hot. I didn't want to ask a second time so left it as is."", 'Had a great cappuccino here on my first stop of delicious coffee spots in SF. Cute space with friendly staff. The line was out the front door but moved quickly.', ""I typically love Ritual, but there's a couple things that knock this down to a 4-star establishment instead of a 5-star. First off, I do appreciate how clean and simply decorated/open this coffee shop is. It feels airy and not stuffy/cramped like a lot of coffee shops do. The people behind the register are typically incredibly friendly (s/o to Kendall). I came this morning around 8:30am and they were out of chocolate for the dandelion chocolate mocha (which is essentially the only reason I come here). They also have very limited seating (it's usually taken) and no WiFi. Parking can be pretty tough, and the outdoor seating area is also very limited. So, I usually come here before work and get my coffee to go before making the 1.5 hour commute down to San Jose. If you like dependably good quality coffee and just want it to go (you don't need a place to sit down in work) or you loveeee mocha's, I'd recommend this place."", ""Good hipster coffee. Came by with a group of friends after eating an early dinner to get some caffeine to explore SF. I got a regular drip coffee which was strong and a bit acidic. My fiance got the cold brew which was really good. Strong and bold, but not too acidic. Service was good. Seating available, but wouldn't recommend this place to get work done (unless you have noise canceling headphones or something) as theres lots of people coming in and out and people who were seated were mainly chatting with friends."", ""3.5 starsTL;DR1. Good coffee (iced lattes were yum!)2. Crazy prices (two iced lattes were $10... sorry, what?!)3. Cute interior (big, bright, airy, modern)4. It was very cold, though (they keep the doors open on both ends of the cafe)5. Bathroom was a mess (Like, second/triple/quadruple-guess how much you actually have to go, messy and gross.)Gave a three as I doubt I'd return. There are too many awesome coffee shops to settle on a mediocre one - sorry!"", ""Pros: the coffee, the service, the pastries, holy cow a coffee shop that doesn't close at 5p in SFCons: SF + good coffee = overpriced Finding a good coffee shop in SF that stays open past sunset is more frustrating then being delayed at the airport. For some reason, it is really really hard to find ANY open coffee shop in 90% of the city after 530p. Yet another sign that SF is not really ready to be considered a primetime major city worth it's rep...but I digress. This all makes Ritual really stand out to me. First it's open until 8 everyday(!!). Second, the coffee is good. Really good. This is the perfect place to buy a distinctly SF gift for your F&F. I would say the coffee is usually more tasty and not as brutally strong as sightglass, and more refined than Philz. Service is friendly and quick. In true SF fashion, you can encounter long lines on weekend mornings but otherwise it's usually very reasonable. You can also expect a very reasonable selection of pastries and on a sunny day there is cool outdoor seating. Indoor seating is \xa0plentiful and offers numerous work spaces. Like all cafes in SF, using the bathroom can be adventurous bc of the homeless problem but it is available. Caveats? I have no idea how WiFi works here bc I don't trust/do public WiFi (use at your own risk). Paying $5 for coffee is also frankly not sustainable for most folks. Refills? Overall: highly recommended (but please don't crowd me out on Sunday morning ok?)"", ""First time here on Valencia, nice open space, cool art for sale and simple menu. Pros: * Easy access, and outdoor wooden seating * dog friendly * clean and organized * spacious * iced latte = really smooth, shot extracted to perfection * cafe macchiato = too astringent, shot not extracted properly, or not calibrated recently Cons:* on a Sunday morning, I would expect some enthusiasm from the baristas! This was not the case of a single employee working. Drink a shot, or two! Wake up and smell the beans! Smile- it won't hurt. *street parking only, and not a lot of it*beans are very expensive! 3/5 stars due to poor customer service, and a sub par macchiato."", ""The deco and space are stunning but I question the quality of the coffee. I wanted to get a latte but the selection is from the espresso list. One of the three features a single origin coffee from Brazil. I was quite surprised. Brazil beans are not well known for its quality because of the low latitude and also the overall strategy emphasizing on quantity over quality. Honestly, I have never seen a single coffee shop featuring Brazilian single origin beans. So instead, I got a brew called Hambela Gotiti since usually a pour over is always going to be better than espresso. The Hambela Gotiti was average though. Ethiopia beans are well known for their nice acidity and floral and fruity notes like written on the menu like blueberry and lilac. But the roast of the beans pretty much killed the notes. I had to pour milk in it for me to keep drinking it. What is interesting though, is that the coffee tastes a little better on my way back because the temperature goes down a bit. That is when I can taste the notes a bit more. But after it cools down even more, it does not taste good anymore. Anyways, like the vibe but don't come for the actual coffee. Not worth your money."", ""nice place for coffee in mission district as it's a big open space with a modern and clean atmosphere. the light fixtures are unique and a cool touch to the place. i wish they had flavors for coffee like a vanilla latte for example, but the coffee was still good nonetheless.

Reason being is that this was their very first location that opened its doors back in 2005. Since then, they now have a total of 6 coffee shops; 5 in San Francisco and 1 in Napa. Located in the heart of the Mission District directly on Valencia St. (in between 21st and 22nd St\'s), many people who have never been here before may not even realize the business is here. Their trademark is a red flag resembling a star and an outline of what looks like a coffee cup. My lady and I arrived roughly around 10:30am on a beautiful Saturday morning. Since we drove here, we luckily found parking right outside the business! Do keep in mind that this is metered parking which the city charges Monday through Saturday.Upon entering, the building itself has a long rectangular shape to it. From an aesthetics perspective, it is very spacious, inviting, and bright. And with the light earth tone colored walls throughout, it allows an abundance of natural light inside. There are a few select prints along the walls and area to purchase their coffee beans, coffee mugs, high-end espresso machines, and even books. This is an example of one of many coffee houses that almost has the look and feel of an art gallery.Ritual offers a simplistic yet effective menu of options. Everything from basic brewed coffee to drinks that are used with the Hario V60 dripper. And of course your basic espresso drinks including cappuccinos, macchiatos, lattes, and mochas. They also offer a nice little tea selection as well as hot chocolate and Chai lattes. There is a pastry selection including croissants, muffins, and scones but the choices are quite limited.As far as our drinks, I ended up ordering a 16 oz. Cold Brew w/cream while she opted for their \'hot\' Latte w/vanilla syrup added (available at the condiment station). We also split a blueberry vanilla scone to share. Both our drinks come out within a minute of another as we both grabbed a seat inside by the window. My drink packed a nice punch as I loved the bitterness and strength of their coffee. Her latte was very creamy, frothy, and sweet while the espresso flavor was on point. Overall, we were both very impressed with the delicate process of making their coffee drinks at ""Ritual Coffee Roasters"". The reason why I am deducting a star from this place is that there is no Wi-Fi! C\'mon guys, your business is one of the major tech cities in the world, at least let us connect online! Another is that their are no power outlets for charging your phone/tablet/laptop. And finally, the prices are a bit steep but keep in mind, this is San Francisco when everything is at a premium. Aside from those little negatives, I still highly recommend this place for the avid coffee drinker. My rating, four solid stars.', ""One of my favorite places to grab coffee in San Francisco! \xa0I usually grab a cup whenever I stroll around the Mission or hang out at Dolores Park - I would go much more often if they had locations closer to me. \xa0I usually order a standard cold brew when I come by, and it's really good. \xa0It's definitely a step up from other cold brews I've had in the city, and it hits the spot in terms of meeting my caffeine needs. \xa0Their coffee here is a bit pricey, but then again coffee everywhere is getting pretty pricey. \xa0Lines aren't too long - they typically move fast and the drinks are usually given to me right after I put my order in. \xa0This specific location looked like it had a lot of seating, so it could be a great place to read a book or get some work done if that's what you're looking to do."", 'San Francisco has a LOT of great coffee, and there are quite a few places in the city where you can get an amazing cup of joe. However, if you find yourself in the Mission and are craving a coffee, Ritual should be your first choice. Here\'s what\'s so awesome about it:1) The coffee! Both their pour-over (V60) coffee and espresso are great. They have multiple options for either, meaning you can choose exactly the flavor profile you want. They roast all their own beans, and while you can find them at many different stores around town, the best selection and freshest roasts are all here. They also offer a few teas.2) The food! They offer both regular and vegan pastries, meaning people with a dairy allergy can also grab a pastry to go with their coffee. Their vegan donuts are particularly good!3) The service! As I said above, there is a lot of good coffee in SF, but (unfortunately) there are also quite a few snobby/pretentious baristas too. Luckily, you won\'t find any of them here, as every Ritual barista I\'ve had has been super friendly and approachable about any and all questions I\'ve had, no matter how ""basic"" they have been. This is super refreshing!4) The space! A wonderful setting with lots of seating and even a cute back patio that offers a bit of quiet in a very loud city. All in all, Ritual is one of my favorite places to go for coffee in San Francisco, and my top choice in the Mission. Give it a try!']"
Ballast Coffee,"['Coffee: perfectSpace: good for working and the outdoor area is lovely Staff: super friendly Highly recommend', 'Ok the lack of art problem is solved, now they hang art from local artist and students on their walls. They have slowly been adding plants and arts and it looks great! I have to say, the dollar sign is not correct for a coffee shop, I would say $4.5 late would be a two dollar sign category. Regardless, they have good coffee, nice decor inside, and my favorite is their backyard. I just go there to have some coffee and sit in the sun. :)', ""Matcha latte was great - strong and flavorful like it should be. Definitely one of the best matcha lattes I've had in the city. The vibe is relaxed and inviting, and it's easy to get work done. Modern but not overly gentrified, cozy but well kept. Extra points for the r&b jams. SF native approved!"", ""This coffee shop is very bright & had a welcoming vibe. Like another helper has said, I don't think this is a $ establishment. The prices are pretty high, but maybe it's because we're in the city. When we went, they only had the barako beans, which is a very dark and bitter roast. I'm glad I got a matcha latte because I'm a medium roast kinda gal. On to the matcha latte... it was honestly lacking the matcha flavor I was wanting based on other great reviews. Maybe it was just my cup, but was latte was quite watery and I had no honey flavor until I got to the very bottom of my cup. The lattes itself were made beautifully, the milk frothed perfectly, but the flavors just did not wow me."", ""I love visiting new coffee shops in the city but I was a bit disappointed by Ballast. Reasons include: they were out of their speciality barako blend (special coffee blend from the Philippines that I was excited to try) and the matcha americano I got was so bitter and tasteless that I couldn't finish more than half of it. I also love matcha too so it was surprising that I didn't like it at all.I did like the minimalist decor and there were a lot customers there with their laptops enjoying their day. I also enjoyed the Third Culture mochi donuts. I tried the ube and passion fruit. I will have to think about if I want to go back and try their special blend."", ""This is a really great coffee shop. It feels like home and there is plenty of seating, tables, and even an outdoor courtyard that is really nice. Their coffee means I tried that day was from the Philippines which was really different. The staff was friendly and I really enjoyed my time there. Plenty of plugs and Wi-Fi too which is good if you have to do some work on your laptop.I'll be back to Ballast Coffee."", ""First of all, such a friendly atmosphere for sure! Glad to walk in here to be greeted lightly by the workers here and sometimes it's nice to get asked how you're day is going, don't ya think? Even if it's part of their job. Enough with the random babblings and onto the good stuff..Coffee is good, my go-to is their matcha latte w/ almond milk but if they do run out of that i opt for any other interesting coffee.. so far i've tried the Barako latte w/ almond milk and the reg. cappuccino, all rich with the tasty flavor. the ambiance is chill and the music is perfect, not too loud and too mainstream, more on the mellow side. which is good for studying or what not. you can still definitely talk over the music if you're in there for a meeting or coffee with a friend. i like how almost all tables have outlets. they also have seats in the back (almost like a backyard area) during the day if you want some vitamin D while sipping on your coffee / tea or water! plenty of sunlight here so that's why i like coming here as well. would totally be back here, since it's simply a muni ride here for me and west portal have pretty good restaurants nearby in case you get hungry for lunch or dinner."", 'I have been to this cafe once before it was renovated. I miss this location because of the indoor and outdoor settings which are friendly to work at. I LIKE it even moreee after the renovation! It is way more spacious, clean, quiet and comfortable to hang out for an afternoon! \xa0It is crazy how thoughtful the design of this place is, you get to choose sitting on a couch, at a small table, big table, bar, or even outdoor table! I definitely enjoy sitting at the big wooden table in the back because it is more hidden and relaxing! Drink: I asked the barista the difference between a cappuccino ($4) and a cortado ($4), he told me the cortado is the same as the cappuccino but just with less milk. I ordered it and regretted it right away because it tasted like a creamy shot to me, but I will definitely go back and try their other drinks next time :) Sweet: \xa0they have 4-5 flavors of cake. I tried a matcha custard cake ($4) and a ube custard cake ($4), very moist! I wish they have more food/cake choices herePro: the location is very easy for parking, there is a plenty of 2 hr parking a block away. \xa0Restroom is clean!! Staffs are friendly!! Music is not tooo loud and intrusive', ""Ballast Coffee is a nice work space. Came in around 12:30pm on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty packed, there was no more indoor seating but there was space on the patio outdoors which was super nice, but unfortunately there are no outlets. By 2:00pm the place was packed, including the patio so if you're interested in studying or working here probably aim to get here earlier in the morning.I got the Just Like Honey tea, which was $4. It comes in a nice glass teapot that turns into a cup lmao which I thought was super cute. The tea itself was okay; would have liked a little bit stronger flavor personally but I still enjoyed it.I left about 1.5 hours after getting here because my laptop died lol. So yeah, if you're trying to do a work day here, probably try to get here earlier. Would recommend around 9am-10am."", 'Great little neighborhood cafe serving distinct, quality beverages - featuring Barako Coffee from the PI - with nice backyard seating to boot!I stumbled upon this cafe when searching for good coffee spots in The City. I was intrigued by their Barako Coffee offering, a varietal originating from the Philippines. This was my first time hearing of coffee grown in the Philippines, and was surprised and excited to find Ballast Coffee serving this rare product in SF. Inside, it can get a bit dark, especially in the middle section of the space, right at the register and bar. But things open and brighten up the further you move back, where you\'ll find seating with high chairs as well as a communal table, terminating in a nice and open backyard setup. It seems to be good spot for work or study: plenty of people on their laptops and devices. On our visit, we went Barako crazy, ordering two Barako cappuccinos, a Barako espresso, and a matcha custard cake (from Third Culture Bakery). They had other pastry options, including day-old donuts from Dynamo at 50% off. Sweet deal.I liked the Barako beans. Ballast calls it a ""big, hearty brew,"" and I agree. \xa0The espresso reminded me of a more traditional flavor, tasting like a darker roast, with a kind of deep earthiness, full body, and low acidity: in line with attributes commonly found in varietals produced in Southeast Asia. It\'s a welcomed alternative to the typical Third Wave flavor profile offerings found in SF. The steamed milk in the cappuccino sweetened things up ever so slightly, making a well balanced cup. I would definitely come back to have these beverages again!All in all, a great place to sit down and enjoy a unique cup of coffee!', ""Not bad at all! Came here on a Saturday afternoon looking for some coffee and a place to work. I've visited the old coffee shop that was here before it became Ballast and the space has definitely brightened up. I ordered a cappuccino and sat at one of their smaller tables to work. It seemed like a popular place since everyone around me was there working on their laptops, homework, or writing, which created a great working environment for me. They apparently have outdoor tables which I would love to check out once the weather gets nicer. Their single working tables are pretty small, and the bar-like counter was also small. There is also a larger table in the back of the shop if you're looking for more space."", ""YuckThe former Green House Cafe was warm and inviting. It had cozy areas for either solo work or small groups. \xa0It had FOOD and it was pretty good. \xa0Now. \xa0It's cold, modern, horrible tinky music that's way too loud and distracting. \xa0The new modern look and layout makes all sound reverberate and bounce off walls. \xa0It's about as warm and inviting as a refrigerator.Now. \xa0No food! \xa0And their wall board that lists beverages is impossible to read unless you walk behind the counter and get on top of it!They were also out of the coffee they claim to specialize in. \xa0Strange place. \xa0Won't be back"", ""This place had good coffee and friendly service, but I wasn't a fan of the space itself.My husband and I enjoyed our Americanos. \xa0Also, the cups they were served in were quite attractive.The setting unfortunately felt a bit cold and sterile - I'm afraid the old, unattractive floor tile took away from the decor. \xa0Also, it was disappointing that the bathroom did not have a changing table (we were there with our baby).Overall, a good spot to get coffee in West Portal."", ""This place is an amazing place to get work done. The cafe is spacious and clean with modern decor. It wasn't crowded when I was here on a Monday afternoon. It isn't too loud, they have relaxing music playing in the background. The wifi password is on the counter and it is fast. The staff is very friendly and occasionally sing along with the radio lol. The coffee here is great and was strong enough to power me through a couple hours of work. Overall a great study spot in West Portal."", 'very, very intriguing. What had really caught my eye on this place was the fact that they serve Barako coffee, a coffee varietal indigenous and produced mainly in the Philippines. It is known for its strong, bold flavor, but it is not always well received. It\'s sharp and poignant, but is mainly dependent on its roast flavor rather than the bean itself. I have sampled and drank a many different Barako offerings, and they all generally lean towards very dark flavors. Good for you ""dark"" coffee drinkers. Such reasons are why I was surprised to see such an...acquired coffee to be offered here, so brownie points for being ambitious. Now, the shop itself is very quaint and small, the ceiling is fairly low and may seem a tad cramped. But it is spacious and welcoming with its layout and theme of white. They do have a back area if the inside doesn\'t suit you. They source their pastries from a very good handful of known bakeries in SF, such as Dynamo Donuts. Aside from their Barako offering, their other espresso is very smooth and generally more well balanced, which I preferred. They also have matcha as another alternative offering for those who like matcha. All in all I was happy with my visit and I\'m glad to see a coffee shop (THE ONLY ONE IN THE BAY AREA) serve such a generally unknown coffee varietal (as a permanent offering). I salute you Ballast!', ""I've been an irregular customer, as it were, since a couple of months after Ballast opened. I was not a habituee of the old joint that seems to have been beloved by many. \xa0Even though I dig the space, I'd file this cafe under 'Hit or Miss'. I've had well-rendered drinks from (one of the) owner(s) who is there on and off. More often than not, I've had drinks made by folk who aren't actually up to snuff yet in the drinks-making department. This means, of course, that one is either spending four plus bucks on a good milk and espresso drink or not. And the latter scenario bunk. I mean, who likes paying to be a guinea pig? New hires learning how to make drinks on the job, i.e. drinks patrons are shelling out bucks for ain't kosher. (I understand that this is a somewhat common practice, but I still don't dig it.)The last time I was in Ballast, a new hire (the boss was training him while I was there, so I'm not guessing that he was newly employed) was making my capp while making small talk with the owner. I had wanted the boss to make the drink, but no such luck. I was hoping the new-hire wouldn't be distracted by the chat, but, given that the milk was overly hot and the espresso had a talc/tannic quality about it, it would seem that he had been. Dude set the drink on the saucer, gave not one glance at me, and, while still facing his boss, told him that he was unhappy with the foam art on my drink. I'm one foot over the counter from you, so why don't you not talk about how your drink doesn't measure up in front of patrons, or tell me directly. In all reality, I don't give a fig if you can make a feather or a heart or a gosh darn toy poodle in the foam. I do care that you don't scald the milk, do have the right grind, do have a machine that's been correctly calibrated, etc. It's substance over form all day long. If you can achieve both, then fab. If not then err on the side of the drink being balanced. \xa0If you don't really care how your drink tastes or if you're not ordering espresso and milk drinks, then Ballast is a modern, tidy space you may well enjoy spending time in.**Back patio seating. **Tidy loo."", ""New-ish place. We were sad to see Green House go but Ballast has been an awesome addition to the neighborhood, great for the days when Peet's is feeling too generic. Enjoying a wonderfully strong latte this morning, really taking the edge off the Monday fog."", 'Came into the coffee shop today and there was a guitarist playing...softly. \xa0Just like the coffee shops of your dreams. \xa0We enjoyed the latte coffee (split between the 3 of us), enough caffeine to power through the rest of the afternoon! \xa0Come and smell the coffee! \xa0I would have liked to stay and relax in the empty outdoor patio area, maybe next time!', ""One of my absolute favorite cafes in the city. I come here multiple times a week just to get a drink and read a book! There's a good amount of seating, but it usually fills up pretty quickly around the afternoon time. They play good music and the ambiance is really nice. The baristas are all really friendly too. I've ordered the matcha green tea latte and the genmaicha green tea before, and both were really good. I've never had an issue with parking. I park about 2 blocks down where there's 2 hour parking.I would highly recommend this place!!"", ""Met a friend here recently after an incredible lunch at Bursa. Wow! It's unassuming from the outside but is a beautiful hip, spacious haven inside. Staff are really nice and knowledgeable and seriously aim to please. Art of the walls is pretty and much appreciated. It's got a minimal flavor in Ballast - a little goes a long way. It is hip that's for sure (did I mention?) but not overpriced or snooty. It feels like a very down to earth vibe even though yes it is exquisitely curated throughout. The best thing about this spot was the terrace out back. What a sun trap if you go at the right time of day. My friend and I messed around with taking some polaroid pics, chatting to other Ballast coffee frequenters, and chilling in the March sunshine. My friend had a drip coffee which she liked and I had a matcha green tea latte unsweetened which was divine! So so good and of course, this place being the kind that pays attention to detail, the drink was finished beautifully with gorgeous latte art! Enjoy the pics and get yourself to Ballast - probably the best coffee shop in West Portal... :)""]"

It's a recipe the owner learned that uses fresh ingredients to help our body, mind, and soul. So delicious as well! I had there latte as well which is really good and the best part is that it comes with a cheese pop up. Yum yum yum I also had their mushroom Gorgonzola empanada.

She even volunteers in India .... isn't that wonderful? Love love love"", 'Saltroot is my favorite go to place if I want Pao De Quejo! They make it fresh if I order for pick up.

Noticed they serve Intelligentsia coffee here. And you get a cheese pop free with a hot drink!I got the classic parmesan cheese pop (pao de queijo) with my coffee. It is not your traditional cheesy bread pop. It is made with cassava. The place also makes sliders out of the cheese pops. The empanadas section was quite interesting too. Good food overall and great service.', ""Yummy! \xa0Ordered from this spot & had it in my hand super fast. The sandwiches are delicious though I preferred the tomato and basil.

It's a great place to read or get some work done! This place has relaxing and upbeat music with and large inviting Windows. When I first walked in, I was pleasantly surprised that the heater was turned on.

Anyway...I'm a little disappointed they don't do chai lattes here, BUT the tea is good and it comes with a delicious popover! I chose the Parmesan one, found it to be so good that I ordered two more--one parm and one guava. They're slightly crispy/crunchy on the outside with a soft, gooey-like interior. The texture is quite pleasant. The parm one is cheesy and savory, so delicious! The guava one tastes like guava and is just the right amount of sweetness. It didn't have as much guava filling as some of the their pictures I saw though. Both are great with tea! \xa0I'll def be back for more tea and popovers!"", ""I came to this cafe with my sister and her friends on a Saturday morning and it was not busy at all. This is a small and intimate shop with limited seating so it's not ideal for big groups. I think a lot of people tend to grab and go rather than sit down so I think you would be able to find a place to seat if you plan to dine-in. The shop seems to be run by just one guy (at least when we were there), so the service can be a bit on the slower end, but the wait is not bad at all. My favorite part of this place is that they give you a FREE cheese puff with any hot drink purchases. This includes any of the coffees and teas but excludes the juices. There are a couple of different flavors for the cheese puffs that you can order in addition but the cheese puff that comes with the drink is the original one. I absolutely loved the texture of the cheese puffs. It reminded me of the mocha bread at Asian bakery sometimes since it's pretty chewy. My sister had ordered a guava cheese puffs with her orange juice, and I was a little surprised that the guava cheese puffs are still on the more savory side. The cheese flavor for these cheese puffs are pretty strong so they are on the savory end even if you order the sweeter flavors like guava. I had ordered the tea with turmeric and ginger because I was feeling a bit under the weather and it was pretty good. It was definitely on the lighter side but I just liked that they had the option that seemed to hit the spot for someone who wasn't feeling well. It was a great alternative to the coffee drinks.The menu was pretty simple, which I liked. They also have free wifi! I think this is a nice little cafe and would love to come back and try out the other cheese puff flavors."", 'Love the Brazilian pao cheese popovers in flavors including classic parmesean and unusual guava jam...and that they also sell them packaged and frozen in other flavors such as gorgonzola, onion & parsley and potato & mustard. I will definitely try the other flavors.', 'My friends and I took a field trip to the Legion of Honor museum one morning, and the best part was coming to Saltroot Cafe afterwards. The exhibit wasn\'t as thrilling as coming here to have a coffee and try their incredible food. It\'s a small and quaint cafe, but we managed to secure a table in the corner.Each beverage comes with a cheese pop-ups, which looks so simple but makes your taste buds explode with joy. It\'s dangerous that they sell these for taking home... I could sit in front of Netflix and snack on them forever. The empanadas are amazing, too. So fresh, flaky, and tasty.Everything about the experience at Saltroot Cafe is carefully crafted. It feels casual yet classy to be here. The combination of the furniture, decor, and presentation of coffee and pastries creates the perfect environment to relax and have a good conversation with friends.

It's also a really covenient spot to go to since it has an OK amount of parking near the little tennis courts. Food- OMG the cheese and guava puffs are amazing!! I could not stop.

It's a great spot for a little before dinner, post dinner snack.Overall- It's a tiny spot, but I haven't had an issue finding a seat.

Blue Bottle Coffee,"[""Blue Bottle Coffee is what I hope to find in an urban coffee shop buried in San Francisco's South Of Market district. Turns out, Blue Bottle is a local chain, started in Oakland, now sprawling the globe with over 50 locations. Despite the mold, the store we walked into provided a first-time experience for us.The atmosphere is up-cycled industrial conversion, occupying a first floor corner space in an office building on Mint Plaza that reeks of story. The line for service was literally out the door when we walked up on a typically sunny, temperate San Fran Saturday morning. Always on the hunt for something new, we ordered New Orleans Cold Brew, a swirly mixture of milk and dark and smooth cold brew that was robust without being bitter. We both normally want to sweeten our coffee. But this brew was just so good, we didn't want to alter it in any way. We also tried a Siphon Coffee, something I'd never heard of. Apparently, it uses a Japanese-manufactured device that happened to be set up directly in front of where we sat. They heat the coffee to a specific temperature and brew it directly in the water in a flask straight from high school chemistry lab without a filter, skimming the grounds when they pour it out (see my pix). It's served in a beaker with cold water to clear the pallet between sips. I don't know how different it really was (I'm a bit too hoi polloi to perceive the distinction). But, it was fun and unusual. The barista who made it for us was informative and kind enough to answer all my Siphon-newb questions.We also ordered Avocado Toast, which was exceptional. But, center stage was the coffee. High marks for service, experience, atmosphere, quality, and variety. If there was a Blue Bottle near me, I'd hit it all the time. Highly recommended!"", 'Great coffee; smooth lattes.Avocado toast is okay. Idk what the hype is about. Always a line so it takes about 15 minutes to get your coffee.They just changed to paper straws idk why.... I thought their blue straw was a signature mark that I loved having bc it was so unique!!!!!!!!', ""I was visiting SF for a week and I had to try this place out. I've heard of the brand and the 1000+ positive reviews sold it for me. When I got there, the line was out of the door and took about 10 minutes to pass through, so don't be intimidated by it. I got a Japanese style drip coffee. It was very thick and rich cold brew. It was intense but still drinkable. It was very very good and if it was affordable and living there I would definitely drink this every StaurdayI also got a Tahini cookie. Unfortunately I did not really enjoy the tahini cookie. It was too sweet and a little mealy"", 'Yummy new orleans coffee. Came as expected. Good treat.', ""This location is a little tucked away from the busy bustle of Powell and Market. I usually meet people around Powell when I get off BART, so when I'm early, I like to pop in here to grab a cup of coffee while I wait for my friends. Most recently I had their cappuccino with oat milk (offered, but not shown on the menu), and it was perfection. Staff are always so friendly here!"", ""Pretty bougie place but the hype isn't letting me down. I only ever came here twice and I had the same order, an iced mocha but the second time around I tried it with almond milk and I actually quite prefer it. Although it's an extra dollar, it was worth it because my lactose intolerant a$$ would have never forgiven me if I had gotten the courage to ingest actual f**king dairy. I also had a couple pastries and they were definitely tasty. One was the blonde mini corn bread (I think that's what it was \u200d) and the rose flavored pastry. Very aromatic but wasn't entirely my cup of paste-tea-ree (har har). Would totally come here again.pretty low-key location too and it's next to a couple dispensaries if that's anything worth adding lol"", ""I love trying new coffee places so we had to stop by when we were in the area. Look for the blue bottle since the name isn't outside and could be easily passed up. The line went pretty quick and the cashier was nice. I ordered the mocha and it was pretty sweet but good.

I arrived to find line around the corner. Thankfully, it went quick and I was in and out within 15 minutes. I ordered the original cold brew with a bit of almond milk. After slurping it down I was decided I'd have to I return the next day and order a hot coffee. The following day I went with the caffe latte added almond milk and a bit of sugar.

Located in Mint Plaza, it is a relatively small cafe compared to their other sites. The volume of customers in a narrow space also makes it a cacophonous experience; if you are looking for a quiet place to chat or work, this place is NOT it. However, I've never been disappointed by the coffee quality, and the service is generally friendly and welcoming despite the long lines. If you are ordering an espresso-based drink, be prepared to wait for a bit if you are visiting during peak times. You can also sit in the nearby plaza if the cafe's tables are occupied. If shopping at the Westfield Mall has you feeling sleepy, this Blue Bottle is great for a pick-me-up or a small snack."", ""I was visiting SF 2 weeks ago and came here for breakfast with my gf and her daughter; our experience was great.

My gf had the avocado toast w/ poached egg, which was great; the dish was fresh and tasty. I had the Belgian waffle w/ poached eggs, which was a delicious mix of sweet and savory. My gf's had the Belgian waffle w/ bacon, which was also very tasty. We also had some warm and fresh coffees and hot chocolate. The service was good and the ambiance nice. I don't usually go to coffee shops back home, but SF really knows how to do them. Also, much like everything else worth having here in SF, you will have to wait, so bring your patience. Other than that, I would recommend this place and look forward to returning."", ""If I could give this place 7 stars, I would! This particular location was 10 mins walking distance from our hotel and I had never had a chance to go to blue bottle when I lived in NYC. We decided to grab an early breakfast here. \xa0While walking to it, the area seemed a little sketchy but we didn't feel unsafe. I got the cappuccino with their house made oat milk which \xa0was recommended by Valerie (our cashier), the avocado toast and some type of sweet oat bread.I told Valerie how it was my first time at blue bottle and how I have always wanted to try it. She was so nice about it and gave us our drinks complimentary as a gesture of appreciation for trying them out!Customer service overall was stellar and so was the taste of food and drinks. Definitely going back!Thank you Valerie for making taking our experience to the next level!"", ""Best Mocha I've ever had! So rich in coffee taste and very lightly sweetened. The chocolate flavor was strong but not to the point that it overwhelmed the coffee. They blended in just perfectly. I also tried their New Orleans latte with almond milk and man what a good combo they made! I like how when they hand the drinks out to the customers, they don't include the lids, which kinda makes the drinks look a bit like an alcohol drink, which also could save some lids for the environment! All the Blue Bottle coffee drinks have this very signature taste that other places don't have, which has a light hint of salt and cream after taste, really unique! Love the busy and sociable ambience at the store too. You should come and try that for yourself."", ""Makes my top 3 coffee spots in SF!It is on the corner of an alley way that bends; there's like two parking spots right outside, but they're often taken by people who work next door. Across the street, there's a huge parking structure you can pay for. Many types of public transport also converge around this part of downtown. It's very, very hip! Tall ceilings, bar seating, and a couple cute tables line the exterior. Their drip coffee is made to order, using a single funnel. It's on the smaller side, so I wouldn't come here to do work with a group. I'm pretty sure I made myself a WiFi hot spot too. Every single one of their pastries is DELICIOUS and pair beautifully with the bitter coffee. Their coffee is extremely caffeinated, the way it should be. I came in during this afternoon this time and ordered an affogato for the first time, along with some baked goods because I couldn't resist. The ice cream was walnut cream and surrendered nicely to the espresso notes. Will definitely return for coffee if I have an early morning in this area!"", ""I really love BB coffee and try to have it as often as possible.After a long day of touring the city I needed caffeine and I needed it bad. The wifey and I had stopped in to grab some ice cream and I realized that coffee and ice cream may actually snap me out of how exhausted I was.I opted for the New Orleans coffee. Wow. I learned I do not like chicory. No downgrade to them - I should stick with what I know and not branch out. I sucked it down anyways because I needed the jolt. The average stars is the location. I felt like the customer service was meh at best and the line took quite while. I assumed a location used to a tourism influx would handle the pressure of a line a tad better and more efficiently.Thanks for the coffee - it did its job. I'll stick to ordering my normal. I'll also avoid this location if possible."", 'Found this little spot the other weekend while I was staying in the city. My hotel was in union square and I try to avoid big corporate businesses when it comes to food, coffee, etc. (nothing better than tasting & supporting local businesses).Found this place on yelp and glad I did. Coffee was delicious but I\'ll add they don\'t carry ""flavors"" not even vanilla. Which ok, I get it\'s a small shop but I don\'t think it\'s going on a limb to carry a couple of popular flavors.I wish I was hungry when I went because I saw the avocado toast being made and it looked delicious! Highly recommend this coffee spot!']"
Cafe Josephine,"['Awesome place! Grilled cheese with Apple is a must. We had it and our boys had it without the apple. So yummy. Everything is really good. Loved the Mediterranean bars and the apple sauce was spectacular. Please open another location in the city so we can have your food more often.', ""The Randall museum gets packed full of small children and their parents running around learning things, so as a result Cafe Josephine also shares the same population. If you are looking for a nice quiet peaceful spot to grab a coffee and read a book, this may not be the ideal place for you. They have a cute little cafe space with a couple of baristas serving up high-quality coffee, tea, and bagels and sandwiches. There is a lovely outdoor patio space, however they don't provide enough tables, and as a result the four or five tables end up feeling a little bit cramped next to your neighbors. The overall vibe is like a watering hole for parents to restock on caffeine to continue running around with their children, while stopping in for a little snack break. The view is lovely though, and I would certainly return earlier in the morning for some peace and quiet."", ""Well wouldn't this have been great when Law School Girl was little and we were at the Randall all of the time?

It was clean and sweet. They had an array of goodies to offer. I had a baguette with salami and cheddar which was delicious and my son had a fruit cup and apple juice that he loved.

Also got a lemon poppy donut ($4?) which was good but definitely could\'ve passed on that.I\'ll admit I was a little shook when my total was $10.25 as I don\'t think I liked the drink and donut enough to want to pay $10 again, but I can see myself coming back for a regular cup of coffee ($3.25).', ""They must be writing their own reviews. \xa0No Wi Fi here; one of these anti-tech coffee shops. \xa0Who pays the rent around the corner?

The interior is medium minimal and not the complete experience. I took a Lyft to Haight Street and got to this coffee shop too early. Note: It opens at 7am not 6:30am. So I had no idea what I should get. I asked for something on the menu and they did not have it. So then I chose ""Gakoma,"" which sounds like ""glaucoma,"" the eye disease. It was an overpriced coffee after all at $4. I asked for some milk and I didn\'t know where it was...then I wanted soy milk and I got it from the counter dude. I was lost in my experience today. The menu is confusing and eccentric. They don\'t have the ""cherry bomb"" like in the Castro. I didn\'t even see chai on the menu...so the menu is different at different Ritual Coffee shops. This one on Haight does not celebrate Haight Street. This is overpriced coffee!!! Ritual is a unique experience because of BRANDING. But it\'s OVERPRICED.Review #2020.', ""I couldn't help my excitement as I saw this from fellow Yelper's post and spontaneously stumbling upon Ritual. I was walking from The Painted Ladies to Haight and Ashbury when me and my friend from Japan I was touring both needed to use a restroom. So we decided to stop and check Ritual Coffee. It was a perfect tourist detour to drink and recharge before heading to Haight and Ashbury.1. One locked restroom is available upon request2. Many tables, a window seated corner with red cylinders. At first look, thought were seats but, what I actually realized were tables.3. I only spotted one outlet to charge a mobile device.4. Order then pay. I was sort of confused on how the payment worked.

Now specifically, the Haight location is more of a cozy, secluded place--where you can enjoy your cup far from the busy bustle of SF streets (in comparison to some of the other locations). You can still get your fix with the included benefit of easier to find parking. I tried many a drinks here, I find their espresso to be more on the acidic palette, but it's rarely detected when consuming say a cappuccino or a latte. Their coffee has great body and mouth feel, but the notes and acidity aren't for the faint of heart. They take their coffee seriously and it does show through what they produce. Another note, your coffee will never taste the same come the new season...for they have seasonal espresso blends come in every season change. They have sometimes circulated previous espresso blends, but in other cases (i.e. Teen Age Riot, Acid Test) are special on occasion or temporal exceptions. Meaning they make blends in compliment to whatever season it is as well (i.e. Cabin Fever in Winter). Don't ever change Ritual, as well as your notes of Angst and Freedom."", 'College student here and I always come to this cafe but the baristas are unfriendly and inattentive. When asking a question, I was told by one of the baristas to ""order at the register"" and I was asked if I ""can wait,"" which I gladly agreed. This is my THIRD time at this cafe and the service depends on the person. The coffee is a solid 7/10 and I\'ve ordered their lattes, but I feel like it depends on the person who is making them. Once I had a latte in which the espresso was still sitting at the bottom and the milk was at the top! Also, I typically order almond milk and on one occasion, the barista had forgotten. Because of a milk allergy, I found out that day by feeling sick, which was honestly not fun.One thing that they have never done was ask for my name for my drink. Also, it would be nice too if some of the baristas didn\'t try to ring up customers as quickly as possible.... Ironically, they often they treat older customers with more respect, attention, and patience. It is unfortunate, because I have plenty of younger friends who would have enjoyed coming here FOR THE COFEE.

But after today\'s extremely rude and hostile interaction with one of the workers who refused to make my usual drink that they have made many times before I will certainly not go back and will urge my friends and neighbors not to go there either. All I asked for was them using half Almond milk and half Soy milk, as all soy is too much soy, and all almond milk doesn\'t froth up at when steamed. It\'s a great combination for anyone who doesn\'t want a dairy milk latte. Everyone there has been accommodating before for this simple request but today the barista decided ""we don\'t do that"". To which I replied ""really? you have many times before"". She went off not even saying, sorry we can\'t do it, it\'s against company policy to mix milks or whatever her rationale was, she just kept saying ""we don\'t do that"". But they do! Anyways she conceded and agreed to make the drink, took my money, made the other drink I ordered for my girlfriend, and then at the last second reverted to saying again ""we don\'t make that, pick one almond milk or soy milk!"" Super offended by her abrasive negative attitude and unfriendliness I got a refund and left.

For example, a matcha latte with oat milk (yes they have Oatly!!!) sets me back ~$7 with tax and tip. Drip coffee is more affordable, at $3-$4. They also have pastries here from Third Culture bakery!

Very cool.We ordered an oat milk decaf cappuccino, regular cappuccino, and matcha custard cake (they have a selection of tasty treats from Third Culture Bakery to enjoy with your coffee). Heads up! For those who are looking for milk alternatives, they don't serve soy milk here. They carry almond milk or oat milk, however.On a personal note, I really appreciate the company's attentiveness to customer experiences.

But once you get past the ordering experience, you should be golden. Personal favorite on the menu: potato leek soup"", ""Jane on the weekend has a pretty long line if you're willing to wait the long wait. As you're waiting in line, you get to scope out what everyone orders as the waiters bring the plates out which is nice.

My boyfriend ordered an egg sandwich and a walnut + fig toast. They were both delicious dishes! Very hearty meals. I'd love to try the salads and smoothies next time. It's a good mix of choices for the bigger, hungrier stomach or a light bowl of goodness for those who enjoy their greens!

The salad includes kale, brussels, sweet potatoes and quinoa of course. It's covered in a citrusy dressing that puts it over the edge.

We also tried the walnut and fig ricotta toast, the crazy cookie, and the almond butter + preserves bird bread toast.

Not by the coffee or the tea, or the food - but by a girl (woman). I\'m what you call a ""die hard, old school romantic"". I always have been. You can thank my Southern grandfather. And this post might not even make it to the review section. But I met the most beautiful woman here today standing in line, with an equally beautiful and engaging personality. Skin dark, brown and smooth and fine like silk. And yes, She was ""Fine"". And when she smiled it was as if there was no-one else here. Her skin and smile - flawless. She was dressed very casually. Like you would on a Saturday afternoon in the bay when your running errands. We engaged in some very small talk while in line. And for whatever reason, I was not my normal cool self. This woman had me stuttering. Yep. I was nervous. After the small talk we sat down on separate sides of the coffee shop. And I couldn\'t help but look at her and think how do I get over to her and introduce myself, after all - she was eating her meal and reading a book and I didn\'t want to intrude. SO I decided to write her a handwritten note. Yep, told you I was an old school romantic. Now, how was I going to deliver it? Well, after about 30 minutes she got up and walked by me - I said ""excuse me"". And from there I engaged her in more conversation - however, this time there was more depth to it. She is smart, witty, and maybe even appreciated my goofy nerdyness. I handed her the letter. She smiled. and she said ""I will read it later"". She could of left after that - but she didn\'t. She stayed another 5 or 10 minutes. \xa0Good sign? I guess. In the letter, I left my cell and email. Now I wait. For love? A new friend? who knows.So if I must leave a review for the Blue Danube here it is. The green tea tasted like an elixir of love. Magical. (yeah, I\'m corny too, I know). Because when I was talking to her, anything I drank here would be magical. I love the chill atmosphere because it made it easy for me to engage her in a conversation. And to top it all off today the music playlist was classic rock from the 70s!!! the soundtrack of my childhood. I\'ve been here 4 hours and I\'ve heard The Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, Carly Simon, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Boston, ya feeling me yet? All the classics! The music that got me started playing guitar and the music that I play to this day - Still, everyday. It was just incredible all the way around. These are the type of cafes I miss living in Detroit now. Cool, chill neighborhood joints. And we are across from one of San Francisco\'s Iconic restaurants. Burma Superstar. The staff here was super cool. Hey, maybe its just the ""love bug"" LOL! Cause everything about this place was what you expect from a great local coffee shop. I saw a few complaints about the WiFi and the $2 cost. I get it. We all want and expect free WiFi while sipping our lattes and green teas. I have a personal hotspot on my phone for occasions like this. Everyone doesn\'t. So thank you Blue Danube. I came here by accident today, but did I really? Is there such a thing as an accident? I met a beautiful woman here today who I may or may not ever hear from again.

UpForDayz Coffee,"[""This coffee shop is unique! Their ordering method was unlike any coffee shop I've been to. Here's how it works.

UpForDayz started roasting their own beans in the summer of love in none other than the \'Holy Land\' (Jerusalem) back in 1969; their love for coffee most definitely shows as they put lots of love into their cups of light, medium & dark roast coffee.What sets UpForDayz apart from other cafés aside from their serious machinery for brewing coffee is their warm and sincere welcome from the moment you set foot inside. They do not ask the impersonal and almost rhetorical, ""hey, how\'s it going?"" they actually say something along the lines of: ""Good morning, welcome!! How has your day been so far? To me, a few extra carefully crafted words make a world of difference!UpForDayz has a stellar staff!! Miguel is a master barista and always has a smile from ear to ear. Enrique, is super professional and always has a good recommendation in the coffee + pastry realm.I will not be forgetting the kindness of Mera, nor her broad smile of unfeigned delight. It will always be what comes to mind when I think of UpForDayz. Mera is an brilliant barista that takes the craft of coffee very seriously. As a matter of fact, everyone here is very knowledgeable about the various methods for brewing coffee. Two others that needn\'t be overlooked are Mousa & Rawan. This kick-ass duo of rock star baristas make coming back for more coffee that much easier. Their earnest and heartfelt kindness speaks volumes in my opinion. Even if their coffee sucked, (which it DOES NOT) I would still go back just to be welcomed with such a sincere and authentic attitude.UpForDayz, keep on doing what you are doing.

The outside of the coffee shop looks very colorful and inviting, however the coffee is so expensive. The ordering method is kinda cool but then once I realized I could have used my money towards a meal, it makes me cringe to come back here. As a native San Franciscan, its a very bitter coffee price to swallow. If you can afford it then do it. Otherwise, if coffee isn't the priority in your life, then just head down home and make your own cup. The coffee was also tremendously strong and I did not connect with the notes as when I would get at Philz when I am able to visit."", ""Brand new coffee house serving smoothies, sandwiches, tea and coffee.

Perhaps my favorite thing at this cafe is the matcha mochi donut which I've had everyday since discovering it.

Lately, it's been more on the dislike side. I say that is because one time I took a bite into my beef brisket and it just tasted old or rotten. Like I immediately spat it out cause it just tasted sour. Another thing I personally don't like is the meat, a lot of it is frozen. You can tell it's not fresh once so ever, so personally that's how I kinda got that taste of the old meat. What I mean by frozen, is that the meat is not thawed out, they cut it frozen still. \xa0Not to mention, the servers don't really check up on you. Sometimes have to flag another person down, which I truly dislike cause I know they didn't sit us down so it's really not their responsibility to help us. Then there some of the rude servers where they will personally cut up your meat for you outta nowhere and serve it onto your plate. I don't like that because I like my meat cooked a certain way and the last time they did this, they didn't check that one side wasn't throughly cooked. I really hate roasting a company but people gotta know the experience.I think the only thing I would say about the place that's a positive is the price is reasonable but if you go for the 2nd price which gets you more meat, definitely not worth it.

It's quiet and relaxing and peaceful, and I am focused when I come here so I always feel good when I leave because I get a lot done! The atmosphere is super chill and the music is relaxing, most of the time instrumental. It's not necessarily a place to socialize. The food is slightly overpriced but they have a good variety of food from sandwiches and salads to teas and macaroons and pastries. The restrooms are gross, that's my only complaint. There's also a YakiniQ restaurant that's next door and I think by the same owner. It's right in the middle of Japan town so the location is also superb.

From the outside, it looks pretty nondescript and like nothing special, kind-of run-down. This aesthetic continues when you walk in: there's a bunch of comfy seating but there's bad lighting and it just looks old. There was only one person working there when I walked in around 9:45am on a Tuesday morning, but lots of people were at tables and seats reading or working, so it must be a pretty good place to work. Because there was only one person taking orders at the cash register and making drinks and preparing dishes and there was a line, there was a bit of a wait for my drink. I also worked there for about 15 minutes while I finished my drink and dish.I ordered the Yuzu Honey Tea and Lemon Meringue. I just wanted the tea, but there is a $6 credit card minimum so I added a baked good to my drink order and BAM by total went up from roughly $4.50 to $12. Well okay then. The Lemon Meringue was crisp and crunchy (from the meringue), with good but not great flavor that wasn't very strong or lemony. The Yuzu Honey Tea was pricey for what you get but refreshing and flavorful. The service could've been much friendlier, but I did feel bad she was working alone and must have felt stress to work faster because there was a line of people. I will be back to try other drinks, but I'll do so with cash on me!!"", 'YankiniQ Cafe is an excellent place to get things done and has a bathroom connected to it. The drinks are pretty solid too, I had a honey citrus tea I believe during my visit.

This is the spiritual opposite of that place where young Asians epoxy themselves at tables to stare intensely at their laptop screens.

Although I was intrigued by the sweet potato latte, I went with the more predictable $4.25 Ginger & Honey Tea (photo: bit.ly/2MmEhP2).

What type of person stares you blank in the face and fails to respond when you say ""Hi"" or ""Thanks"" to them?

At least treatment was equal - they weren\'t very friendly to other patrons either. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ I\'m giving two stars for the ambiance, since it seems like a nice place to work - a good number of people were on their laptops. It looked like they were intensely studying. There were also a few couches to hang out on. If I lived nearby and needed a place to work, I\'d consider it.The food, however, was pretty disappointing. I had the sweet potato latte - which was good - but nothing unique if you\'ve had the Korean latte drink mixes before (Woori Market is around the corner - highly recommended). I wonder if they just used a drink mix and added some foam on top. I also had a slice of yuzu pound cake, which was very dry. The yuzu syrup on top was fragrant with a strong citrus punch - such a shame it didn\'t permeate the entire cake! Certainly a work in progress.

The barista asked me if I want to add expresso since there's no caffeine in the latte, I ordered one with expresso and another one without. The one without expresso has stronger taste of sweet potato and the other one is kind of interfered by the espresso. If you would like to taste more of the sweet potato, then just order the original one. If you need caffeine then definitely with expresso~ enjoy every sip :)"", ""I'm a fan of this cute little cafe nestled in Japantown. Great spot for a catch-up with friends or a working session (free wi-fi woot). The atmosphere is very cozy with cute decor, lots of seating and desks and a couch.

A couple of standouts on the drink menu:- Yuzu Palmer: tangy and refreshing with a lovely citrus flavor- Lavender latte: I got this iced and it was so good, on the sweeter side though so if you don't have a sweet tooth it may not be the drink for youI would pass on their macarons, they're nothing special in my opinion.

Matching Half Cafe,"[""LONG WAIT for food... yet its delicious. Dont go here in a hurry.

I would've given 5 stars yet the gal at the sandwich board was meticulous yet incredibly slow paced at placing of all things on the sandwiches, making it take very long. I get the meticulous part working on sandwiches is a fine art I appreciate- yet it can be done in a timely manner... pretty sure I saw her arrange a couple pieces of onions on the side salad nearly four times. Slightly borderline OCD...but what do I know I'm not a doctor yet I have worked in a Deli for years and waiting for half hour -forty five minutes didnt seem like a feasible turnover for deli food.

I got a Turkey & Jack, which had avocado and arugula on it. Their restroom is nice and the barista/cashier was easy on the eyes and very helpful. He suggested I grab a homemade pop-tart since that they make there and I didnt regret that at all since I was so hungry.

One of the best I've had. I also ordered their poptart-like pastry. Ask the staff for their recommendation and they said the one with brown sugar filling (other options were apricot and Nutella). Not worth the money at all. It looks cute, but it didn't taste like anything. Couldn't really taste the brown sugar. The only delicious thing about it was the crust. Service: All of them were just chilling. They were helpful but seems uninterested. It might be because it's two days before Thanksgiving? Back to the point, I asked them to heat up my pastry.

Eventually, she took a cookie out from a jar and walked it to the child before coming back inside (by now there were approximately 15 people in line behind me). When she got to the counter, she looked at me and said ""what?""No ""hello"". No ""good morning"". No ""what would you like to order?"" Just ""What?"" as though I was annoying her by being there. I ordered a latte and a buttered bagel, my wife ordered a latte and asked the woman whether or not she could get a bagel with avocado. The woman responded ""It\'s on the menu, you can read it"" Yes, we had the menu with us and it was confusing as to whether or not it was an option so my wife sought clarification only to receive a condescending response.I cannot remember the last time someone was so rude to us at a coffee shop, restaurant or any service industry position. It was mind blowing. It felt like she had a grudge against us for something but we had never been here before and had never seen this woman before. Beyond unacceptable way to treat customers.

Their reasoning was that it would stink up the place, which I think is such a minor reason to make a big deal out of. It was at that moment I felt unwelcome. 3. There\'s a two hour wifi limit, lol, ok. I mean the wifi already sucked. I really wanted to enjoy this place, especially the fact that it was barely 5 minutes away from campus.4.

I came a couple days before to do work; however, there was no open seating, so I\'ve tried coming here before. Both times sucked.', ""Don't be fooled by their homemade poptarts.The price for one is costly and um...do you see the raspberry filling?Yeah, neither did I. I just tasted dry crust and they said to keep eating until I got to the middle. Um, here's a picture of the middle. Where's the filling?Average coffee but disappointing poptart, but since I want to support local businesses I'll give this 3 stars instead of two."", 'Stopped by for a quick coffee on a Sunday morning.

Blue Bottle Coffee,"['I picked this place for coffee based on other reviews, and I\'m so glad I did! I was a little startled that there wasn\'t an actual shop, but the alleyway is lovely (nicest alley I\'ve ever seen!) and has places to sit. The people sipping coffee were very friendly, and I got to pet a few dogs while I was there. You can tell it\'s a popular neighborhood place.I ordered the ""oatmeal latte"" because I thought I heard someone else order that and was curious. Turns out it\'s oat *milk* which happens to be surprisingly creamy and delicious.

The line of people into the alley shows they have a solid following, and I'm joining that following.

The library has all the books I need for this project. I decided to visit Blue Bottle for a stimulating cold brew. They had some syrup and half and half for it. The cold brew was a bit expensive and typical for coffee anyway. Blue Bottle has branding and experience. This spot is just a stand and there is no seating available. It's on Linden in a distant alley that is hard to find, but I wanted some Blue Bottle. It was my first purchase. There are other Blue Bottle shops in SF(mostly in FiDi). Blue Bottle is popular expensive. It's fun!"", ""What a great place to get your quick coffee fix and explore the Hayes Valley neighborhood! It's located off the busy streets of Gough and Fell st.

If you like the strong and bitter aroma of coffee with a little hint of sweetness, this is perfect for you!"", ""I stopped here after an early morning walk on a Sunday. Finding the place was part of the adventure! It's tucked in a little side street, likely to keep it a local secret! Kind service, cool sort of industrial storefront in a warehouse.

I'd love to go back."", 'I first tried Blue Bottle Coffee at this location when I used to work nearby. I absolutely love and recommend the Nola.

Castro Coffee Company,"[""One of my favorite places for coffee. I go for the flavored drip coffee. Pot #8 rules! Always a good flavor. They have heavy-cream so it's keto friendly!

And I didn\'t have coffee here, neither did I buy ground coffee. But I had tea and a bear claw. Both were great and the service was super nice. My friend had coffee and a scone and was ecstatic. That alone should be 5-star-worthy, because he is very hard to please :-) Nice bonus point: It\'s right next to the Castro Theater and they were nice enough to let us bring our hot beverages into the cinema (because we are adults and can be trusted with handling our coffee and tea around velvet chairs)!', ""I've never gotten coffee here. Unbelievable, I know. After all, I've bought the chocolate-dipped appendage on a stick that I lustfully yet respectfully dubbed Mandingo at Hot Cookie, wolfed down the overaccessorized wieners at Dapper Dog, and attended the most essential sing-alongs at the Castro Theater. Besides, I'm a Philz guy who becomes a creature of redundant habits. But I had never been here until I found myself in the Castro early on a weekday morning with a few minutes to spare before a medical appointment up the street.What deterred me is the claustrophobic space and the number of tourists and regulars who venture in but don't seem to come out. On this particular morning, it was almost empty which allowed me to get a pleasing 20-ounce cup of the Hawaiian Royal Kona coffee for just $2.15 (photo: bit.ly/2PJ1Nsg). It gave me a gulp of the tropics before my EKG and motivated me to come back to buy a bag of their beans. They spotlighted at least five different types that morning which I presume they rotate.

I know it's a coffee shop, but I first just wanted to point out the strong scent of coffee attacks you as you walk in. Secondly, the place is very cluttered. It doesn't appear to be very organized and is a bit messy, however, the food and drink that can be purchased at Castro Coffee Company still do hit the taste buds in a positive way. There weren't as many tea options as I had expected, but nonetheless, if you don't care about anything else in this review, they make a good cup o' joe."", ""I was just walking down Castro and WHAM! The aroma of coffee smacked me right in the face! I couldn't resist a hot cuppa joe on this chilly night. So I popped into this cute tiny coffee shop jam packed with coffees and pastries. The guys that attended me were friendly and polite. I had a drip coffee ($1.62) and an apricot bar ($3.25). For drip coffee, it's self serve by the door with 8 to choose from. Refills are like a buck twenty five. Unfortunately, I didn't like anything I bought here. The coffee tasted artificial AF. (Bourbon Pecan is the one I chose). And the Apricot Bar was awful; too dense, not at all sweet...like whatsoever, tasted only of dried apricots and nothing else. Canned sodas are $1 ...so that's good cuz I was thirs tyy"", 'Great coffee place. The staff is Great!! The coffee is inexpensive and there is always a sale going on.

The people working don't make conversation but are always nice."", ""Every time I come to San Fran I always make sure to stop by here! I first came across this place a few years ago when I was having difficulty finding blended (frappe) coffee in San Fran. The shop has a lot to offer, many different types of coffees, syrups, beans, and pastries. I love their blended drinks. Tried a hot mocha once and have tried their pastries a couple times, they were good. I like how they have a little bit of seating outside. It is good to able to sit down and eat your pastry quickly especially if it is sunny. On my last trip to San Fran the smoke was making me so sick it was a blessing to be able to sit down for a bit. The people who work here are nice and are good at making sure the line doesn't back up."", ""I'm not a coffee gourmet, but I'm always giving them as gifts. \xa0I didn't want to buy stale old gourmet coffee for high prices at safeway, so I came here asking for strong but great tasting coffee and the owners were very helpful & knowledgeable- their coffee choice even impressed me along with their spinach cheese empanada!!! Their shop is tiny with only 3 small tables outside so intend to buy your coffee and pastries to drink as TAKEOUT. \xa0But once you know the coffee you like - mine was the Barbary Coast Reserve 1 pound ground for $12- then you can just go in and out and enjoy it at home or work!! \xa0They also have their website you can google where you can order the coffee to be shipped to you if you already know what you want so no having to leave home!!I'd definitely come back!!"", 'I love this place.

I love that there\'s a huge selection of coffee pumps and that they change daily so you can really sample all the wonderful variety of roasts and blends this place carries. I personally prefer a medium or light roast so I get more caffeine to balance my heavy cream. There\'s always at least two choices, one Latin American and one usually African. I gravitate to Tanzanian and Costa Rican coffees and YES the coffee matters even though I drink it with heavy cream and brown sugar!', 'OMG. \xa0I was in here recently and got the coconut coffee Frappe.

So if it's a weekday, or \xa0weekend evening consider getting here some way that does not involve driving or be prepared for a quarter mile park and walk. If it helps there is both a muni station and the a street car stop not quite a block away.There are three or so patio style metal table/chair combos outside if you feel like having your coffee on site, but there is no inside seating and overall this is more of a walk in/walk out kinda place.Decor is what I'd describe as San Francisco utilitarian. The building itself has been here forever (it used to be the Castro Cheesery-but even under that name it was till a coffee place.) and has that settled well used look. The counter is dominated by every kind of coffee the world has to offer in bulk glass displays. While there is also an extensive selection of teas to chose from there are more then a hundred different types of coffee bean in stock. That's all pretty awesome but there's more. The baristas on deck have some mad coffee skills. This is easily one of the best espresso spots anywhere. The manager (who may also be the owner) on scene is turkish and well, he's forgotten more about what makes a great pull then most mortals ever know. If espresso is not your thing this place also puts out godlike latte's \xa0cappuccinos and the like. As you might expect there is nothing wrong with the basic coffee's either and at 2.50 for a meduim-ish it's the total bargain choice.But wait there's yet more awesome goodness here-the pastry counter. When you get up to the cashier section to pay for your drink and some beans (Hey, you're in line anyway. Why not?) there is amazingly tempting treats in a display case. If you need something more breakfasty then the mouth pleasing petit fours/truffles/things covered with sugar and oozing cream/almond paste/marzipan/whatever the croissants are the way to go as the bagels and burritos are just ordinary. Not bad mind you, but not anything to come just for either. Avoid the malt balls though-nobody orders those really and the ones on display have been there a while.So while this is not the best spot to break out the laptop and pretend to work while secretly checking everyone out, this is one of the best high quality, local, quirky coffee spots in a city filled with excellent quirky coffee spots."", ""No over the top here fancy words here, just a great cup of joe that comes at a great price compared to other coffee shops in Castro. \xa0The shop is so small, but they've got your standard drinks. \xa0They also sell coffee beans too if you need some for home. \xa0I ended up with a latte which tasted great, no sugar necessary and not too bitter. \xa0Great stuff."", ""Exceptionally good coffee, exceptional price. Many whole bean options (I grind fresh at home each day), and REAL authentic light roasts. If you are a real fan of light only, you know how medium is often passed off as light. These beans here are visible and on display when you choose. Most prices are in the low to mid teens per pound, for a real, actual 16 ounce pound. Whereas other high end roasts are 10-12 ounces, and are priced anywhere from $16 to over $20....If you have a cup of brew from the store, it is not an individual pour over made for you, it's from a pump canister. THAT SAID (because you know this could be not so great, in all reality), yesterday I went in for the 1st time ever, at 3:30 pm, when you'd *expect* that to be less than fresh. I pumped out the VERY LAST cup and it absolutely tasted just minutes old. REALLY GREAT COFFEE. Meaning that, at that late hour, they obviously turn over the product too fast for it to sit long. Also, that cup of amazing coffee was only $1.65 for a small.EXTREME BONUS: among the cream options is heavy cream. I can't really do coffee with half and half-it's just not the same.

You come here for coffee and it is pretty evident once you set in. For some reason, a hand made cup of coffee caught my eye and unbeknownst to me, you have to pick the coffee to use. Say what!? I don't know where to begin with this...The gentleman behind the counter quickly sensed my confusion and shock and began to ask me what I liked and enjoyed and proceeded to make a recommendation which didn't fail. It was one of the best cups of coffee I ever had. No need for milk or sugar. Just one of the best cups.There is a small selection of pastries and while they weren't the most amazing bites I ever had, but it doesn't disappoint.Prices are pretty reasonable and in my short time at the shop, it seems to be that quick grab and go spot that the locals hit up to grab their coffee before making their way on their daily routines.Would I go back? Sure. It was one of the best cups I ever had."", 'We now order the beans directly from the cafe. Even with shipping, it still works out to be cheaper than buying in Starbucks or our local roasters.

Central Coffee Tea & Spice,"[""I just moved to the NOPA neighborhood and have been sneaking around the area to test the cafe's, and this one is a gem! Their building blends right into the character of the neighborhood, and once inside it's super cozy with a rustic bohemian vibe. There's a lot of the menu I haven't tried yet, but their pastries are delicious and I think my favorite drink so far is the iced latte with oat milk -- very creamy, well-brewed espresso, and the roast is not too acidic or smokey. Baristas are super friendly and attentive, and maybe it's packed during certain hours but in the middle of the day on a Wednesday it's not crammed with laptopers like a lot of the places on Divisadero. Not sure if it's dog friendly yet, but they have a small outside sitting area as well and the park is only a short walk away.

Macchiato is pure magic, and my standard drink (soy latte extra hot extra shot) is reliably balanced and generally mind-blowing. Even their ""brewed and ready"" drip coffee is good!

A lot of people come and go in the morning, so sometimes you have to wait for a seat. Because it's not a large space, crowd is more quiet. The lighting, color, furniture, tile, etc.. give you a warm and special feeling and their design theme continues in other stores like the one on Divisadero.

She yelled for us to get the second coffee at the counter when I noticed her co-worker dropped off food and beverages he took orders for to tables.

I'm not sure how this owner screens his applicants but bravo because every individual who works here has such a kind calm soul.Thank you Richfield for keeping me caffeinated and happy."", 'Super sad/disappointing - they have DISCONTINUED the ricotta toast. (they said they were replacing it with something soon.Service was painfully slow. looks like the avocado is smashed to order - which maybe I would enjoy - but since they get an order for it every other customer - maybe make a batch for 15 toasts, then start again - it would still be super fresh - but faster.We ordered the avocado toast and the breakfast sandwich (it was light on bacon - maybe 1.5 slices), a chai and a mocha. It was about $25. we left hungry.The water glasses could be used as thimbles - seriously I have never seen smaller glasses.', ""The Richfield is a great local coffee shop with a good amount of outdoor seating to relax at! \xa0I've gotten the cold brew ($4.50) a couple of times and it tasted a bit lighter than what I'm used to getting at other places, but it was still smooth and pretty good. \xa0Something I super appreciate and love about this place is that they serve their cold brew with coffee ice cubes so your drink doesn't get watered down! \xa0It's such a small and easy thing to do, but I've never seen any other place do this before. \xa0It really shows that they care about their product and it shows they care about their customers' satisfaction.The couple of times I've been here, the toast has been sold out unfortunately. \xa0I usually come later in the afternoon, so I'll be sure to make a visit earlier in the day sometime to try those out! \xa0Definitely recommend a visit if you're ever in the area."", 'Spic and span, simple but delicious coffee inspired by a Chicago Boxing Match; unfortunately the first time Ali was defeated. Historic news clips and some memorabilia spot the walls, and some mellow hip hop playing this afternoon. Close to the laundromat. Grab a latte to sip and pass the time!', ""I was in the area and wanted a coffee and stumbled upon this place. The Richfield is a small little coffee shop in the Inner Richmond district. There are a few tables inside and outside, and they offer free WiFi. There is a nice vibe here, I saw a couple people chilling and some doing work! I looked at the menu and ordered the Cold Brew. The Cold Brew was good, smooth and not too bitter. It came with coffee ice cubes, a very nice touch to keep the ice from diluting the drink.I came on a weekday afternoon and found street parking fairly easily. The staff was nice and friendly. Convenient neighborhood coffee shop to visit if you're ever in the area!"", ""Definitely a good spot if you have a minute to relax or even on the go, The Richfield has you covered.

The service is always on point. The guys here are always attentive ready to serve and help.

And when I say little.... like tinyyyy. Super friendly people. Good coffee too, I tend to be pretty picky and they have my approval. Also avocado toast.... no need to say more. I wish I lived nearby to walk to this place each morning.', ""Love this place! Coffee is great and service is consistently friendly. Place is tiny, but that doesn't mean there's no atmosphere. It's casual here and I love the green walls. Parking is not easy if you're not in the neighborhood already. Came here recently on a Saturday morning and there were families, groups, individuals, everyone in the neighborhood basically coming over to Richfield. I'm assuming you will be next! I ordered a latte and banana bread. Everything came out to $8 total. Delicious everything!"", ""What a cute little coffee shop! It's pretty easy to miss as it's in a funny triangle at California and 5th. This is what good coffee should taste like.After living in Australia for a number of years I'm always on the lookout for a real Aussie style flat white and this did not disappoint. Exactly the right size and the espresso was smooth and perfect. I was only visiting SFO for a couple of days and made sure to come back 2 mornings in a row to get my FW. I found them on Yelp and they definitely earn the great reviews."", 'I have been to many coffeehouse while traveling and few of them make a quality cup of coffee. \xa0Richfield does not disappoint. \xa0Our group had lattes, a flat white, and an Americano. \xa0All of these had the correct ratio of milk to espresso, or water to espresso, along with correctly pulled shots. The baristas obviously love coffee and put that love into each cup.', 'Brekkie Sandwich - lives up to the hype. \xa0Simple ingredients, but delicious.Cold Brew - they use ice cubes made with coffee to keep the brew from tasting watered down as you savor every sip. \xa0So novel and simple that not even the big coffee chains do it. \xa0Props to The Richfield on that.Seating - they promptly opened at 7:30 and I got one of the few seats inside. \xa0Enjoyed a good book while eating and drinking. \xa0Small interior, but very relaxing.Will try their Avocado Toast and a hot brew next time...', 'Have you even gone to a coffee shop and asked ""May I get a cup of coffee"" and received the snooty response ""well, this IS a coffee shop.""? \xa0I have a couple of times over the years and don\'t really appreciate the sarcasm, particularly when I still haven\'t had my morning cup. \xa0And while I haven\'t been given this response at The Richfield, I feel like they want to say that. \xa0If you ask for a cappuccino or latte with non-fat milk (as my SO often does) you are at the very least told that they don\'t have non-fat, but might be told the additional detail that non-fat milk doesn\'t make quite a proper type of foam. \xa0Don\'t get me wrong, we like the Richfield food and coffee and enjoy the boxing theme and old copies of The Ring magazine to browse. \xa0And the location is sort of cool - what for years was a wedge shaped island off of California is now a small 2 story building with The Richfield in the lower floor.The breakfast items are tasty and well made, the coffee drinks are good (though I have a couple other preferences in SF). \xa0So we stop in when we are in the area and in need of a bite or coffee. \xa0Prices are a touch high, but not out of line. \xa0They don\'t seem big on substitutions, and if you want almond milk be prepared to fork over another $0.75 for your drink. \xa0And ask for Earl Grey tea (the preference of my SO) and they may look down on you as being too pedestrian (which is funny because there is no parking in the area so only pedestrians can get there).It just seems that they have a bit of an attitude - maybe it\'s the boxing décor that brings it out in them. \xa0Hopefully it won\'t turn people off from going there - though there is a bit of competition in the area with Beanstalk, Blue Danube, and Cumaica all within a block or three. \xa0I expect a bit of attitude in the Marina or SOMA, but not in Inner Richmond.So 5 stars for the food and boxing theme, 4 for the location and coffee, 3 for the limited tea selection and perceived attitude. \xa0A 4 star review.', ""I love this tiny coffee shop in the median of an intersection. It's a cute neighborhood spot to pop in for a coffee or a snack.I just get whatever latte or ice coffee drink that I'm feeling that day, and (if I'm lucky), snag a seat at one of the 3 tiny, 2-3 person tables they have. When the weather is nice, sometimes there are 2, 2-seater tables outside.They also have a little counter that I've seen some people stand at to do work. I personally don't find the environment conducive to working, but it's fun to people watch and read a little on a slow day. I also tend to prefer small cozy coffee shops to large ones.The service is friendly, the drinks are pretty average (though they have a few interesting selections and a large variety of tea), and the food is pretty unique. I think the breakfast sandwich is popular (but not a stunner, according to my NYC-breakfast-sandwhich-loving friend). I have also tried the sesame ricotta toast topped with strawberries, coconut flakes, and honey. It's an interesting combination, and I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure if it completely worked. Maybe in strawberry season, when the strawberries are a little more naturally sweet, it would make sense.Almond milk is extra and they will remind you like Chipotle employees remind you that guac is extra."", ""I don't write many of these but I had to write about my experience at the Richfield. As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a friendly smile and my order was taken right away. The place is tiny but has a comfy atmosphere. When my latte was ready it was brought out to me with another friendly greeting. Everyone here (employees and customers) seem comfortable and pleasant. The drink itself was excellent and the milk was super foamy. The almond croissant I got was also very good. There's also some outdoor seating to enjoy the weather when it's nice. Not a great place for working but if you just need a good drink and a place to read/hang out this place should be considered."", ""Great for a quick brunch or coffee on the go! My beau and I grabbed two brekkie sandwiches and a couple of coffees to-go, but ended up eating outside when a table opened up.

But what takes The Richfield above and beyond is their unique and delicious food menu. I was obsessed with the black sesame ricotta toast topped with fresh strawberries and coconut. I've never seen this combo anywhere else but as soon as I spotted it on the menu it was a where-have-you-been-all-my-life type of moment! Though it's teeny with just a few small tables, it's a great addition to this neighborhood and I'm jealous of people who live in the area and can stop by on the regular. I'll definitely be back on my next trip to SF!"", 'Super cute small coffee spot! The workers are very knowledgeable and helpful with the menu. they answered all my questions and helped me choose what to order. Not very much seating, but they have a counter to stand at as well as the several small tables. Would return!', ""3 stars because very few people like ice chunks in their ice cream.Got the affogato with the caramel ice cream and it had lots of ice crystals in it. Maybe I'm the only one ordering ice cream so the ice cream is old and cold and frozen over like Hell.The coffee shot on top was okay. A little bitter but overall not worth the $5 I paid.$4.50 plus 50¢ tip.Their coffee is on the strong side which isn't my particular taste. I'm more of a medium flavored coffee drinker. So overall 3 stars.""]"
Verve Coffee Roasters,"[""I've walked by this place many times and never walked in until today, and I'm really glad I did! I walked in on a whim and was immediately greeted by the friendly baristas behind the counter, the immediate service was really nice too!I ordered the Jasmine Oolong Tea For Here and it came out a few minutes after I ordered in a cute tea cup with a little pitcher of the rest of my hot tea. The set up was so cute and it only cost $5! Their big windows are perfect to enjoy the late afternoon sun. There is a little sugar station where you can add what you want to your tea and coffee, but when it comes to my hot tea I like it just the way it is! The little blue seating area that doesn't have any booths or set tables has a very cute community vibe to it and I enjoyed sitting there just enjoying the sun with others"", ""I'm a huge fan of Verve Coffee in Santa Cruz. Unfortunately, this location isn't at all the style I liked at the original location. First, seating is limited, and you can't lean backwards on any of the cushions near the windows without stressing your back. Second, some of the pricing is misleading. Santa Cruz offers you different prices for different sizes but here, the menu at the counter only displays one price for certain items--the larger and more costly size. I'm sorry to say I won't be returning and will instead drive to Santa Cruz. (April 2019)"", ""Ahhhh the epitome of the hipster cafe with minimal space where you're forced to either uncomfortably stand with a sliver of table to work or cuddle with the stranger next to you as you share the only table in the entire space. My favorite! Other than that, love the vibe haha. But really there's not a lot of space and you really have to wait for a spot or just idk leave? I didn't try their coffee as I was all caffeinated for the day. I definitely will be back though! I love this area and it's right near Dolores Park. I would just recommend you come early to snag a spot or come superrrr late like when they're closing lol.OK UPDATE: I totally lovedddd spending my afternoon here. I applied to what seemed like all the jobs listed in the Bay Area and read Michelle Obama's new book! A+! The place starts to clear out around 5pm so if you're looking for a spot then without waiting, that'd be the time!"", ""Great place located at the corner of Market and Church.

There is also a bathroom for what happens after drinking coffee ;)I had a cappuccino with hemp milk (they don't have oat milk here), and my boyfriend had the one&one which is basically a machiatto with an extra shot of espresso. Will definitely be back."", ""Love this place for doing work, reading a book or just catching up with friends. First off, it's one of the few places that has oat milk as the option. Second, their food options are great! I had the biscuit with a poached egg and my friend got the avocado toast, and both tasted amazing. Pro tip: grab a corner seat and curl up on a rainy day!"", ""I'm not a coffee drinker at all, but needed something to wake me up on my morning walk. The space is aesthetically pleasing with a lot of natural light, which freshens up the setting. They have plenty of plants instilled around the sleek countertops --very neat space and design. I just had a cup of Chai with Almond Milk ($4.25) to-go and was on my way.This isn't the best place to study or work though as there isn't too much space though. On the other hand, great to people watching as it's situated on a corner with floor to ceiling glass windows all around."", ""A cozy little coffee shop to get some work done! We came here on Black Friday after hopelessly calling a bunch of coffee shops in SF looking for something that's open. It is a small spot close to Whole Foods/Safeway on Market. You can either sit at a table or one of the couches (tables were taken when we came at ~ 10:30 am). They have both WiFi and an xfinity hotspot so you're covered! I haven't seen any outlasts though :/The design is a combination of old brick and wood. It reminds me of New England more than anything. I love the amount of natural light offered by huge windows. Definitely bringing a book next time!We got a latte, a chai, and two cookies. The drinks were good quality even though a little pricey. I found the chocolate cookie a bit overwhelming, but the poppyseed one was great! The avocado toast ($9) was actually very delicious and bigger than what you'd get for the price at most places. Overall, the ambiance is what really seals the deal for Verve. It's perfect to work or read a book on a rainy day!"", ""Verve Coffee Roasters is a small, minimal space that offers your typical coffee options as well as some nice light food choices. My boyfriend and I stopped here one morning during our visit to SF to fuel up for the day. I ordered a latte and a piece of quiche, and he got a pour over and the daily toast, which had ricotta and plenty of greens. The guy at the counter was super friendly, helpful, and patient, which was\xa0refreshing as I find sometimes the customer service at places like this can be lacking. The pour over came with a little card that includes the variety's flavor profile notes, cup characteristics, producer, region, process, and cultivar. I'm not a coffee snob by any means but I still thought this was cool. The latte was your typical latte, creamy and delicious. My personal favorite part of our visit was the quiche. When I ordered, I was informed that the slices are served at room temp and asked if that was okay, which I really appreciated. The quiche was so intensely creamy and rich that it almost felt more like a dessert, which sounds weird but it was packed with flavor from the salty bacon and so decadent. Definitely not an every day option for me but a nice vacation treat. The daily toast was just okay, not a whole lot of flavor and I thought it could have used more seasoning. Overall I enjoyed our stop at Verve and would go back in the future, or if I lived nearby."", ""Literally the most poorly run coffeeshop in SF. Spend your money anywhere else. You'd probably get a nicer barista at a gas station."", 'I have walked by Verve Coffee many times. I decided to visit today and try something. It\'s a different cafe with its own concept. It\'s minimal, but there\'s some different coffee drinks. I saw Americano and espresso, and that didn\'t appeal to me. I saw something called ""One and One"" and thought I would try it. It was an espresso shot and a macchiato shot. The macchiato shot was creamy and a small shot of coffee. The espresso was very sour and you had to drink it fast. This cafe is modern and comfortable to hang out in. Compare it to Philz, which gets on my nerves. My drink was $4. I wonder if I will be caffeinated for the rest of the day.', 'Their bowl of soul is my all time favorite!!! I recommend it with the English Breakfast tea. The shop itself is also very cozy and lovely - a great place for working / studying / meeting with friends.', 'You might not think of this place for tea, but you should !!!

I was so excited that they opened shop in SF after having only been able to have it through third party shops and when I visit LA. The space is gorgeous (convenient to get to via public transport) and the drinks were solid. Price is typical for California.

Note, this location is NOT idea for studying/working for the many reasons below:No accessible outlets throughout - just in one locationSeating is very very sparse throughout the day but very cozy corners in the back and plenty of standing spotsFree wifi but how will you use it when you can\'t really sit anywhere?Baristas are friendly but when I went, getting a cup of water after the initial order was hard (not sure if they usually have a water station)-1 star for the store itself - I wish they were much much bigger with much more space to even sit down and chat with a friend - but a full 5 for the drinks :)', ""If I'm not mistaken - and I often am - this is Verve's only retail presence in the city, and it's a prominent spot at the much traversed corner of Market and Church. Most of their cafes are in Santa Cruz, where co-founders Ryan O'Donovan and Colby Barr base their operations, and Tokyo of all places, where I think I saw one of their cafes in Shinjuku. In other words, they may be Blue Bottling toward Starbucks territory but there was no evidence of racial profiling yet at the Castro location. Just more of a preference for them to serve the local hipster populace from what I could tell from their droning chatter.I suppose I should have gone for one of their coffee specialties since they appeared to have all the shiny hardware necessary to prepare them (photo: bit.ly/2JkpKSO). However, I was in the mood for tea on a blustery day when I was a bit on the forlorn side. I went for a $4 cup of their Rooibos which was advertised as having elements of caramel and nectar and being 'bodied' whatever that means. I waited patiently for the barista to prepare it from a jar of loose leaves, and the result was smooth and, well, 'bodied' (photo: bit.ly/2Hl167X). There is seating in here, but good luck with that as the laptoppers lay siege to the space. In response, I was off on my merry way.TEA - 4 stars...a particularly smooth Rooibos can be sipped hereAMBIANCE - 3 stars...ah, to be young and self-entitledSERVICE - 3 stars...tersely pleasantTOTAL - 4 stars...probably helps to express some nerve at Verve"", ""I consistently have a great experience here. The service is outstanding. Friendly yet unpretentious. The vibe is local with a mix of friends meeting friends, first dates, people working, and people getting a quick drink.

Not a crazy amount of seating but does include a small communal table and benches and low tables, allowing the coffee culture to shine. It's really a unique space.I went for a Gibraltar, which is espresso plus a splash of warm milk. (It's like a mini latte!) A bit pricey but definitely satisfying and delicious. The barista offered to add more milk orvchange the temperature of milk if we wanted.

The Coffee Movement,"[""Wonderful little coffee shop. It's normally staffed with just one really awesome and kind barista at a time, so be patient and expect good coffee.

Keep on dishing out great coffee.-"", ""I'm writing this 5mins after I left. I stumbled to this place as I was walking around Chinatown, reminiscing childhood memories. I've never thought a coffee shop like this would exist so close to a place I cherish a lot. The ambiance definitely caught my eye. The decor was spot on- very simple, elegant, and peaceful. This place is not your sit down coffee shop, it's more of a stop and go place. There are no chairs inside and it's a bit small. The menu consist of various unique coffee and tea. I went with the vanilla spice latte, and it was very delicious. The cable car runs through from time to time to really give you that full San Francisco experience. \xa0I'm slightly bias with The Coffee Movement as not only did I enjoyed the good coffee, but the awesome childhood memories it brought back."", ""Such a great find!

If I had to model my future kitchen area, I would use this shop as inspiration. It's minimal, no-nonsense, and really puts the focus on the coffee and how it's being made. I'd go as far as to say that the all-white interior was so that the coffee could provide the colour. I've been here twice, having ordered a cappuccino and a latte. Both times, I was in awe at how much grace and passion went into making my cup. The attention to detail in providing an experience was evident, as I also was passed a lid on a small saucer. Talk about making me feel special.Both coffees were ready to drink, at the right temperature right away. I couldn't taste any hints of the espresso being burnt, and it tasted oh-so-smooth. I knew I couldn't get my coffee from anywhere else now.

It didn't have any acidic bitterness to it and was incredibly smooth (and caffeinated). The space itself is pretty small and minimalistic, which lends itself well to the modern coffeeshop aesthetic.

Can't wait to come back whenever we're in the neighborhood."", ""Top notch coffee in a convenient location right on the Cable Car line. I ordered a cocoa cappuccino with their in-house made vanilla spice. It was DEE-LISH-US. Served at the perfect temperature with better than ideal flavor. It tastes like a warm, welcoming hug. The baristas are incredibly friendly. Some coffee shops come off a little pretentious, but didn't feel that here one bit! They made the perfect recommendations for what I was in the mood for. In addition to phenomenal coffee and warm, cool vibes, The Coffee Movement also offers fresh pastries. Overall experience was fantastic and I look forward to seeing this shop thrive!"", ""It's great to have a coffee shop in the neighborhood, even better when it is one that has a focus on providing such a high level of quality. It also helps that the owners Brian and Reef are very friendly, and are willing to answer questions and explain the differences between the various types of beans, not giving off the pretentious vibe that is often associated with quality coffee shops around SF. While a small space, they have done a great job making it seem bright and open, with a couple of high top tables to relax and drink. They have pastries from Jane Bakery available as well, which are some of the best pastries around. Finally, the price points are amazing, with cups of coffee in the $3-4 range, well below other spots around town. If you live in the neighborhood or walk past on the way to work, these guys should become part of your routine, and if you are swinging by on the cable car, they are worth the stop and they represent SF well."", 'Gorgeous, super chic little coffee shop. Got the vanilla latte and cocoa cappuccino - both were amazing. Friendly and super knowledgeable baristas. Excellent customer service.Best coffee in town!', 'Great coffee! Thank you to Brian for his hospitality. Highly recommend the cafe tonic with the Yukro from Madcap.', ""BEST COFFEE IN THE CITY BY ONE OF THE TOP BARISTAS IN THE WORLDReef, one of the two owners of this place, was crowned the top barista in the USA and second in the world competition. Bryan, the other \xa0partner and co-founder, will talk your ear off and make sure that you leave with a smile on your face.The coffee is some of the smoothest and full in the city.

I can't wait to get my caffeine buzz on here for the years to come!"", 'Welcoming, 5-star baristas!High quality coffee, beautiful aesthetic and taste. We enjoyed the latte and cocoa cappaccino.

Black Sugar,"[""Good boba is few and far between on my little island, so I always try to get my fix while traveling. \xa0The brightly colored instagram worthy photos at Black Sugar caught my eye and piqued my interest. \xa0After scrolling through the photos, they had me at mango matcha latte. \xa0I love the strawberry matcha boba from another popular joint up the street, so this was right up my alley. \xa0Much like their shop, they have a small, but sufficient menu that includes choices of milk teak, fruit tea, fresh milk, matcha, & coffee. \xa0Their favorite flavors are on the left and you have the option to choose the level of sweetness for your drink. \xa0Skimping on sweetness is pretty much blasphemy for me, so you know 100% sweet all the way! \xa0They even have liquid cane syrup available for that extra sugar overload.Being a lover of all things mango, I went with the mango matcha latte of course and tried it without mixing it first just to see. \xa0Got a straight shot of that sweet boba goodness and it was yuuuumm! \xa0They were the perfect consistency, chewy and not overcooked. \xa0I mixed it up as instructed and wow, I am a fan! \xa0I loved that mango flavor which seemed thicker than the matcha layer (or it could've been the boba syrup?) and it was just divine. My friend & I loved it so much we went back for a second round of drinks before catching our flight! \xa0The second time, I got it extra sweet, and yep, good decision. \xa0Can't have too much sugar. \xa0Ever.So, if you're staying in the Union Square area & love boba, GO NOW. \xa0This shop is easily accessible and there's no line. \xa0Don't blink though or you may miss it! \xa0It's tiny with room to seat only four patrons, but definitely worth the stop."", 'Whaaat, this place is different from the typical boba places that I have been to. They have different flavors that I would have never thought of doing plus a few standard ones.First time here, I tried the matcha sesame latte. It had the perfect blend of all the ingredients. Forwarding on this drink... you will get sesame in your teeth, so be sure to have some floss.. lol. The boba is cooked perfectly and has a slight sweetness to it. With this being said, I thought it gave the perfect sweetness to my drink (I requested no sugar) This has by far been my favorite drink in San Fran.Second time I came, I tried the mango matcha latte. It was very pretty and flavorful, yet I still loved the matcha sesame better. Other flavors I tried were pear green tea and the lychee green tea. The pear tea was sooooo good! The lychee was also a nice refreshing drink and has pieces of lychee in it.Now, I will try and find a place in my home town that serves up drinks this delicious and creative!', ""The Mango Matcha Latte reminded me of a variation of the Strawberry Matcha latte at Boba Guys. \xa0I ordered the Mango Matcha Latte at 70% sweetness with boba. \xa0At first sip, you could taste a good mix of the mango and matcha, neither being too overpowering. \xa0The boba however stood out to me as it seemed to be sweeter than the actual drink. \xa0The boba was quite firm but not too soft. \xa0The cup that the drink came in was cute and something that could possibly be reused. \xa0 The service was quick and prompt. \xa0I came in on a Tuesday afternoon so it wasn't too busy. \xa0I would suggest this place if you're looking for somewhere to sit for a while as they only have about 4 stools available. \xa0Overall, I would suggest this place if you're in the area or if you're like me and you're always seeing pictures on Instagram of this place! \xa0Definitely worth a try!"", ""Cold brew matcha latte and roasted oolong are delicious. Fruity teas are great as well. This place has good drinks, but be warned it's tiny. If you need a place to sit and chill you can always pop into the Hilton across the street."", 'So f\'ing good the first time - five stars. The second time was not as good - four stars.I\'m conflicted because the first black sugar fresh milk with pearls/boba $4.45 was so damn good. The black sugar fresh milk tasted almost exactly like an ice caramel macchiato, which I miss since I can\'t have caffeine anymore. The boba texture was perfect. Bouncy and not too soft lol.The second time I visited, the flavor of the ""black sugar"" burnt sugar was weaker. The pearls were just as good as before. Both times we had about a ten minute wait after ordering because they were making the pearls. The freshness of their small-batch pearl preparation must be the key to the excellent texture. The taro milk with almond milk $4.95 is also a good option. They can\'t adjust the sweetness level because the taro and sugar is already pre-mixed, but not to worry - \xa0it\'s not too sweet. The tall guy at the cash register has good customer service skills. I noticed he is careful to tell customers special instructions. It\'s still one of the top places for boba in the city for me even though I actually don\'t drink milk tea. I don\'t know how anybody finds parking around here. We take public transportation or a lyft to the mall/union square for shopping and then come here afterwards. There\'s an expensive parking garage next door. They only have four or so seats inside. Halal Guys is next door which is convenient in case you want to order some food to-go while you\'re waiting for the boba to be prepared.*I was wrong about a charge for almond milk. Management let me know that it\'s actually no extra charge for it. Thank you!They haven\'t addressed the plastic and/or recycling issue though. The thick plastic cups seem kind of wasteful especially since most people don\'t recycle them and the shop doesn\'t seem to recycle them either. The cups have survived my dishwasher and I\'ve reused them multiple times - bpa be damned.', ""Finally got the chance to come visit Black Sugar. We arrived on a Sunday morning a few minutes before it opened and there was already a couple waiting in front of us. Soon after, more people were gathered in line. I ordered the Taro matcha latte with boba (subbed almond milk). This drink comes with a non-customizable sweetness level but I did not think it was too sweet. I really appreciated that you can sub almond milk without an extra charge. They use real taro but it was smooth, not gritty. It added a thickness to the drink. Make sure to thoroughly mix your drink, which the cashier advised. The boba was a good chewiness and added a bit more sweetness to the drink. The matcha was very aromatic. i tried my fiance's black sesame milk and that was also really good. The black sesame was not too gritty when swallowed, like some places make it. Will try the black sugar fresh milk next time! Although the drink is on the pricier side, especially because it's like a 16oz size, I think you're getting a pretty high quality drink that tastes great. Only three or four seats along the window inside, so this is really a pick up and go type of shop."", ""Yay work friends! My work friend had been away for a while but finally made it back into SF, so a celebratory drink was in order. He's a bubble tea fan, so he'd had this place scoped out.I got the matcha taro latte (I am quite susceptible to Yelp peer pressure, then always insta-regret it). Like all other boba shops, you can customize the sweetness (usually, although not on the matcha taro latte) and the ice. The regular sweetness was actually not super sweet, though I almost prefer my teas to be slightly bitter.The drink was aesthetically pleasing, with the light green matcha atop the silky purple taro. The taro was well pulverized into a powdery form, lightly sweetened, but didn't really stand out in any way (e.g., super taro-y). The matcha felt a bit powdery in my mouth (maybe the taro got into it somehow?). It didn't taste like the low-quality powder mix some spots use for matcha, but it also lacked the deep richness I crave in matcha. The outside of the boba was slick, and the inside also had that slickness mixed with the chewiness. Boba is lightly sweetened, but I always think that the sweeter the boba, the better (omg honey drenched boba). Not watered down.The shop itself is pretty small, just a counter for ordering and 4 bar stools by the window. Clean, simple white and wood aesthetic like many modernly designed shops these days. There was a line 10 deep at 1:30pm on Wednesday.Overall, drink was a nice after lunch pick-me-up, but I don't think I'd walk out of my way for it. Maybe I should try the namesake next time! 3.5/5 overall"", ""One of the best boba places in SF (and at a much lower price point than most as well). Cheaper than boba guys, same quality matcha. Milk substitutions are free too!Black sesame matcha is my favorite so far, their milk drinks and house milk tea are great too. Service is quick and friendly - stop by if you're in the area!Other pros: close to the mall/union square, and Kin Khao"", ""One of the best boba places I've tried in SF hands down. This place may seem like an unassuming hole-in-the-wall, but boy are they a boba powerhouse. We ordered the matcha mango latte with 70% sweetness, and we received our drink in less than 5 minutes after ordering it. Although the drink itself was still very sweet (a bit too much for my liking), I really enjoyed the creaminess and richness of the milk. The balance between the mango and matcha was truly harmonious, and the flavors itself were pretty subtle. The pearls were amazing - the perfect bouncy texture and size, and nicely sweetened. I would love to come back and try their tea-flavored drinks. Come here if you want unique, high quality boba."", ""BLACK SUGAR FRESH MILK FTW!!! I was so excited to visit this place because of all the good things that my friends have been telling me. I came here on a Thursday afternoon around 4 PM and the place had a line already. The line does not seem too bad and moved pretty quickly. I waited for about 5 minutes with 10 people ahead of me and when I go to the cashier, the girl who helped me was very nice and explained to me how there are certain drinks on the menu cannot be adjusted (sugar level). I opted in for one of their top favorites - Black Sugar Fresh Milk with boba. The boba shop is not too big but it is big enough for a couple high chairs where you can sit and wait for your drinks to be made or have a quick chat. Anyways- the drinks did not take too long to make and when I got my drink I couldn't help but Instagram it with the cute little lucky cat wall that they have outside the boba shop. The drink was really good and the texture of the boba was cooked just right. Pricing is not outrageous either for it being in SF. I am glad that they opened it in a walking distance from Union Square/ DTSF. I saw alot of people ordered their Mango Matcha Latte with boba and that looked really IG worthy as well. Next time, I will definitely come back and check out their other drinks!"", ""Black Sugar are known for their Milk Teas like Latte & Matcha. My friend got the Milk Tea was perfectly sweeten and the boba was chewy and I also got the Lychee Peach with Lychee Jelly. It tastes similar to Pit Stop Boba at Westborough because they use real Lychee! They don't use plastic cups, they use a higher quality cup for matchas and latte. With a simple cute logo. The place is simple and not that big. Limited seating. Staff was super friendly! The guy at the cashier always ask customers how their drinks are! But it's a good grab to go boba stop."", ""Solid boba shop in the Powell/Tenderloin area. I ordered the Taro Matcha Latte with Califia Almond Milk and it was very creamy and flavorful. Not too sweet! I tried my friends drink and it was a little sweet for the both of us. They kindly offered to adjust the sweetness level :) The boba was a tad too soft at first but the cool drink cooled/hardened it in a few minutes. I wouldn't go out of my way to go to Black Sugar but if I was in the area and was craving milk tea or a matcha latte, I'd go back. Service is friendly and quick. Check it out!"", 'My first time in San Fran... nice city but where the heck are all my boba places?!?! Where the Asians at? \xa0The fug?!?! After walking for what seemed like 10 miles... those dang hills! Finally tracked down this boba place - The ONLY boba place that\'s offering my #brownsugarbobamilk and boy was I disappointed. Cute shop, tiny, 4 bar stools... order & go. \xa0Service was OK, not sure why no one was manning the counter - until the girl saw me waiting, then a guy popped out from the back and took my order. My drink takes no time to make - if you\'ve had it, you\'ll know. \xa0Took a quick 2 mins and got my drink. Here they call it ""Black Sugar Milk""... welp, the boba is not as soft as others I\'ve had, puts WAAAYYY too much ice - making the balance of brown sugar boba vs. milk like 50% milk - 20% boba - 30% ice; so gone in 60 seconds. \xa0Tsk Tsk. \xa0This is what I\'d call ""desperately seeking brown sugar boba"" and I was, otherwise, this is a skippo!', 'First timer! Came on a Wednesday, no wait & accidentally ordered a roasted milk tea...! After i realized my mistake i hurry and ask if its ok to change to mango matcha milk tea & paid a $.50 cent different~ pheww that was close! Ugh it was so good! Perfect sweetness in default level! I cant wait to be back . P.S: My girlfriend ordered a pineapple fruit tea, which was nothing special just very flavorful pineapple juice like.', 'A rather small hole in the way on the outside of a parking structure. Have been wanting to try this new boba spot and definitely not disappointed.I ordered a Matcha Sesame Latte, with boba and light ice. Recommendation is to stay at 100% sweetness and it was perfect. I loved the mixture of matcha and sesame. My cousin ordered for herself a classic black milk tea without boba at 70% sweetness. She preferred my matcha drink over her own drink. Next time I want to try their fruit drinks such as Mango Matcha and Peach tea.', ""Top notch boba! I had their lychee green tea with boba (70% sweetness) and it was delicious. They said their 100% sweetness is not too sweet compared to other boba shops, and they were right. I usually get 25-50% sweetness, and 70% at this place was perfect. The boba itself is perfectly chewy and had a great dark, malty sweetness. I tried my friend's black sesame milk (with almond milk) and it was delicious as well. If you don't mind the grittiness that is normal with sesame, I highly recommend. It was sweeter than the green tea, so I'd go with 50%.All in all, tasty boba place. If I'm ever in the area, I'd stop by again."", 'There aren\'t many places out there that do black sugar fresh milk with boba well. This is probably one of my favorite places that makes this type of drink. The black sugar and milk ratio is close to perfect and there is nothing else added except the black sugar and the milk, which I appreciate. No extra sugar or fillings. The boba is on the harder chewier side, so if you like that, this place is for you. I usually always get no ice for my drinks because I have sensitive teeth and I don\'t like drinking anything too cold. They only have a ""less ice"" option for this drink.... which I can never understand. Perhaps give the customers an option to add water instead of ice next time. Despite this, I still really enjoyed the drink and would recommend! Also, I felt like the prices were pretty reasonable. Interior: very small, there\'s a bar with maybe 4 seats that\'s right in front of the cashier. I can see lines flowing out of the store because there\'s no space! It\'s more of a grab and go type place. Service: the people were very nice and even asked me how the drink was!', 'Came here bc my husband said ""IT\'S SO GOOD!!! ITS MY FAVORITE BOBA PLACE IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA!"" (And we\'ve tried a lot all over socal and NorCal) So yeah, I had to try! The place is small, like really small, but sometimes small things pack a big punch. The line was out the door but it\'s because it\'s small hahaha so don\'t let that deter you from standing in line. The line goes quickly. My husband had the house black milk tea with boba 100% sweetness and I had the brown sugar milk with boba. Both drinks are part of their popular menu items, so you can\'t go wrong. And honestly, it\'s so damn good. If only they weren\'t in downtown SF I would frequent more often. Please come to San Mateo the NorCal mecca of Boba shops hahaha. YOU MUST VISIT THIS PLACE IF YOU LIKE MILKTEA OR ELSE YOU DO YOURSELF A DISSERVICE.', ""Wow, I like Black Sugar a lot! My boyfriend and I were in the city for the day and we wanted boba! We were in downtown and I remember hearing about Black Sugar so we decided to check this place out!The location is pretty convenient. It is a short walk from the mall. The store itself is not too big. It's more of a grab and go place rather than a place to hang out. They do have four chairs. I thought there would be a long line but we went around 2pm on a Saturday and there were only three people in front of us. We ordered one drink for each of us and they came out fairly quickly.My boyfriend ordered the House Black Milk Tea and I ordered the Oolong Milk Tea. Both drinks had boba. The Black Milk Tea tasted like Hong Kong Style Milk Tea.The quality was great and they had strong tea flavor. Even the cups were really good quality.Our drinks came out to be less than $10 in the heart of San Francisco. That's a steal! I cannot wait to come back to try their other drinks. Their other drinks looked really pretty and delicious too."", ""Heard about Black Sugar from someone and I've had it BM it for awhile. I usually don't make my way DT so didn't really have any chances to check out BS. Finally got to try it today. A lot smaller space than I thought. It's maybe 10x5 occupant space in front of the counter. I got the Roast Oolong Milk tea. They definitely know how to make a Roast Oolong MT right as it had that right amount of roasted and bitter tea flavor. The boba was just the right consistency of chewiness. The size of the drink was surprisingly small considering most places give you 24oz cup standard now while here gives you 16oz standard. BS is a lot like like Little Sweet in terms of flavor and texture at least for their Roast Oolong. Though little sweet gives you a larger cup and it's much more convenient for me to go there than coming to BS. All in all quality tea and boba but smaller than I'd like.""]"
Piccolo Petes Cafe,"[""French toast was great, they were out of original. The almond French toast was the best option, though. Don't be fooled, they say they give you a couple sticks and syrup but it's more than enough for one person. The almond French toast is croissant styled bread with almond filling and toasted almonds. The Littles toast is more of a sandwich; you have the option between one or two eggs with/without siracha. The bread they used for it was really good, not too heavy with a garlic aoli! All in all, great mom-and-pop stop! Don't plan on eating inside due to how small the space is, but was worth the stop!!"", 'A charming, cozy little hole-in-the-wall coffee shop. Really cozy. As in, there are two tables in the dining area, and the entire space could fit within a decent-sized master bedroom. Nevertheless, it is a great place to sit down and have coffee on a quiet Sunday. My sister and I decided to have brunch and coffee here one morning; we read over the short menu of food items and were excited to try the King Kong Toast - a toasted sweet bread with hazelnut spread, topped with bananas, walnuts, and condensed milk. The coffee was nice enough, and the toast tasted as good as it looked (can you ever go wrong with bananas and Nutella?). My sister probably summed it up best, though: ""Delicious, but I probably could have made it myself.""Overall, an endearing little café with friendly service, definitely worth a stop if you\'re in the area.', ""Such a cute little hole in the wall Family Owned Cafe!

The total came out to a total of $7? Which for SF prices is a steal. My latte was bold and strong. Just the way I like it and the Bf enjoyed the ice coffee ( though a bit acidic for me). Looking on their menu they have a nice selection of fancy toast to supplement your caffeine. However, seating is limited and the location would be more of a grab and go kind of joint.

You always run into the same people who work there which is nice, because it feels more like a small town than the big city. I\'ve tried a few different options there. They have rotating fresh juice in the mornings until they run out. It\'s usually some type of fruit like raspberries, and an herb like mint, or some unique combination. I\'ve tried the coffee, they have a Mexican mocha I believe which was fantastic!I heard they grind all the spices fresh which is the bomb. The food was amazing too!

Small local business - I love supporting small businesses and it\'s in my neighborhood!2. Ordered the King Kong Toast, which has a tasteful combination of fresh bananas, nutella, condensed milk, walnuts, etc. The dish itself was prepared really well.3. The ambiance of the place is nice, you can tell the owner and staff took effort in decorating and keeping the place neat and cute. There are mini potted succulents by the window and you feel like you\'re eating at an outdoor mini patio4. There\'s a ""Piccolo\'s"" sandwich shop right next door attached to the cafe. The cashier told me they often refer customers over to each other, which is a great way to build rapport and develop customer base. It also definitely opens up the variety of food available to a customer.5. Staff was friendlyThe Bads:1. Uhm, did I just pay $8 for a slice of fancy toast? Yes. Yes I did. Even though on yelp they\'re listed as one ""$"" sign. Felt a little deceived... esp also because if you compare past pictures of toasts to mine, the sizes look much smaller now. I was surprised how little I got for $8...2. They have the heat on way too high. And during summer in SF when the weather was like 65-70..?? I was trying to enjoy my breakfast while trying not to focus on myself sweating 3. Pretty limited menu: different toasts, coffee, and that\'s mostly it. Menu item prices for the toasts also have been up about $2 from the older photos on Yelp. A simple toast runs you $5-6 and a more flavored one $7-9. The portion size is pitiful, too. All in all, great food presentation and taste. I understand that small businesses probably can\'t afford much space due to high rent, and I could ask staff to turn down the heat. So not counting those critiques: for me it\'s still not worth the price. Why pay $8 for fancy toast when I could probably get a full meal like Ike\'s, ramen, or burrito for $10-11?

I had the Ham & Cheese french toast, which was yummy. My man had the toast topped with brie cheese, mushrooms and honey (quite tasty!)Our total for the french toast (aka 1 croissant, ""frenched"") 1 toast with toppings, 1 large chai and 1 large spicy mocha) was $26, so that is a pretty penny.Less than 5 stars for 2 reasons: the chai was very milky and very little chai tasting, and the total price for everything.SUPER happy I made it to this place that I had bookmarked for years, but likely will not be back.', 'This little place is as yummy as it is cute.

But Equator Coffees itself is so much more. I ordered the scratch carmel latte and a chia seed pudding this morning and I'm a fan. The line moved pretty quickly and the cashier was a delight for so early in the morning! So many choices on the menu so I was actually glad for the line. From coffees to matchas to breakfast tacos and puddings, Equator Coffees is filled to the brim of great options for breakfast and snacks.

In fact, it may have sparked a new obsession. I ordered a batch brew, which was made from the 'Equator Blend.' I really liked it -- medium roast, smooth, and not too acidic of an aftertaste. It was reminiscent of Philz Tesora Soul, which is one of my favorites. I ended up buying whole beans of the same blend, so I'll be excited to make it at home as well. I thought that the prices were fair -- $2.75 for a 10oz. cup and $15.50 for a 12oz. bag of whole beans. They also stock limited quantities of special batches, which would bump the price range more toward $5-6/cup and $20-25 for a bag. Based on their standard selections, the limited batches are likely worth it and I plan to give them a try next time. Moreover, even if you are not a coffee drinker, they appeared to offer ample selection by way of loose-leaf teas.Things of note: you need to enter the Linkedin lobby in order to access the cafe and be prepared for a 10-15 minute wait in line if you go during lunch. Some major attributes of Equator are that it is a female-owned enterprise and it is a B-Corp, which means it should ideally be able to transparently report on social or environmental returns. In summary, it's kind of a no-brainer to support Equator because of its delicious coffee and commitment as a mission-oriented organization.

It was okay but I wouldn't order again.The other times I've come I ordered a Latte and a Matcha Latte, as well as the iced versions. I really like their iced Matcha because it is very refreshing. When you get the drinks, they give it to you without a cap.The only downside is when there are a lot of people, they take down your name but sometimes they don't call it correctly or they don't even have the name down...

It felt like I was walking into an art museum that had a little coffee counter. A little strange, but there was quite a bit of open seating so I ordered a latte and sat down at one of the long counters to charge my laptop and phone. The guy who took my order was super friendly and polite. The latte was good, pretty standard. The price was also not too expensive for the area, I thought. The seating is a little odd as it's mostly huge, long tables that don't seem conducive to a meeting or anything like that. Mostly I just saw individuals with their headphones on. Definitely a central location to many businesses in the area so I feel like it probably gets pretty busy during peak times."", ""A beautiful, beautiful space in the lobby of the LinkedIn building.

Hands down. It is just the right amount of sweetness but not too sweet. The oak milk gives it a nice nutty flavor but still keeps it pretty light, definitely not too nutty. This is a must try!Banana bread: The banana bread here is super yummy and a great snack for when you need something to hold you over until your next meal :)Veggie Scone: As someone who generally craves savory and warm snacks, this was a great find.

If you didn\'t know, POPOS is an acronym for privately-owned public open space.

Blue Bottle Coffee,"[""Really nice coffee shop. I was visiting from out of town and stumbled on this place when I was looking for a coffee shop near my hotel. I typically don't like experimenting with new and different coffee drinks (I stick to my usual iced or hot latte), but I decided to be a little spontaneous and asked the barista what he'd recommend, which was some sort of New Orleans drink. I really enjoyed it and now hate that I'm rarely ever in SF cause it was really good. I gave them 4 stars because I wish they had more food options. I was there around breakfast time and they only had a few cookies and croissants, not a lot of options."", ""The best coffee in the city, although I do love \xa0almond rose coffee from illy.

I grew up in Cambodia and traveled to Vietnam a lot and these are big coffee drinking country so coffee was my go-to drink ever since I was a kid. I'm always out looking for the best coffee in every city and here I am at another great one in the city, Blue Bottle Coffee.Blue Bottle has become big enough that they are in whole foods and have multiple locations in the city, but that doesn't mean they become overrated. This is the first time I've been to one of their locations since I usually just pick up a cold brew at Whole Foods so I was pretty excited. I'm also a sucker for aesthetically pleasing coffee shops so I can get instagram worthy shots as well so this place was a hit! I got the Cafe Mocha with Hayes Valley blend and asked for very little sugar and it was amazing! The latte art is nice and cute and they filled it up to the very top so I hate to walk like an old lady to get to our seats and grab an instagram worthy picture. I also LOVE marble and this location is filled with marbles as their counter/tabletops. So aesthetically pleasing, check, marble, check, great looking cup of coffee, check AND coffee that actually taste as good as they look, CHECK! I love everything except the fact that they don't have wifi or outlets. This is pretty shocking to me because there are decent amount of seating everywhere and working at coffee shop is kind of a thing for me, so it was a bummer. Now...I am writing this review, on my laptop here...but of course I have to tether myself to get internet and I have an external battery pack to charge my laptop so if you do still want to do some work here, I highly recommend packing some external battery and having tethering or some way to access the internet. Otherwise, it is more recommended for catching up with friends or some light browsing that you won't kill your battery for. This is probably the only reason why I would put this place as a 4/5 instead of 5/5.TLDR: Great coffee, Instagram worthy coffee shop, no outlets or wifi."", 'A great coffee stop while walking around downtown San Francisco.We swung in to this location when we flagged the blue bottle logo; we had hoped to try it while in SF, but hadn\'t gone out of our way to find one yet.The place was steady when we were there at noonish on a Saturday, but it didn\'t take long to order. I got a cold brew (warmer in SF than Virginia this time of year, and I had been walking with my baby on my back, so I felt too hot for a hot coffee drink) which came right out, and was tasty and smooth.It was right on par with most local coffee roaster cold brews and would be a good go to for the warmer days. I can\'t give it five stars because my bar has been set (maybe unusually) high by a coffee roaster back in Virginia whose cold brew just floats down your throat, sending caffeine into your bloodstream like a spoon full of sugar as Mary Poppins would say. But I digress.My husband got a holiday blend drip, but we watched them make it and they made a pour over, so because it was a pour over it took a few minutes to come out. I\'m not sure if they always do pour overs rather than a typical drip, or if something was wrong with their coffeemaker, because it did say drip on the menu, not pour over. His coffee was really good, hot and festive with a hint of spice, without having any overpowering, cloying ""holiday"" flavors.I would definitely frequent blue bottle if I was local to the Bay Area, and will revisit if I return!', ""Great coffee.

In fact, I would be disappointed that I couldn't give it more. The New Orleans Cold Brew and their oat milk lattes are some of the best coffee in the Bay. I am also a huge fan of just about all of their pour overs, and even will grab a mocha from time to time. Nothing here has come even remotely close to disappointing me.There are two things that prevent me from giving it the perfect score, though. One of those things is the fact that the wait for coffee here is ALWAYS long. I came in at 6am one day, and it tool 6 minutes to get a latte. Granted, it was because they were doing training, but my goodness there were 3 of us in there. That's simply too long, IMO. Especially when their on-peak wait times are almost double that, if you're unlucky. It bums me out.Secondly, there is no Wi-Fi here. Huge bummer. I love this place so much, but I feel like a total loser going into Starbucks or Peet's with a Blue Bottle cup and just freeloading. I would come here a lot more if it were a realistic destination at which to do some work. Sadly unless I use my hot-spot, it is not. Woof.Anyway, the coffee and service here are fantastic. These folks know and love coffee, and you can definitely taste the care that goes into the craft. Just wish it didn't take so darn long. Or, if it were going to take long, that I could get some work done while I wait. What a shame!"", 'Oat milk latte. Enough said. Blue bottle does it again! Great, smooth taste. And this location is particularly lovely with the large arches and windows. Great for a morning coffee hit.', ""Blue Bottle is (admittedly) overpriced and extremely slow, but they are extremely consistent in the quality of their coffee. Amongst the different high end coffee shops in the city, Blue Bottle still reigns as one of my favorites (both for mochas and lattes). This one usually has a line out the shop since it's in a high-density working area. There's two payment areas but I've usually only seen one person behind the register, so the line moves pretty slowly for the high volume of patrons who frequent this shop. It probably doesn't matter in the end, though, because the space behind the counter is extremely small and the rate that the drinks are produced is alarmingly slow. There's usually a couple baristas for espresso drinks, and one doing the drip coffees and tea. I will likely still come to this location, but make sure you allot yourself up to 15m (or more) minutes during peak times, like in the mornings before work."", 'AMAZING service! Drink came out to perfection. A wonderful start to another crazy day in the Bay!', ""This Blue Bottle Coffee is just plain cool. Nestled inside the lobby of a classic office building in downtown San Francisco, this modern bar looks almost as great as their coffee drinks.

There were a few morning runners and maybe a few bringing a drink back to their Saturday night guest! This location has a pretty full menu including a wonderful reserve Rwandan espresso which was amazing on a cool and sunny morning.

I think I actually prefer this to my usual Bonsoy/unsweetened Silk soy lattes!

I was shocked, mind you that my previous coffee go-tos were always the sweet flavored drinks from Starbucks. Funny how your taste buds can change overtime... Trying out Blue Bottle elevated my spectrum of coffee, but then again, maybe just being in the Bay Area does that to you anyways. It's true, SF peeps are coffee snobs and like their good coffee! Blue Bottle has always been consistent with quality and taste. Their flavors are really strong so I always love getting a latte to add in the creaminess from the milk. I also adore their HOUSE MADE LIEGE WAFFLES. 5/5 stars for sure. They are hot off the press, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, with just a touch of sweet caramelized sugar goodness.

Contraband Coffee Bar,"[""Addicted! I came here once before last year, ordered a latte and enjoyed it- wasn't anything out of the ordinary.

He ordered the Bhakti chai and I am almond milk latte. Much to my surprise, when we received our orders I somehow had an almond milk Bhakti chai- and it was the BEST mistaken order! The chai was creamy, slightly spicy and perfectly sweet! We loved it so much, we made a second stop that evening for a second round.The taste of that chai lingered with me all week, so I made my way down again, this time, per recommendation, ordering the pirate matcha chai. This was definitely more spice. The chai was overpowered by the matcha, but it worked well as I walked home through the cold. Would I order it again? Probably not- I'll stick to the Bhakti chai :)Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!"", ""Coffee takes way too long and is not good enough for the price. To add to it, the staff is rude to customers. For a $6 cup of small coffee, one would expect some kind of decency. Asking questions or trying to figure out how to pay when their register isn't working is met with hostility from the staff.When their management is informed of the problems with their staff, they respond just as rudely, if not worse.

He returns my change with $10. I corrected him to say ""Oh, I gave you a $50 bill."" He returns the correct amount of change with no sincerity and a nice classic eyeroll. The interior has one large community table with limited amount of energy outlets. The music was obnoxiously loud- hard to have a normal conversation or study.

Not the best, but certainly not the worst considering it was made with almond milk. However the sage rosemary syrup is very potent, and there was way too much in my drink. This made the whole cappuccino taste bitter and unbalanced, since it completely overwhelmed the coffee flavour, and honestly isn't a great pairing. I've had these kinds of herbaceous additions at other coffee spots that were done much better, and provided a subtle enhancement as opposed to a palette blaster like this was.

It's not simply fuel, a jolt, something to sip on (in some/many cases a necessary input for proper functioning...); it's something to be enjoyed which places you in a setting of spontaneous inspiration, the cafe.

My friends and I were visiting from out of town and after a day of shopping we made our coffee stop. \xa0We had moved on to another store when I realized I left my Zara shopping bag. Thankfully they had put it away up stairs for safe keeping. Thank you Iron Horse for great coffee and for saving the day!', 'The place which serves amazing drinks, hard to find in the whole city. The service is amazing. Perfect hidden spot in such a beautiful city! Love it!', 'First time coming by after passing by this great cocktail and coffee hole-in-the-wall many times over the last few years! Their iced honey latte (tastes like real honey with a sprinkle of cinnamon) is amazing refreshing, would just come back here for that! Service was quick and was so glad they took Applepay as well!', 'Tiny little barista tucked in a great shopping/boutique area of town. \xa0Loved the barista and he pulls a mean espresso.', ""They charge 50 cents extra for ICE. They charge extra for solid water cubes and less actual drink.. I'm so confused."", 'Wow, smooth yet strong espresso - double shot with soy $4.5. Reminded me of being in Europe.I was pleasantly surprised by the kick from this coffee - way prefer this to the blue bottle oji or philz ecstatic or TesoraPlace is tucked away- which is even more awesome bc that meant no line. Outdoor patio seats available, will definitely be backTip: for spaniards, they make cortados!', ""If you blink, you might miss this quirky little coffee shop (coffee nook might be a more appropriate term) near Union Square, but it's worth finding if you like checking out unusual indie coffee shops. This coffee bar share's space with an actual bar - Iron Horse is right inside the front door in a small nook....not tons of counter space, but clearly enough room to make some good coffee! The barista working there when we visited was really friendly and happy to give a sample of the coffee. There's a countertop that runs along the opposite wall with some stools to hang out at for a bit out of the cold. Prices are pretty reasonable for San Francisco, and even if it might not be a big spot you could spend all day in, it's worth the visit to check out this little coffee shop!In the later morning they put out chairs and tables in the street outside -- they were putting them out as we were leaving; on a warmer day with the sun overhead this would probably be a great place to chill for a while (there's free wifi)."", ""Great dirty chai. Not much sitting space inside but cool aura. Outside tables and chairs. They offer adult coffee too so that's a plus"", 'Wanted a good cup of coffee and we found it in this little place. We actually walked by it initially and Thank God we turned back. It was great! \xa0We are talking small- maybe 6 by 4 feet, just enough for one Barista (see photos). \xa0She was awesome and told us a little about her history. She shares space with the ""Romper Room"" and so you have to look carefully for the sign that says ""Coffee That Doesn\'t Suck"" ( her paper cups say the same-great marketing). \xa0Love those smaller independent coffee shops. Hope to go back again']"
Crown & Crumpet Tea Stop Cafe,"[""I have such lovely memories of coming here on Valentine's Day in 2016 with one of my best girlfriends. Granted I have not been back to visit since, as I moved to Los Angeles later that year, but I remember we had the best time. Our server was a jolly woman who was nothing short of perfect and offered us glasses of champagne while we admired the variety of teas and treats on the menu. I would have never thought that a tea room in such a modern building would be enjoyable, as I have always experienced high tea in cozy, quaint shops, but we had an excellent couple hours, enjoying all of the positive, happy vibes bouncing off the walls. Also, the parking garage across the street was great and made it possible for us to fully appreciate our experience, as there is nothing more aggravating than having to drive around for ages trying to find a spot.I would definitely stop by Crown & Crumpet again, the next time I'm in the area!"", ""Cute little afternoon tea place in Japan Town.Cute teas, cute cups and saucers, cute decor.I've passed this place by quite a bit but this was the first time I tried it and we had a nice time!My favorite part were the scones with jam and clotted cream. \xa0The scones were dense and buttery while the jam was very strawberry-t and the cream a perfect complement. \xa0Today's option was blueberry, but it looks like they have other scones at different times.The sandwiches were fine (I like the mini sausage roll, but puff pastry+Vienna sausage will get me every time) and the other desserts were fine too. \xa0Nothing to write home about.But I'd come back for the scones!"", ""I really enjoyed Crown and Crumpet! A friend and I visited this tea stop cafe on a Wednesday early afternoon and there were only a few people there. The LivingSocial deal was great. It was $48 for 'Afternoon Tea' for two people (on a weekday) which is a good deal because regular price is $34 a person. I didn't realize it's just inside of the New People building. The ambience was kind of awkward just because it's out in the open and anyone walking by can look at you. \xa0Minus one star for the environment.I loved the 3 tiered stand with all the goodies. Bottom tier had a variety of tea sandwiches and salad, middle tier was warm biscuits with 3 different spreads, top tier was chocolate covered strawberries, brownies, and other little dessert treats. Everything was delicious! I thought I might be hungry afterwards, but there was so much food included in the package that we even brought some of the desserts home.I tried the Paris tea which was delicious! Perfect balance of vanilla and caramel and... tea! Added a little milk and sugar to top it off. My friend had the lychee tea. It was a bit too strong of Lychee flavor for my taste, though.Customer service was great! Our server topped off our tea after a while to make sure it was nice and hot. He periodically checked on us to ensure we were enjoying ourselves. Since the location is in Japantown, it was a bit difficult to find parking. There are meters close by and also hour-limit parking around too.I will definitely come back and bring other people to this spot. This was my first tea party experience in San Francisco and I was really satisfied with this venue."", ""This place is a real gem. Not only do they accommodate gluten free customers with superb quality goodies, but they were even able to accommodate my keto diet! It was difficult to resist the tempting sandwiches and especially the gf scones looked and smelled divine - my daughter (whose 17th birthday we were celebrating) said they were the best scones she's ever had, gluten free or conventional.The space is a little odd, sharing the entry with the an escape room and a small theater downstairs. Bit once we got settled in it was simply perfect. The decor, the service and the food were all impressive."", ""I have been here before with my boyfriend on a date nearly 3 years ago. It's a very tiny space located in the lobby of the New People building of Japantown. The decor is very girly and cute, reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland. The food doesn't really stand out here. It's nice, but not stellar, and not worth near $40 in value. I was also disappointed that they had no petit fours, which is my favorite dessert to have with high tea.I only chose this place to come for my most recent high tea experience because my friend had never been here before. We both enjoy high tea, so this was a place for her to at least try.Despite being 15 minutes late to our reservation, I appreciated that the waitstaff was still so accommodating. My friend ended up being half an hour late, and while waiting for her, our waiter was so nice and patient to explain the different teas to us. I was intrigued by the Alice Drink Me Tea, which is a super floral black tea. I found the scent to be very fragrant and lovely. The waiter warned it could be in your face, but I appreciated the strong aroma.While the waitstaff was nice, they have to kick you out since they need to adhere to time limits for everyone. My friend was appalled they would do that. While I can understand that, it does suck to have to take my leftovers to go."", ""Had a lovely lunch with my granddaughter (our second visit). Service, ambiance and food were all excellent. Their lemon ginger scones served with Devon cream, lemon curd and strawberry preserves were scrumptious - I've had scones all over the US and England, and these were exceptional. Highly recommended."", 'For some reason, my friend and I keep coming here every 2 years, but this will be my first time writing a review.Despite it\'s horrible location (awkwardly on the first floor lobby of a ""mall"" and there\'s no parking except for street and the expensive garage), this place is wonderful. They make the space work and keep it cute! Service here is always 200% amazing, and the food is always good. They take reservations through Yelp which saves so much time because they are usually busy. I usually order the Afternoon Tea for One and special request for vegetarian and fruit free (stupid raw fruit allergy), and they always make it work. Thank you for that because I know it is inconvenient for the kitchen. My only complaint are the desserts they pick for the Afternoon Tea sets are too sweet and don\'t fit with the high tea vibe. I wished they would consider something like jam cookies or maybe a slice of cake. Other than that you guys are great, and I love coming here!', 'This place is really cute! We had a reservation so we sat down right away. We also came during the holiday season so there was a holiday menu, cute decorations, and a photo area for pictures! We also got cute little prizes with the holiday ""cracker"" as part of the holidays. Our server was really nice and he was understanding of how we wanted to take pics and helped us take our pics too! Good ones at that :) we came for my friend\'s birthday and sang happy birthday!Platter favorites:-blueberry scones were amazing! I really liked the lemon curd and cottage spread! Very tasty-turkey and cranberry tea sandwich and egg salad because I like tiny sandwiches-salmon toast -fudge brownie dessertTeas:-merry matcha was very fragrant and had a sweet taste. Tasted better on its own -earl gray was pretty standard-peach green tea was light -grapefruit green tea was light and tasty! Very refreshing. No need for sugar or milk-English black tea was good! I like to put milk and sugar for it to taste like milk tea hahaOverall, very cute place! I think it is worth the money since you leave feeling full! They even offered to box up our leftovers and gave us a cookie to go :)', 'Yes, yes, and yes! This place is hidden (literally) in Japantown and is very cute. \xa0I was confused when the Uber driver dropped me off because I was not expecting this place to be in Japantown.Regardless, anyone who fancy tea time needs to come try this place out. \xa0They have ""Afternoon Tea for One"" for $32, which is very reasonable. \xa0This \xa0option comes with your choice of loose leaf tea, sandwiches, one scone, one crumpet, clotted cheese, lemon curd, jam, and a few bites size sweets. \xa0My favorite was their blueberry scone. \xa0Nom. Nom. \xa0The Tea for One really does fill you up. If you have a group of friends, you can enjoy different types of tea. \xa0We tried the Lychee Black Tea, Chai tea, their premium black tea (my favorite), and a green tea (that I don\'t remember the name). \xa0So put on your pretty dress and make a reservation via Yelp and enjoy some tea!', ""Not the audience for this kind of places but it was a good experience for the girls. Service, food and tea were great. Giving it 4 stars since being an entry to a shopping center doesn't help with the atmosphere and the price was a bit high."", ""My daughter and I went to Crown & Crumpet this morning for her friend's birthday tea party. It's located right in the middle of Japan town (so you can do your shopping at the Asian supermarkets or Daiso before or after tea)! So the tea shop is located on the ground floor with cute little tables and lovely decor. They have a party room upstairs and this is where we were seated. The decor is wonderful! They have a wall of china plates which they call The Great Wall of China (get it?)!!!! There is a large cardboard cut out of Queen Elizabeth so you are at tea with the queen! They had the table set up with crafts for the girls on one end and a few seats for adults on the other end. Our hits very graciously ordered high tea for parents as well! The hostess for the tea party takes care of everything...so parents can sit back and enjoy their tea as well. The girls made little craft bags and they were given an option of swamp tea (a tropical punch) or blue eyes (which was a pink punch of some sort).Their menu is quite extensive and they have a range of teas to choose from. The food trays arrived and we had an assortment of sandwiches, scones and sweet treats! It was thoroughly enjoyed by all!After we were done eating, sone games were played: \xa0tea bingo and pass the parcel. After this, birthday cupcakes! All in all the girls were entertained for a solid two hours. This is a great place to take your friends for tea, have a birthday party or a baby/bridal shower. We will definitely be back!"", ""Super random location, but affordable and great service. \xa0Crown & Crumpet occupies this random front entrance to the mall, by the New People door sign. \xa0Even as you sit there, it feels odd, random, and out of place- but it's kind of this awkward quirkiness which makes me like it. It definitely feels very Japan. They have a photo booth and photo booth wall with cutesy little chairs and table covers. \xa0They have a wide tea selection- our whole group got the nursery tea (the one for children, heh) because we wanted a wide sample of food. Our server was super friendly about it and we were super happy with the selection."", ""I love Crown and Crumpet so much! It's a perfect place for a birthday party (for any age) or a date, and sits in the heart of Japantown, right across from Benihana and the Kabuki theatre. Inside the building are Japanese shops to explore. As for tea, they have Afternoon tea which is the classic high tea option, which is cheaper for children! They also offer lunches and cheaper tea options if you don't want to go full high tea. They serve sandwiches of the day but always have vegetarian options prepared, you just need to ask!Don't forget to tell them if it's your birthday ;)"", ""Heather L. and I decided to splurge on an afternoon tea date. Customer service here was excellent. I asked for iced tea and they were able to accommodate my request without hesitation. Our waitress was also attentive to us and our needs/questions. A++++ My favorites from the afternoon tea spread were: all the sandwiches, blueberry and oat pastry, salted caramel brownie, scone, and crumpet. I was excited to see crumpets because I've never had one before. The texture was soft and fluffy! Yes, please. We were pretty full before we even got to the pastries! We ended up taking all of the pastries to go. Also, be sure to ask for refills of your tea. It's included! It's pretty pricey, but the overall experience was nice. I love having afternoon tea with the girls, so I personally think it's worth the price tag."", ""If you are in the market for an afternoon tea dearie, you'll likely find Crown and Crumpet an adorable and cheeky option in the city.Its located across the street from Japantown's Kintestsu Mall (the Japantown Peace Plaza) in the lobby of the modern, glass fronted New People Building. Despite their lobby set up, they have managed to make the space here feel cozy and as charming as is possible to given space constraints. \xa0We had the afternoon tea for $32, which is near impossible to find anywhere around town elsewhere on a Monday. \xa0(Many places in the city offer high tea on weekends only, or W-Sunday.)Our tea server was friendly and knowledgable, and was being served up with a British accent by owner Christopher Dean. \xa0Our tea included chopped egg & turkey, smoked salmon and pesto tea sandwiches, \xa0a petite cheese scone, the never eaten salad. \xa0On the middle tier, we were served crumpets and scones with clotted cream, jam and lemon curd. \xa0On the top layer, desserts, including matcha cake with strawberry frosting, caramel chocolate brownies, rose infused shortbread, and a chocolate covered strawberry. They have a fairly concise tea selection here, but the list included many herbal and black tea options. \xa0Charming spot, full of groups of ladies in summer dresses having tea!"", ""In the past I have hated on crown and crumpets but I recently went again and I actually quite enjoyed myself. It is still definitely one of the more expensive high tea places and doesn't give that much food, however the food I had was really really tasty. Specifically, I LOVED the scone and crumpet. The scone did still have that dryer texture but it tasted really good. Plus I love that they give you a crumpet because that is more unique. The crumpet was perfect. The cucumber mint sandwich was very tasty as was the turkey blt. The sausage rolls smelled really good but were meh (we didn't need to get a separate order of sausage rolls.) The desserts were good as well. I had a great time chatting with my friend and sipping tea. Oh! I got the Marie Antoinette tea and that was really super tasty. I would come back again!"", 'I think this place is over-rated. The establishment is really small and located in the lobby of a hotel. It was very hard to find and they do not answer their phone when I tried to call them when I was lost. I called three times and no answer. I asked them why they did not answer and they said they were busy and rarely answer during peak times. The assortment of teas was alright but the tea came out lukewarm\u200b. The food was decent but I would have liked more variety of\u200b cakes and sandwiches for the price.', 'Love this place! The decor is so cute and the food/tea is lovely! Definitely reminds me of being back home in England! Staff are also super friendly too! A good selection of teas :)', 'Wow wow wow, took my two favorite ladies into the city to celebrate my wife passing her CFRN! We arrived more than 45 early... we expected to wait... nope not their style.... they welcomed us with class and a smile! Made us feel at home! Staff was very friendly and efficient! The tea came out... great flavors.... then the very yummy finger foods... very enjoyable time in all! Will be back again soon', ""Very cute Decor with a nice variety of tea flavors. Staff has always been friendly whenever I eat there. They're a bit pricey compared to other tea houses but sometimes they'll have a deal online. It's definitely worth a visit and it great for girls day or a birthday party or just to stop in for a treat.""]"
Ritual Coffee Roasters,"['This is just an amazing place. \xa0Love the environment and all the various places to sit around the nursery after you buy your coffee (or for me, the Dandelion Mocha). \xa0I am not a big coffee drinker, but this location is so unique, I would come back here just for a beautiful place to share a cup of coffee (hot or iced) or tea with a friend...looking forward to going back soon!Happy Eating!', ""Coffee shop and plant store in one spot? Count me in. I first stumbled into this place back in June. Having already patronized their café in the Mission District, Hayes Valley, Haight and Castro District, I knew I was bound to check out a new coffee spot.Ritual Coffee tucked away in the back corner inside Flora Grubb Gardens? It's a really wonderful idea. I like this concept.Of the items I have been here, my latte is always ready to retrieve within minutes of ordering. The service is excellent, orders are completed fast and the baristas are very friendly.

Everything is made on order, which you can see due to their open kitchen layout.The service is excellent--wait times are fast. Even though there were a lot of space because it\'s tucked in a corner, the orders came out real fast so there was virtually no wait.There is a separate ""room"" area in the back where they have seats just for Ritual customers, kind of like a ""backyard"", which is nice.The only downside is when we asked for one of their tea items on their menu, they ran out, but it happens. Not their fault.Overall, definitely worth coming back whenever you are in the area!', 'A really cool place, with a nice vibe, good coffee, and some pretty fantastic cookies.', ""I went to Ritual when I went to check out Flora Grubb Gardens. Ritual is nestled in a corner of the nursery's store. Even tucked away like that, it seems to have a following. Considering the serene location, I imagine people find it to be a nice retreat. there is only a few bar stools in terms of seating, but you can take your coffee into the garden and sip among the succulents and other green things. I wasn't actually looking for something hot. I just wanted something refreshing.The Cherry Bomb hit the bill. It is NOT sweet. It is a fruity, refreshing jolt to the system that will wake you up and put a pep in your step. It's really pretty, too. It even comes with a cherry on top. After your of buying $5 coffee at Starbucks, I didn't bat at eye at the $6 price tag. They also have pretty good cookies too. A bought a nicely packaged bag of thumbprints for a gift. my Mom offered me one later that day,The cookies were just the right size to hold an entire mini peanut butter cup on top. They were a bit of crumbly of crumbly, buttery goodness. if you live strong coffee balance by serene settings and some good people watching try this little slice of awesomeness in Bayview."", ""A coffee shop located in an oasis like garden/plant shop.

The coffee store is located inside the Flora Grubb store and this location is everything :) The coffee here is similiar to any other ritual coffee roaster. I ordered the 8oz latte with 1 shot and the total came out to $3.75. I feel like the latte here is somewhat cheaper than other places because most latte's are upwards of $4-5. I like how this ritual coffee store is more than a store because it's essentially located inside a garden. Feel free to walk around the store and explore some of the plants and art pieces.

I came to the gardens to check them out and grab a tea. Tea is just some leaves and hot water. It is usually priced equally to or cheaper than coffee drinks. The tea here is $8.

Ritual: you can do better."", ""A coffee shop, located in the middle of an urban plant nursery? You have to be kidding me! When we were visiting our friends in SF, they took us to Flora Grubb Gardens to shop around. Being that I didn't want to spend an arm & a leg on overpriced succulents & plants , I opted to buy a coffee & pastry at Ritual and relax on their back patio.2 iced coffees & 2 pastries roughly came to $14.00. Yes it's a bit on the pricey side, but when the coffee & pastries are both equally as good, I can't really complain. Their iced coffee is strong & sweet, while their homemade pastries are to die for. Do yourself a favor and order their homemade oreos - we easily could have eaten 5 of these. Their salted chocolate chip cookie was also decadent. This place is a hipsters, DIY-er's, coffee lovers dream. I mean, even if you don't buy anything here, enjoy sun bathing on one of their many patio chairs that are scattered throughout Flora Grubb. They have parking and a variety of plants & knick-knacks to look at."", 'I love this place. Worth the price. The setting is nice, too - being able to sit in a garden and sip delicious cappuccino.

It was cool to watch them make coffee pouring one at a time. I had the cappuccino of course and it was good. We also had their chocolate-less brownie which had a very interesting texture and taste to it. I was educated that Ritual Coffee specializes on ""Light Roast"" only. So if you are a dark roast fan, this will not work for you.If you are looking to unwind and relax and want a room with a green view, come visit Ritual Coffee at this location. There are plenty of chairs to hangout either at their coffee patio or at Flora Garden\'s lounge display that they have for sale! There are plenty street parking and a few private spots in front of their business.PS - they have several locations to serve you including one in Napa and I\'ve been to the one on Valencia Street.Cheers~', ""My wife and I stopped here since I had seen this on one of the weekly yelp articles. It is very nice to navigate through the plants and decorations of the nursery, and you can make your way to the back where the coffee shop is. My wife got her usual Americano and I got a pour over, which I can't remember what the beans were called. It was nice because they grind the beans for each cup but neither of the drinks were anything to rave about. Probably would not be back since it was out of the way to get here."", 'Tucked away in this cute little garden/nursery called Flora Grubb Gardens this is an urban oasis right in the middle of baypoint. The nursery has a huge selection from lemon trees to succulents, there is even table space for folks to create their own succulents. Besides serving ritual coffee my absolute favorite, (try the cherry bomb ice brew) they have benches and chairs and cute little decks for folks to sit and enjoy. We along with our pooch found a cute little sitting area to enjoy our coffees and with the sun shining brightly it was a perfect fall morning in SF. Prices are a little bit higher than what I usually spend (I shop for my plants at Home Depot and Lowes) but the nursery space is absolutely wonderful to enjoy and to get great ideas!']"

Big chains make matcha lattes, but they are laden with sugar!! I was so impressed that the barista took the time to answer my ridiculous cleanse ingredient questions and made me the best matcha ever! I love love love the coffee here, but this matcha is AMAZING! I love that they make cortados, have nitro coffee and sell Underwood wine in a can. The location is perfect with plenty of seating outside if you want to buy a pastry and enjoy your drink (they sell pastries, too!). It's a great atmosphere near Fort Mason.

I arrived just around 8:30a, and since it\'s near the schools, I was sure it would be packed and I\'d find no parking. I was pleasantly surprised to find a spot out front, and a not so busy restaurant inside. I ordered the original ""Jacob"", which I really loved. The service was pleasant, and they also ground up a 1/2 pound of that same roast for me to-go. It\'s much better than what I had been pouring at my house. I\'d definitely go back, and maybe even go there hungry. The breakfast toasts and bowls looked amazing!', 'Shaun who fulfill our orders could not make a medium sugar level coffee...

Whether you're a student, remote employee or just an overall coffee fiend this Ocean Avenue location may just be a new part of your daily routine. The ambiance is really great here.

There's lot of natural light shining through (when it's not too foggy here hehe), but Yelper be warned that even though there is a good amount of seating - seats are likely to be taken quickly! Doable, but also keep your eyes peeled.As always, coffee here is also reliable. If you want something refreshing I'd definitely go for the mint mojito! I know this is basic and really a popular choice of many but seriously it's so good. Unless you don't like mint, then maybe just get a regular coffee jk.

I don\'t know if it\'s stigmas against me, or that Philz has really gone downhill over the years, or Philz employees are just snooty, entitled hipsters. Probably all the above. This is probably one of the newest Philz, in one of the most rapidly-gentrifying parts of the city. When I last went to this Philz, it seemed like 100% of their customers and employees were snooty, tattoed, extremely stylish Millenials in their 20s and younger. City College area just gets more bougie and gentrified by the day. Just a few short years ago, that area was still ghetto, cold, sparse, and uncool - what a mere community college area should be like. But with the opening of Whole Foods, and the resultant barrage of hip businesses and expensive housing - the City College area has gotten to be as snotty hipster as the rest of the city. Well. A while ago, I politely asked the cashier for a restroom code, and before I was able to finish my sentence, she angrily muttered the code - as if to slam it in my face. I get that ""cattle"" tone and subhuman treatment constantly - but it\'s even worse at hipster elitist places like Philz. Um, I\'m more Philz than any of you - I\'ve been to Philz ever since they opened in the mid-2000s, and to every location in SF, and I\'ve tried all 12 of their coffees multiple times each. I\'m so much more fully Philz than any of you - and you dare think I don\'t belong, stick out like a sore thumb, and deserve the most demeaning, contemptuous treatment?Another time I went, I was digging in my tote bag for my wallet, and the hipster cashier rudely kept tapping at the counter - even as I profusely kept apologizing for keeping her waiting - for like 30 seconds. The disgust and disdain for certain unattractive Asians like me is everywhere, and extreme, uncalled for, and absolutely unacceptable. At every table and sofa at Philz - all the snooty trendy Millenials avoided eye contact with me completely, and if they happened to see me, they gave a disgusted look and quickly looked away, like they saw the most lowly thing on earth. Remember, I started going to Philz, all their stores, enthusiastically, long before they ever had coffee in their lives. Who\'s more Philz - me or them?The coffee I got the last time I went was pretty bad, too - so undrinkable, I thought of throwing it out after a few sips. The only saving grace for Philz is that they do purport to hear about your complaints - though I don\'t know if they actually take action after hearing my complaints. I don\'t know if they actually try to train staff to always treat ALL customers with the same amount of warmth, fairness, and respect. It\'s an unwelcoming, rude place for Asians who look older and fobby - and I\'m neither old nor fobby (I\'m US-born) - but that\'s how I\'m adamantly seen, treated, brutalized, and excluded.', ""3.5 stars. Coffee is pretty reliable as most Philz goes, a fantastic abundance of outlets and a decent amount of seating. Good location with good food selections nearby, and parking is not too bad with Whole Foods across the street and a fair amount of 2 hr street parking. BaristasThe bathroom is the main reason I just can't give an excellent review... Horrid. Literally always reeks of urine (probably because the toilet doesn't have any water in it at baseline, but really God knows why). Paper towels and toilet paper everywhere..... frequently out of toilet seat covers. Whyyyyyy Philz!?!? You are a coffee shop. As coffee connoisseurs, you are aware that naturally, coffee = frequent trips to the bathroom. Restroom maintenance is essential."", ""Of all the Philz in the city this one is by far my favorite. First off its huge, so there is ample seating area. Although sometimes it can be packed with college students, it is still more spacious then the rest of the Philz in the city.Second off, they move quickly, they seem to have a longer coffee bar and more stuff---SO LESS WAIT TIME.Finally, there is usually parking nearby, if you can't find street parking there is a whole foods next door with a parking lot so you can also get some groceries , two birds with one stone (or parking spot in this case)!"", ""They don't have Sonoma Roll Bacon for their breakfast sandwiches at this location even though their breakfast sandwich sign says they do. The girl at the counter (Caucasian, short reddish hair) doesn't seem open to updating the sign. Misleading customer service. I'm a student at CCSF and would've been a regular customer here. I will go elsewhere as I was turned off by her attitude and lack of customer service."", 'Hi Phil,Your coffee is something but the experience at philz is always unpleasant...Every time I step in I did not feel welcomed. And the Batista was always in a bad mood or something. What did I do wrong? Sincerely,Another customer', ""This was my second visit to a Philz Coffee - I actually requested that my friend take me here so I can have another Iced Mint Mojito. It's so good!! They make all their drinks on the spot, so you're always getting fresh coffee. The baristas were really nice and friendly. Cashiers were also very friendly and nice. We ordered breakfast - I had their breakfast sandwich, BF had a chocolate croissant, and our friend had a scone. Everything was tasty and filled us up before our drive down to Monterey."", ""Philz Coffee and their mint mojitos can always get me through the day. This particular Philz is pretty big and there's plenty of space to sit and do work or chat with friends. So as mentioned, I always get their mint mojito even though I pretend to think I'll try something different. It's hard not to get mint mojito whenever you're at Philz, the next best thing is to probably buy a bag of Philz coffee for home use. You order first, try your drink and let them know if it's perfect for you, then pay. Generally, I try not to make them remake my drink more than twice cause you know, don't be wasteful. So if you ever find yourself in need of a study cafe, Philz is a great option."", ""A very cool hang out/study spot near CCSF. Great \xa0music selection- 90s r&b, early 2000s, todays hits. Lots of seating and convenient for city college students. I do like that they have outdoor seating for those special sunny days. Cool that they're open until 8 for those late evening commuters like myself. It's right on Ocean, so what parking? Best bet would be to drive around the neighborhood. I'll be here more often than I should be."", 'Always enjoy philz! Great energy, great people, and great coffee! Love the open mics!!!!', ""I can't get enough of their mint mojito! It tastes so unique and so good! Don't ask for half sugar, it wouldn't be the same taste anymore . Go for cream and sugar. Aside from their awesome drink, I also enjoy the vibe of this place.

At least if your going to be expensive, be kind', ""Philz was so smart to open up this location - right across the street from City College, at the base of a brand new apartment building, and very close to a huge MUNI and BART hub. They have plenty of indoor AND outdoor seating - great place for students, WFH-ers and just passer-bys looking for a pick-me-up. If you haven't been to Philz before, here's the drill: Walk in, order at the bar with an available barista, walk over to the register to order food/pastries and pay for your drink while you wait for your drink to be ready. My usual go to is the Mint Mojito Iced Coffee (basic... I know, but it's so good) my other go to would be a Mocha Tesora which is great. I love that they've opened up this new location on Ocean Ave."", 'Little bit confusing to order for first timers but great coffee!This location is super close to my friend\'s apartment and about a 5min walk to the BART station so it\'s super convenient if you want to just grab coffee on the go!The shop is spacious with plenty of seating inside and outside and it even has a shared bookshelf if you just want a new read.I got extremely confused as to how to order but I figured it out after watching others. Wish it did have instructions or a ""Order here"" sign that way it\'d be more clear but it works. You don\'t have to wait too overly long for the coffee as there\'s multiple baristas.']"

I opted to try their Yirgacheffe Pour Over ($5), which was super smooth, but had a slightly acidic finish. They roast their beans in the back of the shop, which would be cool if they did a mini tour, or had a display window or something along those lines. Beans are around $14/bag. They also had some cookies available (vegan and non), but no other food options. Parking was easy at that time, and there were good metered street parking spots. I believe there is also one free street spot on the street right before the cafe."", 'Below-the-radar artisanal coffee shop with an emphasis on single-origin coffee from Ethiopia. Their pour-overs are exceptionally well balanced, neither bitter nor acidic (a sign that the coffee extraction was just about right, neither under-extracted nor over-extracted). They roast the coffee beans themselves. The espresso we tried was from Columbia. The latte is quite smooth with an earthy/fruity profile, the kind you have come to expect from good coffee baristas. Definitely recommended if you are in the area.The only minus is that it was freaking cold in there. The building is an old warehouse of sorts, I guess not very well insulated and not well heated.

Their cappuccinos were fine but the chai latte was way too sweet. Wish they had more types of cream cheese but their onion bagel was fine. Wasn't toasted much. Service was a bit gruff but at least they were efficient. Appreciate that they were open on New Year's morning."", ""Love the atmosphere here! I have been wanting to check out this coffee shop for a while now, and finally had the pleasure to check the Beanery out this past weekend. We came on a Sunday afternoon, and it wasn't too crowded. I ordered a Chai latte, which tasted like heaven. I will say, this place is super cozy, and has a few places to sit, and is a nice place to get work done. The ladies working behind the counter on this day were super welcoming and nice. I will definitely be checking out this spot more often!!"", ""Quick Summary:- Recommend the Cafe Au Lait because one gets to personalize their coffee (you will see what I mean once you visit)- Unique coffee ordering experience- Cute decoration (the train caught my eye)- The aroma of roasted coffee beans is spectacular- We came at a right time, but a line grew while we were drinking coffee- More of a grab and go coffee place because of limited seating spaceWe were lured into the cafe by the cute coffee bean roasting train near the cafe entrance. Since we were looking for a place to sit down and drink some coffee, we decided to try here. I was first surprised and confused at the four different coffee dispensers at the area, where there are sugar and creams, and I later realized why. I ordered the cafe au lait and when the received my order, it was a cup filled with foamy milk. I probably looked dumbfounded because the cashier gestured and told me to pour coffee from the coffee dispensers. There were four different types (one being decaf), and I selected the darkest roast. The coffee was SO GOOD! My favorite type of coffee is the taste where it has no sour and bitter notes. The french roast didn't include any of these, and after I took a sip, it left a lingering toasty aftertaste. Even my relative, who can't drink coffee because they don't like the bitter taste, was able to drink a share. I was even tempted to purchase a bag of coffee beans, but that will be for the next visit."", ""Great coffee and amazing service! I got my typical almond milk latte and it was served just how I love it -- super fast, smooth, and with the perfect amount of foam. Many thanks to Ron, who took the effort to make conversation, putting a smile on my face and everyone else's. He even walked over to me to offer me the wifi password, seeing that I took out my laptop (outside!). Super considerate and super good vibes.Beautiful environment with outdoor seating. Good place to go if you can work with the usual urban background noise, as it's right next to a lot of transit. Thanks Beanery and thanks Ron for a lovely afternoon!"", ""I've become a semi regular here. The coffee is good as the roast the beans on site an if you get the house coffee, $2.25-2.75, not crazy expensive. \xa0Combine it with a pastry & you can sit & read the paper (some people still read news papers) for under $6. \xa0(Credit cards - with Apple Pay - accepted above $5).

Definitely has the hipster vibe like other reviews say. Impressions: the coffee has bold flavor and it was strong-- I felt jittery after. The location is small, so you will welcome sitting next to strangers. You will be lucky to get a seat as it was rather busy and lots of customers going in and out.

There's not as much seating in the morning, but after around 12pm there are more open tables. Good coffee, they have a lot of different roasts you can buy. The drinks also seem a little bit cheaper (cold brew was only $2.50). They have a ton of tea options too. Service is SUPER quick, i always get my drinks immediately. The space inside is a little cramped, the tables are kind of close to each other. The only downside is that there are no outlets to plug in anything, but there's free wifi! Sometimes people smoke right outside and the smoke kind of blows inside. But overall it's a very quiet and calm coffee shop!

I wanted to walk, and instead of being dismissive of the hour walk, she kindly gave me directions and also let me charge my phone. I can tell she really cares about her customers and is not one of those coffee shops who are only sweet to the regulars. Being someone in customer service, I always appreciate people like her.

I was greeted by this strong instant ramen smell. I guess big no no for that? I wish to smell coffee, not ramen?!? The vibe here also can't compare with the one on Lawton.

I then discovered avenue which is just across the street, they serve verve (not my favorite) and the vibe is much better."", ""First time to Andytown. The layout and staff is very guest friendly. Grab a coffee or specialty, sit down and relax.

We really liked the back patio seating.', 'Hipster coffee shop located a block away from Ocean Beach.Been here quite a few times and it\'s one of my favorite coffee shops in SF. Their menu is unique because they offer a drink called ""Snowy Plover"" and different variations of it. Personally I skipped it because I\'m not a fan of soda water!!My favorite go-to drink here is their Iced Mocha with their house made whip cream. Their whip cream is like crack so yummy and fluffy. I usually also ask for extra whip, a must!Prices are you average coffee shop prices raging from $4-$5 a drink. Usually spend about $10 if I\'m with my boyfriend for 2 drinks.Customer service is fast and friendly. In this location they only have outdoor seating, all the way at the back of the store. They also have a nice bathroom which is a plus.Lovely coffee shop to drop by before your day at the beach.', 'Love this place. \xa0Serves very good strong coffee. Staffs very friendly.

Will try their other drinks next time with the soda water!', ""As mentioned before, my housemate and fiancé purchased many items from here in the past but only recently had I actually ventured in and got some things. Staff are so sweet and helpful. I usually make my way here after a few mile walk and get one of their almond latte's with the brown sugar simple syrup which is very tasty and not too sweet. I still love their apple and sausage corn muffin. One of the few muffins I can still enjoy lol. Glad it's an easy pick up close to home. Gonna miss this place when I move next year. Prices are fair and I always tip. They have dog treats that for some reason my housemates dog can't stand (she's picky and SPOILED) but it's cool they have them. Totally worth checking them out if you're close by. It's nice to have something other than a bar in the neighborhood. I'm kind of annoyed at the choices for morning and afternoon fare in this area. I just wish they had more offerings. I think they'd do really great offering a simple breakfast sandwich and small lunch options since they are open as late as they are. Brownies only take me so far in life LOL"", 'Very interesting special drink...the snowy plover is unusual because of the carbonation, but tasty nonetheless. I was hasty in my ordering and picked without reading the description. My first sip was met with mixed feelings, perhaps due to my own naivety. It took me a bit to truly enjoy the drink, but ultimately, I enjoyed it. The whipped cream on top was definitely delicious. The surroundings were clean, simple, and elegant. My friend and I enjoyed the small outdoor space in the back. It was chilly and a bit damp, but the sun came out and warmed up half of the space. I would come back and love to try their matcha drink.', ""I love the vibe and service of Andytown. The coffee aromas remind me of ritual. It is the quintessential SF coffee shop complete with single brew coffees, $5 toast (mediocre), and specialty drinks (plover). I wasn't a fan of the plover which is soda water and coffee, so this time got the mocha instead. 3.5 stars for the mocha, in which you can really taste the quality chocolate. I wish it was creamier and more chocolatey though. The soda bread tastes like pita and is drenched in butter. The other sliced multigrain is also dense but looked too healthy. If you like dense toast I would instead recommend The Mill."", 'Andytown adventures in the Sunset! I had been to the Lawton location near Ocean Beach and today I decided to take a trip to the Andytown on Taraval. I decided to lose my ""snowy plover"" virginity and get this drink.

There is no seating inside. You can sit outside in the back. This coffee business is interesting, so I decided to visit. Although, I would probably visit Lawton and not Taraval more often.', 'Came here on a Saturday morning and there was a line out the door. The line moves at an okay pace, but gosh the lattes are good!

I have tried Andytown's cappuccinos, Matcha Snowy Plovers, and the Peach Corn Bread and all were delicious. Snowy Plovers are a cold drink (coffee or matcha or whatever they're serving seasonally) with a huge slab of whipped cream on top: It looks almost like a root beer float or an affogato. The whipped cream is DELICIOUS; I wanted to just eat it by the spoonful. I enjoy this coffee shop because it encourages people to sit outside and talk since there really isn't much table space to do work. It's a block away from the beach and the street is full of palm trees. Definitely recommend checking out this location or the one on Lawton!"", 'tldr: The coffee cafe serves a drink called the ""snowy plover,"" and it can be made with matcha or espresso. Get it. Very good. Mix the cream before drinking. The ""snowy plover"" drink is why people come here. The drink is carbonated water, matcha/espresso, and a chunk of sweet cream.

Great for sunny afternoons- grab your favorite coffee here, bring a book and enjoy their outside patio!', ""My husband is a huge fan of coffee and I am a huge fan of independent/local coffee establishments. We finally made it out here to try their coffee. We don't normally hang out in the outer sunset. Located a couple blocks from the beach and from the SF ZOO. Otherwise, it is basically residential and parking is not an issue. I ordered a cafe au lait and my husband ordered a regular coffee. I had cafe au lait earlier in the year in New Orleans and well obviously, this doesn't compare. The coffee is a bit acidic but better than another local coffee joint that we went to the day before. It was a chilly morning but I would have liked to try one of their plovers given how popular it is. Nice interior that is very modern and simplistic. Nice spacious sliding door unisex restroom. Outdoor seating that is more for a limited time. The seats appears moist from the fog so we opted to walk around and drink our coffee in the car. I would come back if I was ever in the area but would not come out of my way."", 'SF has always been known for coffee, but Andytown has really taken innovation of coffee up a notch. Stopped by with my girlfriend and got the infamous snowy plover. It seemed like it was made with sparkling water, shot of espresso, and topped with heavy whipping cream. After posing a few times to help my girlfriend get a nice Instagram photo of the decor, I finally got to take a sip of the drink. It was certainly different than my normal latte from Starbucks. It was very carbonated, but not too overwhelming. The buttery texture of the whipped cream was the highlight especially since we watched them whip it out freshly in front of us. It is one of those drinks that continue to grow on you and before you know it, the snowy plover was gone. I liked how they illustrated the ""bird theme"" throughout the store and it made it seem like we were just enjoying a cup of coffee right in the outdoors.']"

I don't know what is going on with all these hipster coffee shops that want to work with office hours instead of hospitality hours. Good way to do business guys. The coffee is over priced and just regular taste. The bathroom is a tech nightmare.

Way to go :(And one last thing, thr reggaeton style music doesnt help with the atmosphere."", ""Stanza is such a cute little coffee shop! The music isn't too loud, the bathroom is extremely clean (very futuristic, as many other reviewers have mentioned), and is a great place to come get some work down. The tables are big and there's plenty of seats. I ordered an iced latte, and it was perfectly creamy - maybe one of the best lattes I've ever had! The only downfall is the lack of outlets at this place. One of the walls has maybe 3 outlets, while the other wall only has 1 outlet. Make sure to bring a long extension if you come here!"", ""When I think of Stanza, I tend to consider it my secondary option for coffee if I'm in that part of the Mission. There are a lot of excellent cafes and coffee vendors in the area, and comparing Stanza to the wealth of other options makes me think it's just all right. For example, if you are looking for a workspace, the limited seating options and dim lighting makes this place not so inviting to write or read for a long time (I guess an exception would be if you are a cave dweller or a vampire who has foolishly ventured out in the daytime and need a safe space to hide out from the sun). However, the coffee is great, and I usually get my drink to go given the space limitations. My most recent drink was a cortado, and I thought it was well-made; Americanos here have also not disappointed. However, Four Barrel would probably be my preferred coffee option if I'm in the area."", ""Nice quiet place to get some work done.. you can order food from the Mediterranean restaurant next door which is a solid plus.

They do have long tables though in case you needed to spread out and it never got super busy, so you didn't feel guilty for staying a little while.

They do accept Apple Pay here which is really convenient for me. I believe they also roast their own coffee on site and you can smell the great coffee aroma once you enter.

And many of the shops in SF overprice their beans or advertise a pound when they really sell it in 10-12oz quantities, lame. But behold!! We loved the beans we got from here AND it's actually a full 16ozThe female cashier was really informative about the pour overs and helped us picked 2 different ones, both of which we loved. We ended up getting a bag of their Gypsy(?) bean and have been doing our own pour overs at home. I'm wondering if our ratio is right though, we'll definitely need to ask next time. Also! Each bag purchase comes with a free brewed coffee I believe. The shop itself is small but we were lucky to grab 2 seats, they also have a variety of coffee gear to sellExcited to stop by again in a couple weeks to try a new bean~"", ""Wow, would not normally review for a single visit, but the latte was remarkable.

I would definitely come back to try their other drinks if I'm ever in the neighborhood again.I really appreciate the vibe of the store as well. You can see the roasting machine from the front, and the character of the operating family really comes through in their decor and design (recently renovated?) --- clean and modern."", ""First timer here and left very satisfied. Usually, when I have lunch in the Sunset District, I go to my usual tea spot, but my friend recommended we stop for coffee instead at Henry's.

Some places just cannot get it right. My friend went for the cold brew and also tasted great.Love that it's a family run shop. I read more on their website about how they got started and I think it's great that father and son are working together on this. I heard it's newly renovated.

Cafe St. Jorge,"[""One of my favorite spots in the city! A very cute Portuguese style cafe with good coffee and even better food. My favorite things to get are the breakfast board, banana bread, the chia bowl, and my guilty pleasure - a mimosa! The breakfast board comes on a chopping board with a few slices of ham, a warmed baguette, softened butter, and Portuguese cheese (I don't know my cheeses, but I'd say it tastes like a creamier Parmesan). For $7 it's quite filling, though the only downside is you have the slice the baguette yourself, which is a real arm workout since we were only provided with a butter knife. The banana bread warmed up is amazing, especially with the warmed butter it comes with. They're also quite generous with the mimosa, filled to the brim for $7! Check this place out if you're looking for a chill cafe in the Mission. It's a good place to spend a few hours studying at as well since there are outlets on both sides of the wall! No laptops until 2PM on the outlet tables on weekends though!"", ""I have a Sunday ritual of visiting a different coffee shop every weekend and enjoying an Americano and a good lunch.

Well because I'm not an expert, but what I do know about is the above topics. Food: 5They have a tasty variety of options that range from small bites like a toast or for larger appetites they have sandwiches and salads. I had the avocado toast which was good, fresh, and I liked the chili oil that was drizzled on top too. I had been here once before, and I'm pretty sure I got a salad and was happy with that also.Ambiance: 4This cafe was so cute and bright. Plenty of seating and plugs along the walls. There wasn't anything super special about it, but I was comfortable, and the natural light is critical. They did have a little bit of a fly issue... but they flew pretty high that they weren't a real bother. Staff was friendly didn't go much out of their way, but helpful when asked.

We've had it with the gluten-free sourdough as well, and it's a little smaller but yummy! -- Orange Blossom Waffle // A vegan waffle with real maple syrup, we usually add the fruit for $3 and it's totally worth it (check out the photo). It's a beautiful presentation and nice amount of fruit that really bump it up to an actual breakfast. We've also tried a few of the vegan pastries, like the Nutella muffin and coffee cakes, all of which have been very tasty. Looking forward to trying their chia pudding and other offerings soon.

She actually did a very good job reviewing this place for the both of us, so I\'ll keep the rest short.Yes, they don\'t offer vegan matcha lattes, they should consider adding these to their menu since match is exploding in popularity these days. Moreover, while they offered a number of vegan baked goods, I found them to be average.I\'d work from this cafe again if I\'m in the area, but I wouldn\'t go out of my way to do so since they only offer tea and no tea lattes.', 'I recently traveled to Portugal for a few weeks and was blown away by the delicious food.

The café is so cute! It definitely had a European feel. And the breakfast was amazing! Of course the egg tarts were not as good as the one directly from Portugal, but they were one of the best ones I have had here in the US. This is a secret gem!', ""This cafe is wonderful!

My favorites include:- Chia bowl w/homemade granola: light, sweet, tasty.- Orange blossom waffle w/fruits: visually pretty and yummy- The goose is loose: sweet and savory, a little heavier, good for lunch and you can get it with a side salad- Baked egg breakfast slider: savory and a little sweet, small portion"", ""One of my favorite cafés in the City.

I also wanted a place that had at least some vegan food since I hadn't eaten breakfast yet. This place seemed to fit all of those criteria and had a high rating, so I recommended that we go here. This place is located in Bernal Heights and street parking is free on Sundays, but you will likely still have to park a couple blocks away and walk. They don't have matcha lattes here if that is your drink and while they serve Stumptown Coffee, my mocha turned out so bad it was practically undrinkable. While they had clearly marked vegan options on their menu, most of them where on the sweeter side and I prefer savory vegan breakfast a lot more. For food my friend ordered a vegan blueberry muffin and I ordered avocado toast and vegan banana bread (which they ran out of and I switched to chai coffee cake). My avocado toast was good, but nothing I would go out of my way to seek out again and the coffee cake was just okay too. Really if the coffee sucks, it's pretty much impossible for me to give higher than a 3 star review.

BUMMER.As the day progressed and we celebrated our grandma\'s birthday, which was what we initially came to SF for that day, we discovered that there was another SF location that might be more convenient...Fillmore!The parking game, though still not the best, was much better near the Fillmore location (I don\'t want to emphasize the ""much better"" cause how much better can parking in SF get?).First off, the streets weren\'t as confusing as Mint St. Secondly, the walk down Fillmore St is a must for those visiting SF. There are so many little stores and eateries along the way. Note: The walk contains quite a few slopes, so I would advise those who might have difficulty with such walks to just drive.Back to Blue Bottle: The Blue Bottle on Fillmore is located on a street corner (it\'s quite visible). It\'s super clean and simple inside. There is absolutely no clutter, and there are light-colored wooden tables spread out in the vicinity. It\'s pretty bright inside both from the natural light coming through the windows as well as the artificial lights inside. Plus, they have a great selection of music (ahem...Lauryn Hill...Yuna...I repeat...GREAT).The menu, much like the place, is simple. There are a few varieties of drip coffees but everything else only has one option (e.g, there is just one ""caffe Latte"" or one ""caffe mocha""). We were discussing this, but it\'s interesting and great that although the quality of Blue Bottle Coffee is known for being excellent, the price for a cup of coffee doesn\'t differ much from that of chains like Starbucks or Peet\'s (except for the Affogato-ice cream in coffee...oh my gosh, I need to get this next time, but it\'s like 600 calories, and it is close to $6).I ordered the Caffe Latte (which came with a pretty design), and the best way I would describe it is that it is ""whole."" There was a deep taste (richness) without being overwhelming (thanks to both the froth and the quality of the Latte itself). I do think it had too much foam/creaminess on top-it took a little while to get to the liquid).I also got to try my sister\'s Cascara Fizz (a lemony-sweet soda). Wow, I really enjoyed it. It had just the right amount of sweetness and tartness. Even the sparkling water they used was not harsh on the throat (a more diluted version)? It was a bit pricy for the $4ish we paid though. Without the ice cubes, the drink probably amounted to less than 8 oz.The customer service was okay. The guys were professional in that they answered our questions and got our drinks right, but it was decent-no complaints. They did their job without any frills. Anyways, my experience at Blue Bottle (and the adventure getting there) was a memorable one. So here\'s four stars!', 'Waffles and soy cappuccino are to die for. Unfortunately, the soy part got discontinued, and oatmeal milk is not my favorite.', ""*8/6 Update*: Added a star because of a kind note from the manager regarding my experience.A respectable coffee shop at the corner of Fillmore and Jackson. The interior decor was contemporary and felt comfortable. The New Orleans iced coffee was quite good. 3-stars are for the amenities and atmosphere inside. Ever since Blue Bottle Coffee was acquired by Nestle for $700M, I've wanted to swing by to see what this new concept was about. This was my first Blue Bottle experience because I happened to be in the neighborhood. I did not come with high expectations. My thinking was that unless you're a coffee connoisseur, you would likely miss the hype train that everyone else had been on. I was gladly proven wrong regarding this point. The iced-coffee here was noticeably better than any other iced I've had in a while. The perfect amount of sweetness with a smooth finish. I was very happy with this order. The location itself leaves a bit to be wanting. There was no WiFi (!) in the shop. I understand faster table turnover is an important business metric, but this may be trying a little too hard. The baristas sometimes don't seem to have that much attention to detail either. I was sitting next to a table of empty mugs with some liquid spilled on it. The barista came over, took away the mugs, and didn't look back at wiping the stain. 3/5."", 'Disclaimer: non-coffee drinker here.But when I first noticed that blue bottle was opening in the neighborhood, all I could think of was ""open, open, open!""Sure, call me a groupie, but I can\'t resist jumping on the third wave coffee bandwagon. Granted, the cheapest cup of Joe is $3.75 (Single origin, made one cup at a time, yadda, yadda) and their TCHO laced mocha drink clocks in at $4.75, BB is pricey. And of course, when the barista smiles at you, that\'s an least an extra $1! I usually get a decaf Americano or decaf iced latte (decaf -- A waste of time AND money! don\'t do it!) i try it first without putting all that garbage (sugar and milk) and declare it delicious. But then, I can\'t handle the bitter taste so I augment my coffee to the point that my $3.75 cup tastes like a sugary mess. AAAHHHH. Like I said, non-coffee drinker here. I should just stick to their iced cascara fizz next time.', ""Doesn't live up to the hype. \xa0Cappuccino was small and expensive and just tasted okay. \xa0Too many great places for coffee in the City to settle for okay."", '1 person in front of me in line, I then ordered 3 drinks. 20 mins still waiting. Soooooo not worth it.', 'A cozy and very comfortable store. I like the location of this blue bottle. I had a caffe mocha, it tasted great and really smooth.', ""Cashier who took order was not friendly. Cappuccino is served in a small cup. Way too much milk for a cap. With the amount of milk they included, coffee was too milky and tasted more like a latte. Place was noisy and didn't feel like a place that I wanted to stay in. Quickly sat up and left to get some peace. Their music was also way too loud for 730am on Saturday. It's over priced but taste of coffee was good simply too much milk for a cap. Might go back to try a dry cap but for an everyday spot. I don't mind paying a high price but would expect a delicious true cap not a mini petite latte."", 'I\'ve never had a bad experience at a Blue bottle before until now :/ I wasn\'t too impressed with their service today. I ordered a NOLA and an iced latte and they messed up my order. They ""accidentally"" forgot my order after I patiently waited for 10 minutes and then they rushed to make my coffee and the NOLA taste was off. It didn\'t taste the same and the chicory was overpowering. Not the best blue bottle cafe and they need to work out the kinks in their communication.', ""REVIEWER # 12I've experienced the Blue Bottle Coffee near Market and near the Twitter Building; for the most part, I enjoy it and love that the space is always kept clean. Customer service is always flawless, and everyone is very accommodating. \xa0I was happy to see that another Blue Bottle Coffee opened right in the Fillmore area, trust me-it is needed. I'm sure many people get tired of seeing the same ol' Pete's Coffee and Starbucks. Blue Bottle Coffee makes drinking coffee more exciting. This new location recently opened in June 2017 and has everyone excited over the grand opening. As from what I notice, there are no discounts or specials happening. The location is very spacious and as of now, there is no signage located outside indicating the name of the business or announcing the grand opening. I literally only found out because I walked pasted it during the Fillmore Festival. The interior of this location is different from other locations. There is natural light that comes through the windows, but it reminds me of a retail store. It's not as welcoming as I would expect. I love that this location serves the Waffle and Avocado Toast! OMG, you must try one if you are here! Overall, a great place to stop for the coffee feens. It's much tastier then the normal Starbucks and Peet's Coffee."", 'So excited about having a Blue Bottle in the neighborhood. So excited in fact that I went there twice in one day. There\'s a saying in German that literally translates to ""it\'s hard to stand on one only leg"" and figuratively serves as the justification for the second beer/wine/jello shot. I believe this also very true for coffee in general and the Blue Bottle New Orleans in particular. I\'ve been raving about this one on several other occasions/locations throughout the city, and the lovestory continues in the Pac Heights location. Creamy, icy, lightly sweet deliciousness in a glass! More to love about this location: spacious interior, pretty minimalistic, but not too cool. Waffles and Avocado toast on the menu. Lots of coffee gear to check out and wonder about how great they would look in your own kitchen. And of course all the different grinds and blends for your own coffee maker of choice. I like the little packages that serve 1, great to try different blends without committing to a whole bag. Chances are high that you\'ll find me here more often than my wallet allows.', 'I am definitely missing something here. I stopped in with a group while in town on business. I even went to their website afterwards to see what all the hub bub was about. Still no clue. I had a coffee and a waffle, OK, so what. Still no comparison to my fresh roasted extra dark french roast via the moka pot at home.']"
Samovar Tea - Yerba Buena Gardens,"['It is really to to be here to have a brunch during a sunny day. Sunshine make everything beautiful! We ordered a bunch of food! I tried the following:Smoked duck hash: really good, I love the combination of poached egg, potato, and smoked duck. For the bread, it is not crispy enough and not very flavorfulSquash dumpling: nice and cute dumpling, not good not bad. Can not taste much squash flavorShared cheese: I think this combination is really good for a group start. Love the honey comb', 'I love the location of Samovar and the food and drinks are pretty good, but I\'m growing frustrated by the deceptive pricing and hidden fees.First, I have found on three different occasions that the price on my receipt was higher than the price on the menu. \xa0For instance, the Cold Brew Matcha is $7 on the menu, but is $8 on the bill. \xa0They are always shocked when I highlight these discrepancies and only fix it with a one-time discount on the bill - they don\'t seem to fix the POS.Second, they charge an ""SF Employer Mandate,"" as so many restaurants do. \xa0As you hopefully know now, this is not a real tax and restaurants charge an arbitrary amount to cover costs to comply with the new law requiring businesses with over 20 employees to provide healthcare for employees. Samovar charges 5% of the bill, which is far more than would be required to comply with the $1.89 per employee hour for healthcare.Third, they now also charge an additional mysterious ""Back of House Service Fee"" which is 4% of the total bill. It\'s unclear what this money goes towards, but presumably compensation for the cooks and cleaning staff. \xa0But shouldn\'t that come out of the revenues? Or the tip?Don\'t get me wrong - I\'m strongly supportive of increasing the wages for restaurant workers. But I would much prefer that the restaurant raise prices than add these hidden charges to the menu. And charging more on the bill than the menu for items is just unethical and illegal.', ""Samovar once was a great tea shop near Dolores park. Like so much of post tech sf, it's gone way down in quality and way up in prices. Today - the final straw - I come to a nearly empty place and am told I can't sit for tea until my friend arrives! Sabrina was very nice, and said it was what she was trained to do. I was quite bothered but take her at her word that Jesse (the owner though she didn't mention his name) must have wanted that. Some of the tea is still very good like the blood orange puer and \xa0the incomparable green ecstasy (sencha snd matcha). But even that has gone downhill from the original preparation and now quite bitter. If you buy the tea leaves, the instructions are often way wrong - like the green ecstasy should be cold brewed then ten seconds in 185 water - not two minutes boiling! The tempeh is great fir vegetarian but sickly sweet. Other nice dishes are the Japanese tea service. Once the tech bubble bursts, I imagine the shop will regroup and go back to its previous quality. In the meantime, buy Japanese tea as asakichi in Japan town. The matcha is much cheaper and much better. I buy the very best orange dot but it's the priciest. Jesse, please bring back the old samovar standards"", ""One of the prettiest cafes/brunch places I've been to in SF! The food is unique and delicious as well. Perfect for a not-so-heavy brunch on a nice day.I came here on Sunday at noon and there weren't that many people there so we got seated right away. The restaurant has massive windows with a lot of sunlight and super nicely decorated. The staff were all really nice and attentive. We got the duck & egg jook, the smoked duck hash, the chia seed pudding, and the chai. The smoked duck they use in the jook and hash is so good, and I'm not even a fan of duck, but it was like bacon but better and not oily. I might try something else when I go next time though, because I wasn't like coo coo for coco puffs for the jook or hash. The chia seed pudding and chai were amazing though - definitely will get those every time I go.This is a great place for conversation over a casual brunch where you don't have to wait in crazy long lines. And also it's just so pretty I was shook. If I didn't look so crusty when I went, I would've taken an instagram there or something. Next time though!"", ""The sparkling matcha limeade was a beautiful, unexpected explosion of complex flavor in a drink that's made of seemingly contradictory components. The sparkling limeade component towards the top of the drink gives a very refreshing and cool taste, whereas the heavier matcha component that sinks to the bottom provides a sweet, earthy, and full contrast. Beautifully crafted tea cocktail. The building is very pretty with lots of natural light as well. The service could be improved, and the prices could be lower."", 'This location of the samovar tea bar has a beautiful interior and exterior with open space, high ceilings, natural light and plants. This is a good place for afternoon tea if you want to get together with friends or if you want a relaxing place to study/get work done. The food and tea were pretty disappointing. I got the earl grey tea smoked chicken sandwich and I couldn\'t taste the earl grey tea at all. The the chicken salad was very salty and there was nothing too special about it. I wouldn\'t recommend this sandwich. I also got the vintage 2009 tea which was $15. The description of the tea was ""dark chocolate, caramel, pecan pie"" so I thought the tea would be sweet. It is definitely not a sweet tea. It tasted more like an herbal tea if anything. So if you want a sweet tea, I suggest trying something else! Overall, I think the atmosphere and interior is very well designed. You immediately feel calm and relaxed in the space. The food and drink, however, was very disappointing (considering the price as well).', ""This is the 2nd time I've visited Samovar Tea. My first visit was really good. The location is very pretty and the ambiance is a 5/5. I love the tea selections. Highly recommend the Masala Chai for the Hot Tea. The food was simple and tasty. Do note most of the portions are small. The price can be a bit steep.For my 2nd visit, the service was a 3/5. It took awhile before we got seated but that's okay since it can be busy after work hours. It took quite sometimes until they took our orders, probably after 15 minutes. Unfortunately, \xa0lady staff kept passing by us and I wasn't completely sure if she was just ignoring us too, I had to call the attention of the other server who was all the way on the other side. The gentleman that took our order was really pleasant which made up for it a bit."", ""Overall, I'm disappointed in the service my friends and I received while dining here for Sunday brunch. First, when I asked what was vegan on the menu. The waitress just mentioned the sandwich and nothing else, which didn't give me many options. Then after ordering, I was served a cold tea when I asked for it hot, and the waitress snapped at me when I asked about getting the hot version, saying that was why she asked me if I wanted iced or hot. I'm 100% sure I said hot when she asked for clarification and my friends agree. When my friends asked for more butter for their toast, it took quite a while before it came.The whole time I felt very unwelcome dining here, which is very unfortunate since we were looking forward to the event. I had heard that the place is pretty vegan friendly but I'd say the options are pretty minimal. None of the brunch menu was vegan I think. Some vegan options were labeled as vegetarian (I had to ask for clarification), which was pretty confusing. I appreciate that the menu has pretty healthy options with simple ingredients and that there are many tea options for tea-lovers. If I ever go back again, I hope the service can be improved and the menu can consider adding some more creative vegan options!"", ""Thoroughly impressed.Few things first, we got here fairly early, before any morning rush - at 9AM during the trade show Photonics West.I'm a regular to SF, but didn't know about this hidden gem.It's up at the top of the walk way in the Yerba Buena Garden, right next to the Metreon.Ambience:5/5This place is amazing.

The food is simple, but Samovar delivers what is promised flawlessly and full of interesting flavors.The tea was delicious as well although I wish there was an option for tea flights so that we could have tried a larger variation.

Things were also a bit rushed when it came to ordering and paying the bill. We were given the check before I even finished half of my tea and I didn't understand the rush because there was no line and plenty of open tables. So yeah, service wasn't great and our waiter didn't really check up on us. Food (3/5): Presentation-wise, the food looked great. I ordered the Jook with duck and eggs, because I had seen other order it on Yelp and was excited to get some flavorful duck and rice porridge. However, I found the dish to be quite bland. There wasn't much seasoning in the porridge (even with the addition of the sauce on the side) and the duck. My friends got the smoked duck hash and eggs benefits and also said that their food was underseasoned. So overall the food was underwhelming. Drinks (4/5): I got the velvet cacao because the tea I was originally going to get (a blood orange flavored one) was out and the waiter recommended this. It was fine - a bit bitter towards the end if you let the leaves soak too long. It had a nice faint cacao taste but it wasn't anything mind-blowing good. Setting (4/5): The space was nice and well lit. There was plenty of seating with both indoors and out."", ""Ok I love the location of Samovar, the look of Samovar and its setup. I also love the variety of teas that Samovar has and appreciate that they pair the teas with meals. BUT I think the value of the food is not worth the price at all. My SO and I ordered the California rose and Japanese sencha teas and enjoyed the teas very much. However, the potstickers, vegan roll and sandwich were underwhelming in both flavor and capacity. Of course, the lightness of the food goes well with tea-- you want smaller foods to truly appreciate the taste and texture of the tea. But I just don't get the pricing or the value of it. I'd come back for the tea for sure, but probably eat elsewhere."", 'A good place to go for tea service with the big floor to ceiling window panes.

Salmon + egg bowl ($13): This too was unseasoned and came with soy sauce to add in. We added some avocado too. I recommend drizzling some in to add more flavor to the salmon.

There were five of us and we stood awkwardly at the counter while people who came in after us were served right away; I made eye contact a couple of times with a woman who appeared to be the one in charge, but she blatantly ignored us and the message in her eyes was clear: get out if you're not spending $$$$.

They had the ricotta & pistachio toast, which isn't something you can find at all the locations that serve food (not all locations have toast/food selections other than what you see in the bakery display case)!! The ricotta & pistachio toast was kinda missing something?? It was served on Starter Bakery bread and came with honey and sea salt, but it kinda lacked the flavor I was expecting?? It was tasty with a hint of sweet and salty that complemented each other nicely, but I think I'm going to stick to my usual: avocado toast with no eggThey had a creamy hazelnut toast on the menu, but I didn't see it in the display case, so I asked if they were still serving it, and the worker said they ran out of hazelnuts and that they stopped because it wasn't super popular :( I also saw a few energy bowl options!! Hella rad!!Bottom line: Love this location!! The workers are super friendly, and there's tons of space if you're looking for a place to work. I'm a HUGEEE sucker for those cute little hip local third wave coffee shops with ambiguous names that leave much room for interpretation (SF's specialty!!!!!!!), but Philz will always be #1 in my heart"", ""The consistency doesn't drop here, like all the other Philz in the area this place doesn't let you down for the perfect cup of coffee. All menu options are the same as the other locations and the coffee is always handmade by the delicious cup.

The staff here are friendly and welcoming and if you're in the neighborhood with a itch for coffee/tea this place will get you right"", ""Philz Coffee in dogpatch is a staple of this industrial neighborhood. The space has an open floor plan with high ceilings, well lit and plenty of workspace. It's typical to see several people working on their laptops and reading books at Philz. In addition to the wonderful workspace, wifi and kind staff members, the coffee is INCREDIBLE!!!!For the coffee snob that is into PURE black coffee, Philz will not disappoint the highly developed palate of yours. My go-to is Aromatic Arabic. A darker blend with tones of walnut and a smokiness to it. No cream, no sugar needed. Just a good cup of coffee to get the caffeine surge you need for work, and wonderful taste to keep your soul happy. In addition, the breakfast burritos, banana nut bread and complementary cucumber water are frosting on the wonderful (coffee) cake that is Philz. Bottom Line: Best coffee in San Francisco."", 'Unfortunately and unnecessarily long process. Spent 15 minutes waiting on a small coffee and it wasn\'t busy.

I have travelled extensively both domestically and internationally, and I can confidently endorse Philz as one of the best coffees I have had . . . ever. Their extensive list of 20+ choices is more like a wine list than a coffee shop touting their one or two daily roasts. And with each cup individually ground and brewed when you order you always know you're getting a fresh cup. Staff are friendly, and I loved that they're not a bunch of coffee snobs. They simply brew world-class coffee. Enough said. If you've not yet tried Philz, you're missing a wonderful cup of joe. Enjoy!"", ""I am your biggest fan!

The error prevented me from buying a handful of times, but I decided to call the actual store to see there was something they can do from their end.Someone picked up and addressed my concern about the order.

I've had their sea salt chocolate chip cookie, croissant, travel cakes, and other pastries, and would honestly recommend all of them! One pastry ranges from $3-$5 while the cakes can get expensive at $8 a slice. They also have loaves of Japanese milk bread here for purchase. There's seating inside for maybe 20-30 and also a bathroom that doesn't require a code or purchase, which is neat. However, this is also why I've noticed a huge line for the bathroom any time I've come in."", ""Such a good place to get an array of pastries. I went here on a Saturday morning, and it was very busy. I know why though, it's because their pastries are so delicious.The ambience is super cute. A great place to have a first aid, to catch up with friends, to have a small casual brunch, or to just sit down have a great cuppa coffee and have some alone time. The decor is super cute and super modern. Which means clean aesthetics.I opted for the latte with almond milk, and let's just say the coffee here is super strong. Which means that it's a really good bang for your buck when you're looking for a good cuppa coffee that's worth the money."", ""Came here for an afternoon delight... Not that kind of delight. Tried one of their pastries and a refreshing peach ice tea, both of which were awesome. Returned again on another day and tried their passion fruit, vanilla, praline dessert and it was so dang good.

I have yet to try any of the sweets on their counter, but everything looks fantastic!ProTip: 10% off if you check in on Yelp', ""This is my favorite pastry to get I go there all the time but for some reason today the size of this kouign amann is like half the size of its normal size and it's already 5 bucks. So disappointed"", ""Egg in muffin?? Revolutionary. Cut the Rebel in half and revel in the ooey gooey egg perfection. It came piping hot and fresh and ok I was truly excited for this moment more than the average person would be but it was nothing short of great. The muffin was delicious, cheesy and savory, but had the perfect texture to contain the egg and soak the yolk up as well. My only downside was that it was too filling and I had to stop myself. Latte was delicious and the perfect company to breakfast. Their pastry case was full of yummy interesting goods that I will have to try one day if I could ever turn down the Rebel. But that's for another day. Ambiance is nice, but it kinda smells like hipster wood like some lumberjack cologne, but I guess that's part of the vibe of ~craftsman and wolves~."", ""This was stop #2 on a self-directed coffee/walking tour of SF and I had a delicious cappuccino here. The space was SO cute - I was taking photos of the decor and space and planning how I could incorporate it into my house as soon as I returned to SEA. The pastries were all super beautiful so I had to get one as well. I should have got something different but I was pulled in by the pretty round cake like things (I don't even know what they're called) that was decorated beautifully. It was good, but not great, and a little hard to eat. The base (crust?) tasted a bit stale and I wasn't even mad when it fell off the bottom of the creamy part.

Craftsman and Wolves is probably my favorite bakery in SF - if only it weren't so darned $$$! Good thing there's a 10% Yelp check-in promo for first-timers. ;) The atmosphere here is city bourgois trying to be a little more down to earth, literally, with gnarled tree branches holding up light cords and wolves staring out from posters for D&D meet-ups (yes, that's a thing here). The main attractions seem to be their Stone ($9) and Satellite pastries ($ugh don't even look), as curious as the name suggests, an aesthetically pleasing dessert of firm outer shell, soft and deliciously flavored filling, nestled on a bed of nuts and granola. The flavors change every so often, but I haven't been disappointed yet!If you have the willpower to look away, be sure to check out their other pastries, all delightful and unique. Their seasonal Alfajores Kougin Amann filled with Dulce de Leche ($5) is crunchy, flaky, and just the right amount of sweet. For those with time and money to whittle away plus a stomach to fill, their all-day breakfast menu seems equally appetizing. Regret not getting something while in store? For better or for worse, you can order pretty much everything on the menu via Caviar. But there's definitely an upcharge. Craftsman and Wolves seems equally loved by Insta-foodies and nerds, and what both these groups share in common, besides living off of craft beer and coffee, is their attraction to places with Wi-Fi. And while it's not always the most work-friendly environment, with limited outlets and periodic bursts of people coming through, the drinks are very affordable, whether it's a shot of espresso or bottle o' beer to lubricate the mind."", ""Is paying $8 for a muffin encasing a poached egg a bit much?

It was flakey and good but nothing spectacular.The rebel was good and a different kind of muffin. Its savory with a runny egg inside. Definitely a popular item.

""The Rebel Within"" is incredibly expensive for a pastry, but wow... it\'s (unfortunately) totally worth it. It comes out warm, it\'s surprisingly savory and the egg is always cooked perfectly (my preference for eggs is always slightly runny, so I\'m always very pleased with the texture of the egg inside). The pickled carrots (that\'s what I\'m assuming they are) actually balance out the pastry incredibly well because it is a tad on the salty side, and it\'s got sausage in it so it\'s a bit heavy. I wasn\'t a huge fan of the coffee here, I thought the mocha was too sweet (or maybe I\'m just used to the dandelion mocha at Ritual) but I highly recommend coming here and at least trying their famous muffin with an egg in it if you\'ve never been before. Maybe it\'s not that hard (or maybe it is) but I\'m so impressed with the perfect composure of the egg and perplexed by how they did it that I sit there trying to figure it out (instead of looking it up, which would probably be easy) every single time.', ""These guys are true craftsmen; they charge ridiculously high prices for ridiculously designed culinary masterpieces. I've never had a cake taste so good before. Bought the satellite cake for my dad's birthday and they got the lettering done in a day!

To my surprise, while the sleek design and expertly decorated pastries caught my eye, I did not leave feeling very impressed with the quality of the baked goods I tried. Part of my dissatisfaction is that I think other bakeries in the Bay have spoiled me. Stop any local resident with a sweet tooth who lacks an aversion to carbs, and they can probably name at least 3 bakeries that consistently put out excellent croissants or other typical patisserie fare. I think my mistake with Craftsman and Wolves is that I did not try their striking tarts and went for simple items like their donut holes and morning bun (it's also possible that these items lose their freshness later in the day). Both visits left me feeling just all right, and I felt that service was scattered when the line was busy. The Americano I tried was good, though this would not be my go-to place for coffee if I was in the area (especially since Four Barrel is not that far away)."", ""Wow very cute place and Instagram-popular desserts.

Breadbelly,"[""Inconspicuously tucked away in the Richmond district is this delicious coffee and pastry shop. Looking for parking on the weekend is rough but if you're willing to walk a couple blocks it's not too bad by Park Presidio for free street parking. Clean, modern atmosphere. Order at counter and grab a seat at the table. Pricing is comparable to any good coffee/pastry shop in the city like Mr. Holmes. Had the Iced 50/50 and kaya toast. The drink is delicious , half coffee and half black tea sweetened with condensed milk. Reminded me of Hong Kong milk tea, flavor was perfect not too overwhelming and definitely refreshing . I had to google what kaya meant since I never heard of it, apparently it's a popular Singaporean item. It's made with pandan and coconut milk - very smooth and not too sweet. Bread was crispy on the edges and soft on the inside. Yummy! Will have to go back and try other items in the future."", ""Great Service and even more delicious treats.Got the following items: instagram.com/p/BwoDj7Bh…The Kaya Toast is probably what's everything to rave, colorful, instagram friendly, and delicious.My only hang up on this place is, I wish the seating was a bit more comfortable and a bit more outlets.

It's UH-MAZING!!! 2) Char Siu Sandwich with their glazed sauce and roasted pork was delicious an great to share with others. 3) Anko sticky bun was so so for me. My least favorites. 4) Cucumber and avocado salad had great texture & crunch. 5) Friendly and accommodating staff. Definitely will come back to try other things on their menu. I hope you give this lovely place a try. Cheers! The simple things in life."", 'I\'ve been to Breadbelly a couple of times, and the food is really good, and really pretty. I can see why it\'s popular with those who are active on Instagram. The food they offer is Asian-influenced. I really like the pandan toast, which is a coconut spread. Pandan is popular in the Philippines. Because it\'s a vibrant green, it\'s really pretty in pictures. Another delicious snack offered is their curry, which a fried dumpling with chicken curry inside. I\'ve also tried their sticky bun, butter mochi, and the ham/cheese ensaymada. Out of the three, I really enjoyed the ensaymada. The cheese and ham are sprinkled throughout the pastry, so you don\'t miss out on any ingredient with each bite. The sticky bun was good too, preferably warm. \xa0I didn\'t like the butter mochi much. Since the space is small, it gets crowded fast. When I wanted to dine in, the employee said I could ask one of the single diners if they don\'t mind sharing a table. I was eyeing a table to ask, but after I paid, that diner left. The women next to that table took it, and said their friend was sitting there. So I ended up eating at one of the small counters they have where you have to stand. By the time I was done with my ensaymada, their ""friend"" still hadn\'t shown up. \xa0Most of their patrons are locals, who definitely take their time, which is fine. But I find the rest of their patrons, tbh, annoying, and so I plan on going back very early in the morning to avoid the crowd, and to get a table.However, the employees are very, very nice! They\'re very welcoming and are happy to talk to you about the menu and answer any questions you have. They are pricey, but it\'s high quality and you shouldn\'t miss out.', ""I wasn't expecting the kaya toast to be anything special, but it was amazingly. I don't usually like kaya Toast because it's so sweet, but breadbelly's kaya Toast paired with unsweetened coffee is perfect. The bread was so fluffy and buttery. The coffee was strong and had a nice dark roast. The place is a little small with limited seating but if you go on a weekday you should be fine."", ""I'm a big fan of Asian pastries and when I found out that Breadbelly was finally opening their own restaurant/cafe, I HAD to go. What originally caught my attention was their Kaya Toast. I absolutely love pandan flavored anything and kaya is pandan in a sweet spreadable form. The fact that it was spread atop a fluffy piece of toasted brioche bread sold me. I wanted it. I also wanted to try their porridge but my friends were against eating at Breadbelly for lunch since the lunch menu is limited and on the pricier side for the portion size. So... we settled on ordering almost every pastry :) Kaya Toast: Fluffy brioche topped with a THICK layer of kaya jam. While it was delicious, it was extremely sweet and definitely something to share with others. Aesthetically it looked great!Not Ube Tart: Maybe my favorite! Not surprised since there's purple sweet potato inside. The tart crust was buttery and flakey, the sweet potato filling wasn't too sweet, and the meringue + salted egg yolk shavings added lightness to the pastry. Good use of textures and flavors!Brown Butter Mochi: Chewy like mochi, dense, and of course, buttery. It was good but I wouldn't get it again. If you like butter mochi or haven't had it before, try it!Ham and Cheese Ensaymada: My least favorite and only because I'm not a fan of savory pastries. My bf liked it, I think it was his favorite. I recommend it if you like savory pastries and think the flavor combo is interesting. Choco-Soba Ko-Cookie: Tied for favorite with the Not Ube Tart. I know it looks like a double chocolate chip cookie but it's different! I believe it's made using buckwheat flour (soba), making it a little earthier and sososo good! I would definitely get this again. Persimmon Satsuma Almond Cookie: The cookie base is a butter/shortbread book probably made using almond flour/almond extract? I really enjoyed the dried persimmon in the center. Kinda like thumbprint cookies! Not a must order but still worth trying. It makes me so happy when new bakeries pop up making traditional Asian pastries/flavors more appealing to people who might not have tried these flavors before. The pastry chefs at Breadbelly make their creations tasty and flavorful and combine flavors that aren't typically combined and they become pretty pieces of edible art. I'm a fan! And I'll be back to try their non-pastry items :)"", 'The kaya toast is wonderfully fluffy, served warm, and is ""not too sweet"" when you get the right ratio of coconut pandan jam in each bite :) I enjoyed the not-ube-tart but wouldn\'t go out of my way to get it again; I ordered it knowing full and well that I wanted taro, not purple yam, but then again... it\'s in the name.Really friendly service. I appreciate the option of coffee or beer - it\'s kind of hard to find a cafe/bakeshop type of place that\'ll serve alcohol, so Breadbelly really hits the mark. Perfect for breakfast, brunch, or just a snack. It looks like the neighborhood\'s welcomed Breadbelly with open arms, as there\'s a line out the door in the mornings. When I\'ve stopped by around 1:30pm or so on the weekends, there\'s hardly a wait and plenty of tables to choose from.My favorite things, hands down, are the savory options. The breakfast sandwiches are fantastic! I like the char siu sandwich (so tasty, with homemade bread), but the price point comes in a little too high for what I feel like I can satisfy at dim sum.', ""Finally, kaya toast makes it to SF! I'm a huge fan of kaya (been eating homemade kaya toast since I was a kid) and so was initially skeptical of the toast at Breadbelly. It looks a little neon green, but it's surprisingly delicious. The bread is thick, soft, and slightly salted--and the kaya is sweet. For anyone who doesn't know what kaya is, it's basically a delicious, dessert-like coconut and pandan paste. I'd definitely recommend trying it at Breadbelly!I also tried the sesame horchata, which tasted like black sesame milk with some cinnamon on top. Next time, I'll be back to try the brown sugar mochi with peanuts. Cute interior, too! Lots of natural lighting, hipster cafe-like vibes."", 'It\'s great to see a pop-up gain such a following that it goes bricks-and-mortar. Breadbelly\'s founders bring Michelin-starred experience to their new venture, where they serve Asian-inspired pastries and baked goods that are not only packed with unique, interesting flavors, but are also perfect for Instagramming or other food p*rn purposes. The ""not ube"" tart, while quite petite, was dense and subtly flavorful enough to leave a sophisticated impression. The gyeran bbang (sweet corn bread with Korean chili, cheese, soft egg), while also petite, was a slightly more savory way to ease into the morning.None of the flavors will be overwhelming or cloying, but I think this is part of the point. And while you\'ll pay a pretty penny for everything here, you\'re getting items that are meticulously crafted and represent an inspired fusion of cultures and ingredients. Exactly what the Bay Area is all about.', ""A few things! location doesn't have the best parking, however. the atmosphere is very clean and neat. i ordered the sesame horchata which was on the sweeter side and thick. definitely had both flavors! i also got the kaya toast because everyone was raving about it. It was a thick soft toast with pandan cream over it. which was powerful in flavor, however was too sweet after a few bites. finally, i got the red bean anko sticky bun. i really didn't like this one. flavor was weird. overall, this place is okay. took a while to get my drink and toast, given there weren't any other customers at the time"", ""Everything about Breadbelly is delightful! The cafe's food is yummy and their ceramic cups/plates are beautiful. We came on a Saturday morning and fortunately there was parking and plenty of tables inside.We ordered their kaya toast, their roasted garlic toast, ube tart, and the black sesame horchata drink. Both of the toasts were delicious. The pandan flavor on the kaya jam was flavorful but in my opinion, there was a bit too much. Ube tart was very sweet. The tart part reminded me of the classic Chinese egg tart pastry- thought it was an interesting twist. Tasted like what you'd expect (wish marshmallow wasn't that sweet). The only downside is that it's kinda pricy. They also forgot one of our orders but they were very nice about it and refunded me."", 'After seeing so many pictures of the Kaya Toast from Breadbelly on Instagram, I was determined to go and persuaded my friend to go with me. We had a lovely time talking and catching up at the cute, cozy cafe, but the delicious treats soon were the only things that were on our minds when we took our first bite. Food:- Kaya Toast--$6My friend and I were absolutely blown away by this toast, and after one bite we were very tempted to buy one more. The toast used Breadbelly\'s milk bread, which was incredibly fluffy, soft, toasted to perfection, and buttery. The coconut-pandan jam on top was pleasantly sweet and creamy, and the flakes of sea salt sprinkled on top cut through the sweetness and brought all the flavors together. A new favorite toast that I will definitely be back for!- ""Not Ube!"" Tart--$7Another well-composed treat with sweet and salty elements, and a variety of textures. The torched meringue on top was incredibly creamy and airy and was the perfect complement to the chunky yet smooth purple sweet potato filling (hence ""not ube""). Shavings of salted egg yolk on top added a unique salty element to balance out the flavors. The tart crust was buttery and flaky too. Tips:- We arrived around 3 pm on a Friday and there was no line and spaces open at the tables. Highly suggest coming in during an off hour to enjoy the food in the store. The plates, interior decor, and brightly painted storefront must be enjoyed!', ""Finally got to try Breadbelly today, and it didn't disappoint. This Asian American bakery started by two Atelier Crenn alums first caught my attention from Instagram, where they were advertising pastry boxes before the actual store opened. Everything is instaworthy, but the Not Ube tart was the stand out item for me. Interior: small but crowded on a Sunday Food: I tried 3 pastries and 2 drinks for $27- Not Ube Tart: The most delicious thing I had here. It's flakey, made of potato, and topped with the perfect cloud of cream and sugar. -Brown Butter mochi: I wasn't a huge fan of this, especially after the tart, and it tasted okay- Sesame cookie: this was pretty and wrapped up real nicely, but it tasted okay too. The sesame flavor is strong. -Sesame horchata: thick and yummy, with full on sesame flavor, if that's your thing. I haven't had anything like it before. I want to come back for the Kaya Toast since everyone was ordering it, but my belly was too full of bread :p"", ""Super cute cafe with good food and completely worth a return visit! Actually left the place wishing I lived in the area, since I would love to make this a frequent neighborhood spot. It's kind of a hipster Asian American trendy cafe? That's the only way I can describe it but it's so so good - a lot of the food here reminds me of updated takes on food I would eat at friends' houses at home. Highly recommend the kaya toast (coconut pandan jam) - very sweet without being saccharine and the bread itself is also really good. Also recommend the char siu sandwich. The bread is really good and soft and the pork was fantastic. I also got the 50-50 (half tea half coffee sweetened with condensed milk) and the Anko sticky bun!"", 'Beautiful, adorable breakfast/brunch place with creamy bread and photogenic, quirky baked goods. My friend and I were craving savory food, so we ordered the breakfast sandwich and egg pocket. I also got a black sesame horchata out of curiosity and my love of anything black sesame. Overall, this cute place is definitely worth checking out and splurging on at least once.The breakfast sandwich was warm and toasted to perfection. The red pepper spread was too spicy for me (I\'m not a fan of spicy food), but my friend loved it. It\'s like a gourmet twist to a breakfast classic, a bit expensive though for the size (like $8).I was a little skeptical at first of the egg pocket being cold (I\'m not a fan of cold asparagus or cold bread) but the biting into the freshness of the bread combined with the creamy egg salad made me forget all of my initial doubts. I inhaled that delicious egg pocket.The black sesame horchata was the most delicious (then again, it\'s literally a hybrid of two of my favorite flavors, horchata and black sesame so I\'m biased). I\'m so glad that I wasn\'t ""cheated"" as usual and the tall glass had the perfect amount of ice in it rather than way too much. It was creamy, sweet but not too sweet, and tasted like rice-y black sesame. I was okay with not being able to taste the cinnamon, since I\'m pretty sure it would clash with the sesame.If I come back to treat myself one day, I will definitely try their famous pandan toast and yummy-looking cake.', 'It\'s been about 2 months since they\'ve opened their doors and things are looking great! \xa0Awesome weekend crowd and plenty of offerings still available on Sunday around noon. \xa0We came back to get a few of our favorites along with trying their ""not ube"" tart + the 50/50 drink, both were excellent as well. \xa0Loved the salted egg yolk shavings on the tart, it\'s very unique and a great mix of sweet + savory.Definitely a great addition to the neighborhood. \xa0If you haven\'t been by yet, go early in the day and give them a try!', 'Kaya toast - 5/5Cappuccino - 4/5Anko sticky bun -4.5/5Not ube tart - 3.5/5Service - 4/5', 'Perfect.Everything we ate was tasty and the service/vibe was warm and non-pretentious. It is still possible to have a nice bakery with a cool vibe without tipping into that uncomfortable gentrification vibe that some newer places have. Felt like a neighborhood spot and folks of all ages were there (family friendly). Great light and decor too! We had a sampling of things for two hungry gals: breakfast sandwich, kaya toast, almond cookies, not-Ube toast and a ham&cheese bread topped with cheese.Everything was delicious! Even the coffee was exceptional! Love the nod to Filipino flavors as well. Will be back!', ""It took me an hour to get here because I live on the other side of the city, but I'd go back for the Kaya toast alone. It's SO good. And I consider myself an expert given that I grew up in Singapore and most of my mornings started with Kaya toast. It would've been $1 instead of $6 in Singapore, but I'll take what I can get.I liked the char siu sandwich, but it was sooooo overpriced at $16, even for SF standards. I don't know if they bake their own bread for the sandwich- it tasted like any regular white bread from the grocery store. Not sure what warrants that high of a price tag. The brown butter mochi was quite good, but the anko sticky bun was a letdown. I love red bean and the moment I saw it I knew I had to have it. But the bun was very dry, and I wish it had a bit more red bean. Given how many SF bakeries make absolutely perfect sticky buns, I can't give them a pass for this. I should've ordered the not ube tart instead. The space is quaint but there's very limited seating. I did feel bad for occupying a table for 3+ hours but my friend and I had a lot to chat about. And the tables are close together so I'm pretty sure the woman next to us got the full scoop of every dating horror story we've experienced in the bay lol.Hopefully they'll read feedback on yelp and make improvements so I can bump them to 5 stars."", 'Debuted at 1408 Clement Street in the waning days of 2018, Breadbelly finally took the big step from pop-up to brick-and-mortar, a minimalist space in Richmond Districct bringing the team\'s collection of Asian-inspired baked goods to an area lacking for anything similar and already drawing a good following thanks to social media as well as word of mouth.The brainchild of James Wong, his wife Katherine Campecino-Wong and Clement Hsu, all three having met at Atelier Crenn and Chef Campecino-Wong previously honing her skills at Mourad, it is upon entry to the longer-than-wide space that guests will find a small seating area and well-culled collection, perhaps one dozen items in total plus Tea and Coffee though the lack of Creamer or sweeteners save for Stevia may limit the enjoyment of beverages for some. Priced similar to other Bay Area artisans such as Tartine and Neighbor, but more like The Bakery at Fat Rice in Chicago as relates to ideas, nearly every guest visiting Breadbelly will have likely at least seen photos of Kaya Toast that is made to order, the housemade Milk Bread springy like Brioche and carefully layered with bright green Jam tiptoeing between sweet and savory, a lack of Eggs or Soy straying from tradition but both texture and flavor justifying the hype.Hoping to win-over the diverse ethnicities of their neighborhood, but at the same time dubbing the ideas ""New American,"" it was in follow-up to warm Toast that five Pastries were tasted, the gelatinous mouthfeel of Mochi probably unfamiliar to many who\'ve not explored Hawaiian cuisine but here smartly balanced by crushed Peanuts while the ""Choco-Soba-Ko"" Cookie is more than a mouthful to say but easy to devour as crispy top and edges give way to a soft center studded by two types of Chocolate.Stumbling with Banana Bread, the $7 loaf assuredly sharable but entirely overwhelmed by tangy Marmalade, fans of Adzuki Bean should not miss the Sticky Bun topped with Caramel, comparisons to ""Boston Baked Beans"" Candy justified though the base itself attests to skilled bakers while Breadbelly\'s ""Not Ube!"" Tart a first tastes a lot like southern Sweet Potato Pie before developing a more nuanced and savory finish thanks to shavings of Egg Yolk.']"

First time trying it and now we are forever fans :)', 'Don\'t waste your time walking up the hill. Despite several positive reviews about vegan options at this place, we walked here and were met with a curt response of ""no."" And ""nothing"" when I asked if they could throw something vegan together. Maybe that\'s just the normal SF attitude but it was a complete turn off. I didn\'t even want to spend my money on coffee there. Almond and soy are their only upcharged dairy-free options. What a shame! Looked cute on the inside', 'A small cute cozy cafe located at a convenient location in Nob Hill. I was so excited to try their cragels but they were out of it! :( Some other time I guess!Ordered a Chai latte and egg salad sandwich to go. Both were pretty good. Crunchy and delicious bread. I ate the hot egg salad sandwich for first time and it was very interesting (Order yours cold if you want, staff is pretty friendly and accommodating). Only reason for taking off 2 stars: After reaching home, I realized that my sandwich was missing its accompaniments ie lettuce, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers :(', ""I looove Beanstalk! I've been here a few times now and am about to become a regular once I move to Nob Hill next week! Such a bright and sunny cafe with CRAGELS! I instantly become happier every time I walk into Beanstalk. I order the Cragel breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese, avocado, tomato, and pesto. oh my goodness, this is definitely one of the better breakfast sandwiches I've had. Add an iced latte to the mix and you've got yourself a scrumptious breakfast situation. Friendly staff, good vibes, and delicious food. Definitely on the pricey side. My sandwich + my drink = $17. But for sure worth every penny."", ""This cute cafe is conveniently located a few blocks of Union Square. I was staying nearby and there were only a few options available for a quick bite on an early Sunday morning. Beanstalk didn't disappoint. I ordered a simple cragel (croissant/bagel) with cream cheese. The cragel was toasted and the quality cream cheese melted nicely. Service was ok, interior was cute, I'm a fan. I saw other patrons with different items and all looked appetizing.#6/2019"", 'The sandwich is a bit dry, the taste is not mellow in every bite.

Customer service and friendliness - 0/5. I asked for room in my coffee, so the cashier left me a little space. There was only whole milk and half and half available to use, so I asked the barista if I could use the soy milk to top off my coffee. He said no, not if I didn't pay the 35 cents for soy. I showed him how little I would be using (less than an inch), and he said no, sorry. Are you kidding me? I understand charging extra for non-dairy milks - for lattes, aux laits, etc. You're getting 8-16 oz. of it. But to charge the same amount for a small splash makes no sense. And then to actually be a stickler about it is even more of a turn-off. I'm newly in the neighborhood often, and needless to say, this place will not be my go-to. I hope saving the 8 cents by withholding the soy milk was worth it!"", ""So now I am really confused. \xa0I was back in town for an annual conference and staying a block away. \xa0I don't mind the hike up the hill. \xa0I made a mistake though. \xa0From Yelp, it appeared the place didn't open until 8 but I think it really opened at 7 so I wish I had come earlier than I did. \xa0Second mistake, I think this business- well it has definitely expanded taking over a second shopfront when it used to be just half the size but I think perhaps the success of the business either led to it being sold or under different management. \xa0I did not see the Asian husband/wife team from before and instead of owners, it seemed to be employed staff. \xa0Nothing wrong with that, just a majorly different and unexpected vibe.So the reason I came back was that although I am a huge fan of the breakfast sando, I really wanted to try the toast cup which I never had before. \xa0I didn't even look for it on the menu or do a quick visual scan so it was quite a surprise when I returned to my room, and spilled my cappucino to find that it was tiny. \xa0The toast part of it was different as well. \xa0In past visits, I remember seeing them roll out a slice of actual sandwich bread for the toast and I'm not sure but thought it was two eggs with the bacon. \xa0This toast was still good but not the sandwich bread and it was only one egg. \xa0I finished it in two bites and was left wanting more. \xa0This whole visit was a bit of a bust. \xa0If you've never been before, I would still strongly recommend it to try but if you've been before, you too may be in for a surprise."", ""Cute little coffee / breakfast spot.

The perfectly toasted bagel and cheese was top with fresh egg omelet so fluffy and light it was a pleasure to eat. Warm and satisfying for a couple of out of towners', ""Cragel is a must-try, but I would get it straight up as a carb instead of a sandwich next time. Bacon was very fatty and the cragel seemingly fell apart after being cut. Being from the NY area, I have a high standard for bagels, and this flaky crunchy croissant combo was awesome. Great mocha, too. Note: if you're getting takeout for a few people, BYO bag. I was not given one for my two sandwiches and coffee and made for a funny walk home."", 'Cute spot a few mins away from the intercontinental and Fairmont!

The pre-baked egg cups (pictured) looked great on Yelp but it took waay to long for them to reheat and by the time I walked 3 blocks they were not warm anymore. Plus the egg was solid and the bread was like a crouton... Not what I was expecting.The next day we gave them a second try and it was equally underwhelming. The service was epically slow and they left the bacon off of my Cragel. I asked for it on the side but finished my Cragel before they even gave me an update, so we left.', ""I was so excited to try the cragel since croissant everything is the new craze (thank you Dominque Amsel w the cronut).

Jane The Bakery,"[""My favorite bakery in SF!I'm here 3 times a week for fresh bread. The polenta/olive loaf, fig walnut and sourdough are all perfect.The best kept secret \xa0at Jane's is the Roasted Cauliflower Sandwich."", ""The first time I stopped at their bakery location, when it first opened, it must have been an off day because I couldn't find any vegan options. This was surprising because their regular locations always had muffins, cookies, etc.However, having gone more recently, I was delighted to find a few different cookie options and muffin. My partner got the chocolate chip cookie and I got the blueberry banana muffin. And that muffin was seriously one of the best vegan ones I've had in a while. All too often vegan muffins can be on the dry side. But the fruit in this muffin was plentiful and gave it the perfect consistency.Now that I know to look here for vegan pastries, I'll also need to try some of their breads. The loaves, etc. behind the counter look excellent!"", ""Jane... I'm onto you. You don't post your prices. You ask for 20% tip when you pay... so you're hoping people order a ton of food not knowing the prices because really, who is going to sit there asking the price of each and every item... and then you hope we are fooled into tipping like it's a restaurant... hmm. ok. A bit sneaky are you, Jane? But your taste is good and the service is good, so.... Ugh, Fine. I like you enough. I'll be back."", ""Who knew you were here?! \xa0Stumbled out of the Imperial Day Spa after a relaxing acupressure session to this amazing smell of fresh baked goods and lines of eager customers. Who has an appetite after being walked on - yet onward I went. Walk inside and you are greeted by stacks of fresh baked breads and cases of treats from cookies to muffins to Nutella brioche to vegan veggie sandwiches. In Janes it's not about where you start just be sure to keep going down to the coffee bar. Be kind to your servers and leave a tip too. Enjoy!!"", ""One of my favorite bakeries in SF. If you don't come early enough they run out of everything and by early it's slim pickings at 11am.I got the black sesame kiwi coffee cake and it was so heavenly. It had the perfect amount of light sweetness and moisture lasting until the following day. \xa0I hate when coffee cakes are dry and you really need to pair it with coffee. The coffee cakes here seem to change with the season but they were both good both times I had it. The Vietnamese coffee twist bun was sweet and really tasted like a vietnamese coffee. The only issue I had with this was there were pieces of coffee beans in this pastry and I wasn't expecting it so it really caught me off guard. I could really do without that because you have soft delicious bread with beans inside of it. It's like having seeds in an orange. I can't seem to get that lattice cardamom lattice bun so don't hit the snooze button on that alarm. They have a parking lot but it's always full and even parking in the surrounding area is a little difficult. Totally worth the trek though. In case some of you were wondering Jane the bakery is different from Jane on Fillmore. Jane on Fillmore serves more food and is more of a sit down spot. The bakery has some seating but more of a grab and go type of spot."", ""There are about 3-4 Jane The Bakery locations in SF. It's an interesting bakery business and I think it's worth it. I was going to spend some time on this Saturday at Bob Mizer, but that was canceled. So I decided to have a lunchtime adventure at Jane The Bakery on Geary Blvd. I drove a car because they have a small parking lot, but I got lost finding this on Geary. Anyhow, when I arrived, I noticed a long, unbearable line, but I decided to stick with the line. I didn't know what I wanted and it was hard to decide. I decided on a cheesy flatbread and a fresh baguette($4). I decided on an espresso shot($3). I had the flatbread at the shop and also drank my espresso, which was a bit sour to taste. It was served in a nice black ceramic espresso shot cup. I really don't like when they serve espresso in cardboard cups. Espresso should always be served in a ceramic shot cup, and maybe with a saucer. PERFECTO! I have the baguette at home and offered it to my father. Then I drove home."", ""Meh, was not impressed so probably wouldn't return since there are so many other bakeries in the area. We ordered an avocado mash toast & mushroom toast. Neither really stood out to me. The avocado toast seemed like something you can make at home yourself and I wasn't a fan of the pickled jalapenos - made it kinda cheap like hotdog condiments. The mushroom toast wasn't bad, but it was soooo tiny. I was still starving afterwards. Total was $17. I also ordered a matcha latte, which they completely forgot about. When I checked up on it, they apologized and asked for my card again because they forgot to charge me for it and forgot to make it. It tasted very grainy and powdery! Maybe they were rushing when they made it for me? Another $5. After $21 spent here, we were still hungry & dissatisfied so we went to B Patisserie afterwards :)."", ""Delightful! I really love this place. The cheddar chive biscuit is delicious. Crusty exterior and light and fluffy center. The chocolate croissant is very good as well.

I also tried a mocha super tasty but it definitely woke me up (I am not a big coffee drinker)."", ""Huge bread lover here, with an extra love for croissants. And wow the pastries were very impressive. They nailed the classic croissant very well and had a lot of original interesting creations. Chocolate croissant --was our favorite! Chewy, flaky, with a fragile crust. The chocolate was good quality too. It was also huge but we engulfed it. Lattice bun --This was quite new and interesting! It's like a croissant brioche bun-- crioche bun? Yeah not as catchy as a cruffin but love the novelty of it. It was really puffed up and inflated, I mean the cross-section was quite impressive. The cardamom custard cream was bomb. It's like a vanilla custard with a mild cinnamon-y spice. Latte with oat milk was delicious too. Cute cup! :) The con was that-- there's barely seating and there's that one long tiny table facing the window, \xa0but your back will be very close to the line of people.

Built on ideas of hospitality, quality and balance, the menu slowly evolving to now include Pastries, Breakfast and Lunch served from 7:00am daily, it is immediately on entry that guests will notice an array of items unmatched by any other artisan bakeshop in The Bay Area, overhead menus adding to what can be found on racks or in cases with fresh items continuously being baked in back. Mostly locally-sourced and organic when possible, head baker Jorgen Carlsen and Pastry Chef Alexander Terrazas assisting Chef Michael at ""The Bakery"" while other locations each have their own team in place to cut down on transfers, it is well-advised that first-time visitors take time to peruse before placing an order, though a well-trained staff is happy to make recommendations for the indecisive. Truly a scratch kitchen, Chef Carlen\'s collection of Breads built from old starters and house-blended Flour forming the base for Toast and Sandwiches, it was while awaiting the former slathered in ground Almonds and Raspberry Puree that eight additional items were requested, a total just over $40 including Milk and Coffee not bad considering both the area and quality.Targeting both favorites and variety, the Gluten-free Toast noteworthy for a dense crumb created by no-less than nine Nuts and Grains, it was moving next to four Cookies that a range of textures and flavors were discovered, the ""Cookie For Breakfast"" unfortunately very dry save for bits of Fruit while Cap \'n Crunch, Chocolate Chip Toffee and one dubbed ""Crazy"" all sported crispy rims and soft centers plus the amount of sweetness expected from their ingredients.Onward to Viennoiserie, the Almond Croissant caked with Frangipane thankfully not compromised by too much of the cloying Paste inside, those seeking something laminated would be better off targeting Jane\'s Kouign Amann that ranks middle of the pack for Northern California, but for those seeking something truly memorable the decision comes down to a buttery Scone made with roasted Chestnuts versus Jane\'s ""Lattice Bun"" that eats like Yorkshire Pudding filled with Custard heavily perfumed by Cardamom.', ""Their pastries are above average and for that I give them 4 stars.

Not cool."", ""Apart from Peet's this is my go-to spot for coffee on Chestnut Street. Reasonably priced espresso drinks and consistently good taste and quality. Can get crowded during peak times...I wish there was more outdoor seating or even a back patio, but the interior is still charming and has enough space and outlets if you bring your work with you."", 'Very strong coffee, good prices.

The almond milk was so watery bland. My husband rarely puts sugar in his latte that he had to add some for flavor. I don't add any sugar or sweeteners to mine. I am not one to throw a coffee away but I through away my $5 coffee."", ""Cute, no-frills coffee shop that's definitely a neighborhood favorite.

Every time I come Renaissance music or classical instamental is playing; fyi, this isn't the right place for loud get-togethers as some customers just come sit to enjoy the music.Good floor space, friendly baristas, and interesting treats (loved their 7 layer bar!) sold up front. Will definitely come back to try the traditional crumble cake - all that powdered sugar!"", 'Chestnut Street Coffee Roastery has been in business and operated by the same owner for I believe 25 years.

The roasted coffees here are top shelf as well. And the prices here remain reasonable. This cafe is a true gem in the Marina and a great independently owned cafe is getting harder and harder to find in SF these days. Chestnut Street Coffee Roastery 5 stars for everything you do!', 'Came here for a cold brew and it was fantastic! They roast their own beans with a variety of single origin coffees. Would definitely return!', 'Great coffee / espresso drinks and treats from an independent business owner. Lots of seating indoors and they even have a couple of tables out front.', 'Great local cafe in the Marina! I especially loved the decor (coffee beans and accessories) lining the walls. I brought my parents here during our walk and they were also feeling the vibes. My mom ordered their house drip and was very very pleased with its profile, and the addition of one of their little pastry treats along with our warm drink on a gusty SF afternoon was a perfect way to relax.']"
Klatch Coffee,"[""One of the few spots that pulls a great espresso. Speak with the baristas to understand what type of flavors they're pulling today. It often differs from whats on the bag, and is surprising when someone gets it right.Thrilled that there's finally a good coffee shop in the neighborhood. Space is clean, staff is friendly, and the team is receptive to feedback (they lowered the music volume and are bringing a sound team to make it a more pleasant experience). Also get that cookie with an espresso from Craftsman and Wolves. It's dope."", ""Legit Nitro cold brew.

We stopped by this place since our friend lives nearby and we were going to her place later in the evening. The ambiance is quite nice, with long wooden tables and chairs, and wide windows that allow you to get plenty of sunlight and to see out into the streets. They have a selection of pastries that look quite nice including kouign amanns, and a variety of coffees. Unfortunately there weren't too many options for non-coffee drinkers like myself, and the prices were a bit on the expensive side (most coffees were around $4, shakes were $7-8, and pastries were $4-5). Still, they have fast free wifi and a nice space to work!"", ""One of our favorite coffee places!! They originally started in SoCal. LA to be exact! Everytime we were in LA, we would make it a point to stop in. They've recently opened here in SF (Franklin St). Soon to have another location in the Mission. This is going to sound funny (and I happen to be severely lactose intolerant). My very first time at Klatch, I ordered a mocha shake. Back then, pat milk was just starting to hype up, and I saw they had oat milk on their choices of milk. Me getting too excited, I told the lady I wanted a mocha shake with Oat Milk. She looked at me kinda funny and started to explain that their shakes are made with ice cream that contains dairy....I thought for a second, and said, what the heck! Let's make it anyway! She smiled and said ok!! That was the start of the love life between oat milk and mocha shake at Klatch!!! Lactose intolerant or not, best mocha shake ever!!! At this location, they serve pastries from Craftsman and Wolves, another one of my favorite places!! Come to Klatch Coffee for some really good coffee. Oh hubby loves their cold brew as well! We also ordered pastries: smoked ham, swiss cheese & mustard croissant and the hidden star apple cider cake Donut w/ cinnamon sugar!!

The coffee is very expensive ($6.50 for an iced coffee with milk) and I went back wanting a plain iced coffee and they were out of cold brew (coffee shop doesn't have coffee?) so they offered me an alternative, nitro brew, for a dollar extra ($5). The first thing I noticed was it was sour. Upon notifying the barista, she assured me this was the intended flavor of the coffee (I trust her if she said it was, but I personally don't enjoy sour coffee, maybe that's just me). If I am going to get a simple coffee order such as an iced coffee, I plan to go elsewhere to get it simpler and cheaper.""]"

It has a lot of the ordinary staples of coffee shops such as your Chai lattes and mochas and what not. They have bagels and sandwiches and oatmeal for breakfast and a lot of pastries.

I highly recommend it.', 'This was a short coffee stop while waiting to be seated for breakfast at a place nearby. We walked into this small coffee shop, and ordered some cappuccinos. Our cappuccinos were served on to-go cups, but that was not an issue.The place was ok, although it could use better decor. The coffee came out just fine, and gave me the jolt of caffeine I was looking for. They have outside seating as well, so we sat outside to take in some air. This coffee shop sits in an alright neighborhood, with plenty of food options around. Parking can be a pain around here, so keep a good eye out for a spot.', ""What I like about this place? It's chill! On a Sunday afternoon every other place is packed, so I came here to get some work done and have a reason to get out of the house. This place is perfect for that. Definitely less hip and trendy than some of the cafes around, but cozy nonetheless. And affordable. I easily found seating and ordered an Almond Milk Latte at the counter. Wow, that one really blew my mind. Loved every sip of it and would come back just for that. I'm not sure what almond milk they used, but it was a game changer. You know, some almond milk tastes like you have just swallowed a piece of sand paper. Not super sweet, nor too dry. Will definitely be back to check out the rest of their menu. Thanks Cafe Murano for giving me a break from the lines around Pac Heights!"", ""#111/2016The coffee was just right, strong but not too strong.

Coffee and tea options are not too special. Their chai is housemade, but very sweet. I frequent this place!', ""Quaint little coffee shop themed out with French posters. Free Wi-Fi so it's a great place to sit and chill or study. Outlets are also available. Parking is a hassle though. Coffee quality is actually not bad, but more on the sweeter side so I always ask to lessen the sugar content. They close early at 5! But other than that it's one of my favorite grab and go coffee stops when I'm in the area."", ""A cozy cafe with attentive owners. In the morning, it may feel like a busy grab-and-go place with espresso drinks and a range of breakfast options (my favorites: lox bagel and oatmeal - both come with fresh fruit). Later in the day, it may feel like a chill living room where freelancers are welcomed to hang around (there is wifi, plenty of outlets, and good tables). The vibe is low key and pleasant - there is usually nice music inside, and there are a couple of tables surrounded by flower pots outside. I see only 3 drawbacks:1) They close at 5pm. That's too early. Maybe bring back the beer/wine and keep open until 8?2) The juicer is super noisy. While I love the fresh OJ, maybe the juicer can be used somewhere in a back room.3) The tables get very messy during the day - the staff should wipe them regularly as they are picking up empty cups and plates.Still, a great place!"", ""Charming little cafe with a WONDERFUL staff and great, affordable food. I come here almost every weekend to get coffee and occasionally breakfast if I'm wanting something quick.Highly recommend their breakfast bagels, the oatmeal, and their veggie panini!"", ""Great local spot in Japantown to grab some coffee and crank out some work. They've got a pretty good selection of coffee, teas and snacks. I went for the breakfast bagel which included a colorful and tasty cup of fresh fruit. While it stayed busy, it was never overwhelming.

I love ditch crunch but theirs was more like a dinner roll texture. Overall though the sand which was very good.Now I really liked the coffee.

It is Delicious. So much hearty flavor packed into a healthy possibly vegan meal. I'm so happy I found this place, albeit moving forward, I'll have to choose either a meal or a matcha. Being that everything is made in house, the matcha is a bit pricey. But I'm sure totally worth it. I tried the walnut milk in mine, first time trying walnut milk, not sure its my fav. but they have many other options, and I'm not afraid to keep trying. I'd recommend this place. Didn't take long, although they were packed when I arrived. It's a cozy place, with an otherworldly feel, sort of like if an apothecary housed a cafe. But isn't that what food is? Medicine. Food is medicine. So, I'm leaving you to finish up my meal. Five stars!!!"", '***3.5 Stars*** Dearly ""Beloved"", We are gathered here today to celebrate my *newest* discovery of the Beloved Café! Yep! This place is FIYAH! It\'s so fiyah that I still had to rate them 4 stars even though I didn\'t particularly love my drink. BUT... the atmosphere here alone is enough to make me come back. Seriously! What a relaxing and totally unpretentious café! The Mission sure has some amazing little gems, I tell ya! And, the Beloved is definitely one of them. Usually when I\'m on 24th and Mission, it\'s because I\'m craving Mexican food. But on this very day, I had a craving for a hot drink. A hot drink? Yaaas Boo! I was cold and needed something to warm me up. I Yelped up a few cafes and many of them were already closed (it was around 8pm). Beloved popped up and it looked pretty solid. So, off I went to explore. Got there and my little heart kinda melted. It\'s just.... sooo stinkin\' CUTE! The vibes in that place were unreal. The baristas were madd chill. It\'s small but extremely cozy! There are a few couches to lounge on and a bar top where you can watch the baristas work their magic. I was intrigued! I sat at the bar and Damian gave me a menu to look at. But um... I kind of couldn\'t stop looking at him. Damian is eye candy, y\'all! They\'ve got some good looking baristas up in that joint! All the more reason to come back, right? But, I digress... So when I finally did look at the menu, the first thing that I noticed was that they use organic plant-based ingredients in all of their products (aka they\'re vegan friendly). I\'m a tea lover and they have a whole host of different teas on their menu! Score! They also make fresh juices, smoothies, salads and bowls. After reading the description of their golden milk, I decided to give it a try. It was fun to watch it being prepared. But after drinking it, I quickly came to the conclusion that it was just... okay. I did taste some of the spices but the drink as a whole was a little flat. Maybe it was because it was made with almond milk? To be honest, I\'m not the biggest fan of almond milk. However, the wonderful ambiance and great service is enough to make me come back. Their golden milk wasn\'t exactly my cup of tea (you see what I did there?), but that doesn\'t mean that it can\'t be somebody else\'s. I\'m planning on coming back to try their smoothies and fruit bowls the next time that I\'m in the area. Hopefully, I\'ll find something that I really like next time around.', ""Here I am, sitting at the communal table on a sunny afternoon, admiring the beautiful light reclaimed wood counter and thinking about what I want to order. This tiny space is like a portal to a fairy's kitchen in the woods. It's across the street from the 24th BART station and you could easily mistake it for being just like another cafe in the grungy Mission until you walk in. There are tall ivy plants dripping from the ceilings and a cute little gong, yes, a gong, that welcomes you. I've never rang it but maybe next time I will. This was a weekday and I came here by myself and a book because I wanted to look cool while eating solo. Who am I kidding, I need more than a book to look cool. I'm on a 10 days cleanse and this is one of the few places that can accommodate my rather wholesome albeit restricting diet. So I figure body detox + digital detox, makes it acceptable to show up for food in sweatpants, no makeup on, and my hair up in a lazy bun. Yay! Beloved Cafe is known for their wholesome raw vegan nourishments. I feel like this is the tiny version of Cafe Gratitude without the adorable food item names... I wonder if they are connected somehow... Anyway, I made up my mind and ordered the Green Detox juice (notice a trend here?) and the Quinoa bowl with roasted veggies with added avocados because I'm usually the person that ask for extra avocados anyway. You can tell a lot about a restaurant by the quality of their avocados. Here at Beloved Cafe, theirs was hella sexy, I gotta say. It was muscular, ripe, and smooches easily with the fork. I appreciate the freshness of their offerings and it is most evident in their juice. Everything seems made to order, sans desserts, so things take a little longer to arrive, but hey, it's the antithesis of fast foods.So as I'm spooning my quinoa bowl, savoring the medley flavors of roasted sweet potatoes, kale, sprouts, avocado, and grains, and simultaneously reading a chapter, I feel a tapping on my left shoulder from the person sitting next to me. Well, what a pleasant surprise, I ended up making a new friend that day, someone who had an insight about what I was reading about. My new friend and I decided to order a dessert to share, it was something new that I haven't tried before. The raw vegan cheesecake arrived to our communal table pretty in pink and playfully adorned with berries, it was a sweet ending to a naturally authentic experience. I love Beloved Cafe and I highly recommend you coming here with a friend or by yourself like I did, stay off your phone, and say hello to the person sitting next to you. You might end up sharing a dessert with them ;-)"", ""When my friends and I were planning on attending a performance at The Dance Brigade's Dance Mission Theater, we looked for the best reviewed restaurant within close proximity of the Theater and found that Beloved Cafe met both criteria perfectly.It was a slight bit hidden in the sea of buildings on 24th Street, however, once we walked in, I had a good feeling that this was going to be a positive experience.Beloved isn't very big as while there is bar-style seating, it was mostly taken which led us to have to sit in a slightly cramped couch corner area. However, it was very comfortable so I have no complaints about it. The staff there were extremely attentive, and my friends ordered a juice and a couple of salads, while I personally got the Buddha Berry Smoothie Bowl and the Raw Vegan Cheesecake which had a coffee-style flavor that day.My friends got their food and drinks within 15-20 minutes while unfortunately mine took about 45 minutes. However, was the wait worth it? Let me put it this way. I'm not a vegan whatsoever and this isn't my typical scene as I'm very happy with various ethnic meaty foods, burgers, sushi, etc. The Buddha Berry smoothie bowl was hearty and flavorful beyond belief - not to mention the size of the bowl I thought was more than fair at the price point. I usually inhale food and it took me a while to finish, so needless to say, I'd have this again in a heartbeat. The real star of the show? The Raw Vegan Cheesecake. I usually don't eat cheesecake because while I enjoyed it as a kid, it just wore down on me over the years. This one on the other hand - HOLY COW! The mouse-like consistency with the coffee flavor set it over the top and made it the best cheesecake I'd ever had in my life. Everyone was happy with what they had gotten and virtually finished their plates, and the staff even surprised us with a sample of a shortbread brownie-style pastry that was again unbelievable. I don't know how Beloved does it, but if this is what they call health food, I'm totally in! Thank you so much Beloved for the incredible experience and showing me just how delicious healthy vegan/vegetarian food can be. I can't say enough about this place and will definitely be back."", ""This place has it all. A lovely warm and comforting atmosphere, paired with delicious food and drinks. I've been here twice now. Most recently, I had their Red Velvet Smoothie Bowl and a homemade Chai. The bowl is packed with nutritious deliciousness and makes a decent sized breakfast (or snack!). The chocolate flavors in it are rich but the beet gives it a bit of earthy flavor that's unusual but absolutely delicious. The chai was perfectly spicy. Previously, I had their golden milk which did not disappoint! The people who work here are also great. They get busy since it's a small place, but they make all customers feel welcomed and valued."", ""I'm really surprised I haven't reviewed this place since I've been so many times and absolutely love it. This cafe has such a different vibe to any other. It's limited seating creates a really intimate atmosphere. The staff are super chill and give great recommendations on the menu. I'm obsessed with the lentil soup, hot chocolate, and cheesecakes. Oh, and the kale salad. I'm literally craving all of them now just thinking of them. I took my father in law here, someone that, by every measure, would not like a place like this (clean ingredients, super small, no meat or wine, etc.) and he actually loved it. He's a chatty guy and was super impressed with the staff's friendliness. I recommend this cafe to anyone--even those who think it might be a little too different for them. The food and drinks are reasons to visit, the staff and vibe are reasons to stay."", 'Love this place! Small hole in the wall, very welcoming, hippie vegan vibes. There is a bookshelve by the window alcove with very interesting reads. One book was about the Principles of Tao. We ordered the quinoa bowl, which can be made without onion and garlic!

She was so welcoming and caring and attentive and knowledgeable, it was incredible. She knew so much about so many of the amazing tea options, and shared so many \xa0smart and fun facts and stories about the different kinds they have and cool properties and benefits. She was so sweet and offered samples along with it to me and the other guests, and just made the day of everyone in the cafe for the 3 hours I ended up staying. I ended up with a Quinoa Bowl and a pot of Long Jin which was perfectly brewed every time she filled up the pot with hot water, which was often. She also recommended the carrot cake muffin which capped off my day perfectly. I'm visiting the area and she recommended some other spots and events to check out which is so much appreciated.

I've tried the quinoa bowl which is my fav bc of the chipotle sauce, kale salad, lemon ginger quinoa cheese cake and blueberry cheesecake, mushroom latte(so good!!!), matcha latte, adaptogen ball, morning ritual tea(you can taste all these amazing earthy flavors that work so well that this just might be my favorite tea ever), plus they give alkaline water too!

You can get a nice pot of tea to share for under $10. I've heard the lentil soup (dal) is delicious with avocado and sprouts-- will need to try this. The reishi/mushroom latte is complex and taste; it kind of reminds me of a wholesome Chinese herbal soup that my mom concocts every now and then. The space is rather small but intimate, and anyone who comes here will appreciate the intricate furnishings and details. I'd suggest for groups of 3 or smaller.

The interior is beautiful with reclaimed wood and cups on the walls. Thee lights are really pretty in there. There's limited seating inside, but the smoothies are so delicious. I got an order of the island tropics smoothie to go and a 6 oz cup of chai. Total ran out be around $17 with tax, and I thought it was a lot when I was paying, but IT IS WORTH. EVERY. PENNY. The reason I say this is the following. 1) the service and the staff are great. They are super kind and knowledgeable, offering free samples of golden milk and tea to my and my 4 friends who came. I ordered a smoothie and they made extra so they let me keep the extra, which I drank on the spot with enough to share. The staff are just thoughtful in preparing your drinks. 2) the drinks were damn delicious. The green smoothie was just so flavorful and fresh and it just gave me some joy!

Neighbor Bakehouse,"[""Easily the best sourdough load in the city is their olive loaf. But with exceptional pastries, such a nice staff - there's even more to love even if they do run out of bread. Pro tip: bread often runs out early (before noon) and lines can be 15+ mins. Plan accordingly"", ""This bakery is part of our Saturday morning routine. It's delicious, rain or shine they always have a line, honestly it's worth the wait. Everything is freshly baked, most of the time it's still warm when we get it. The staff is so friendly, and efficient.It's a very small place, limited out outdoor siting."", ""Good but not as outstanding as I expected. The very hyped pistachio blackberry twice-baked croissant is good but not worth a special trip, and I would only come back if in the area.There's no seating inside the bakery but there are many tables outside. However, in the morning (which is the best time for visiting bakeries) the seating area is covered in shade, so it might not be the most pleasant environment for enjoying pastries.From most to least liked, I tried:Recommended:-Pistachio blackberry twice-baked ($4.85)- tastes good because the filling is good - it's moist, sweet, and slightly tart, and the flavors of the pistachio and blackberry go well together. I did think it was a little too sweet, especially with the powdered sugar on top, The croissant itself is slightly dry by itself but is good together with the filling. It is a bit overhyped though - I've had better twice-baked croissants elsewhere (e.g. Baker Doe's).Better than OK:-Butter croissant ($3.50) - very crispy and light. While it does taste of butter, the flavor isn't /super/ buttery and it's a bit on the sweet side. It's good but not as good as I expected, and I think Arsicault Bakery and some bakeries in New York make better versions.-Ginger pull-apart ($4.25) - reminds me of a denser, slightly bread-like kouign amann. The base is coated in sugar, and the bottom half is more syrupy, sticky, and gingery. The ginger flavor overall was not strong.Not recommended:-Mushroom tart ($4.50) - flavorful filling, very cheesy and with a decent amount of mushrooms and onions. The pastry portion was crunchy and kind of flaky. But it was served completely cold (on a warm plate), so the cream-based filling was completely hard and not at all pleasant to eat."", ""I guess this month is all about James Beard noms. Nominated for outstanding baker, Greg Mindel of NB goes above and beyond the standard fare of morning pastries. Cannot believe it's been around since 2015 and I just discovered it now. Where have I bean?!On a misty Wednesday afternoon, my cousin and I walked into a 2-person line. So grateful to have weekdays off because I'm sure this place gets packed on weekends. The rain may have also kept people from making the trek, but that worked out for us. A 1.5h journey from East Bay, the trip was WELL. WORTH. IT. *Cue Fifth Harmony song* My mouth just salivates thinking of the *doughp* (pronounced dope). This makes me sound like a druggie, but they're really that amazing and for me, addictive. $34 and ~5min later, lunch was served.The spread: + Passionfruit doughp bun- *fav* despite being a die-hard chocolate lover+ Chocolate pudding doughp bun + Mushroom tart- maybe the least impressive of the 5, but still good+ Croque madam- be warned that egg is runny+ Hot chai lattes The service was quick and neighborly. The ladies behind the counter had great recommendations even though pretty much everything we ordered was excellent. I need to come back for the ham and cheese morning bun & everything croissant. Only open outdoor seating was available, which half-worked out until it rained. It was fun sitting in the rain though as I bit into my cream-filled doughp.

They're my favorite and I schedule my day around eating them. And there's such a large selection here! The winner in my book? Their smoked ham and cheese morning bun -- nice healthy serving of ham accompanied by a flakey croissant exterior. Yes, a wonderful morning was had indeed. A close runner-up is the savory everything croissant, which is their play on the everything bagel, with the cream cheese inside and everything.For those with a sweet tooth, there are of course all the usual suspects. And if you're looking for something beyond the run-of-the-mill pastry, I'd recommend trying the ginger pull-apart. The ginger and cinnamon are perfectly complementary, neither flavor overpowering the other.Neighbor Bakehouse has this hipster vibe that even I, a self-proclaimed basic, am undoubtedly a fan of. Maybe its the brick wall aesthetic, maybe its the open kitchen where you can see the pastry chefs working their magic. Regardless, park your butt at the outdoor picnic tables after purchasing a box and experience nirvana.--FYI Neighbor Bakehouse nabbed the #3 ranked spot on my bakery blog post (Inhale Carbs, Exhale Satisfaction ft. San Francisco, CA). To read my other pastry recommendations in SF, follow: link.medium.com/QwNg4YQK…"", 'Owned by Greg and Christine Mindel since 2012 there is a good chance anyone enjoying a Pastry inside one of San Francisco\'s top Coffee Shops over the last decade has tasted something from Neighbor Bakehouse, prior wholesale to the likes of Four Barrel and Sightglass eventually yielding a brick-and-mortar storefront early 2015 in the Dogpatch.Formally trained prior to years as a baking instructor, gigs at places such as Tartine benefitting both Mindel and the goods themselves, it is from a distance that Neighbor Bakehouse can be identified from Wednesday through Sunday, a line snaking out the door even with rain and guests almost universally emerging from the standing-room-only space with sizable boxes in their hands and smiles on their faces.Occupying 2343 Third Street, the surrounding buildings largely residential but short-term parking plentiful, it is after queuing that guests will be tempted by nearly three-dozen options ranging from Pizette to Viennesoire, prices competitive with other artisan bakeshops like Mr. Holmes while service is expedient yet pleasant.Known for several signatures, and utilizing most of Neigbor Bakehouse\'s space for production rather than seating, it was targeting diversity that seven items in total were requested, inclement weather necessitating a twenty minute drive across town before clouds would clear so that items beginning with a Muffin-sized Financier with good density and restrained sweetness could be tasted.Open at 6:30am but continuing to bake past 8:00am, the possibility of finding something still-warm a welcome surprise, it was taking advantage of good fortune that two additional Fruit and Nut combinations followed, the Pistachio Blackberry Twice-baked Croissant marvelously constructed with shattering Shell overlying buttery layers thinly spread with Jam while a Raspberry Hazelnut version performed even more admirably thanks to whole Nuts on top plus toasty notes inside that play well off seeded Preserves.Sticking to no script but their own, ""Pumpkin Spice"" season long gone but a slice of Brioche slathered in Puree mixed with Frangipane stunning in its subtlety, those seeking Mindel\'s best use of technique should not pass on a Ginger Pull-apart which eats like laminated Monkey Bread with lots of spice, and although the cleverly named \'Doughp\' (pronounced dope) Bun gets a lot of press it is actually Neighbor\'s Oat Coconut Pecan Chocolate Cookie that showed better as a result of being well balanced despite so much going on and still managing to be crisp around the edges but soft in the center despite so many moist ingredients.', 'It\'s rare that I give five stars for somewhere, but this place really, hands down, has some of the best pastries. \xa0It could be because they have savory pastries which cater more to my palate as I don\'t indulge in sweets too often. \xa0But truth be told, their pastry selection is solid. \xa0 The things we tried included the following:Cheddar, Chorizo, Black pepper pastryPROS:- flakiest dough I\'ve ever had but yet wasn\'t dry- good amount of filling, not too much cheese, and not too much chorizo- nice amount of black pepper: not overwhelmingCONS:- barely shareable: Maybe between two people, this can be ripped in half, but if you like savory pastries, you can probably easily kill 2 of these on your own.Savory Morning BunPROS:- good amount of seeds: I like seeds, they\'re good for you but they are also a con (see below)- not dry, good flakiness to the dough as wellCONS:- slightly drier than the cheddar chorizo pastry: could be because that was more of a croissant dough and may have had more butter. \xa0On that note, this is probably healthier.- seeds (too much for me): I personally do not like too many seeds because they get stuck all over. \xa0The coffee did help to wash it down, but for someone who has tight cheeks like me, my tongue ends up doing extra work to try and get it out.The selection of pastries is amazing. \xa0They literally had a rack right behind the counter of fresh pastries coming right out of the oven. \xa0It\'s definitely worth going. \xa0They also open early so get there early because reputation usually lends itself to selling out of the good stuff. \xa0Parking wasn\'t too bad when we went but then again, the early bird gets the worm. \xa0Service is relatively quick - most things are served immediately if they are behind the counter. \xa0Beverages that take some time to custom order get called out or sometimes served. \xa0There is outdoor seating which can kind of get a little chilly, but it\'s spacious still. \xa0The area is cute and clean, given that it\'s Dogpatch it may be ""out of the way"" for some people, but definitely worth the drive.', ""Highly recommended! Just about everything here is extremely well done. I've always loved their everything croissants that four barrel has, and have been meaning to come here for months. Had the triple onion pastry, it had a nice cheese and caramelized onions inside, and crispy/baked inions on the outside, and sesame seeds on top. Holy shito, it was good. The coffee cake pastry with raspberry jam inside was so delicious. \xa0The coffee crumb flavor was better than most coffee cakes I've had. Plus it was on this pastry with a moist, buttery flavor. And she's jam inside was cherry on top."", ""I stopped here to pick up some pastries for a company social event. The guy behind the counter was very helpful in giving recommendations and assisting with choosing a variety to hit the budget I was working with.Since these pastries were for the office, I had to show some restraint and not be 100% my usual gluttonous self (sigh) by eating everything, but everything that I did get to try was excellent:The chocolate chip cookie had a nice saltiness to it and the chocolate croissant was one of the better ones I've had in the city. Not quite as good as Arsicault (my favorite), but roughly on par with Tartine and better than Mr. Holmes.Great place to stop by if you're in this part of town!"", ""One of the only bakeries in the area that's opened early, so I stopped by before work one morning (I mean, it was highly suggested that you come early because all the good stuff sells out early). And I mean, what's better than freshly baked bread in the crisp morning area filling your lungs? Money in your wallet, that's what. But it's worth every penny. First, always support your local businesses and Neighbor Bakehouse is the epitome of that. I'm honestly not that into bread or baked goods for breakfast, but something told me the string of 4-5 star consistent reviews, there has to be something worth my hard earned money. Once you see the bricks, you know you're there! There most likely will be a ling since the interior is tiny! You walk right in and you stare at trays of baked goods (with labels) of course and somebody barks at you to order. You get worried and panic a little and all the things you wanted to order, you forget and then end up over ordering and end up with one of everything! That's basically what happens to me each time, but it's worth the calories. My favorite is the everything croissant- I don't know how they do it, but it's simply amazing. So buttery and flaky with cream cheese on the inside. It's like biting into heaven. I'm a savory type of person and I love morning buns, but theirs with ham & cheese just wasn't for me. Not enough filling and just too doughy. I'll stick with a sweet morning bun please. Their twice-baked is absolutely delicious and great over coffee and for sharing (but it's kind of hard, so more for dipping and those who enough a little extra crunch).Tiny shop, but they make the most amazing breads and coffee to go with it. Just a fantastic find here in the city- it's a must try! They do take card and cash. Nothing beats warm buns in the SF chills early in the morning. On sunny days, there's benches outside that you can sit on as well!"", ""After all the hype from reviewers on Yelp and word of mouth, I'm sadly disappointed by the baked goods at Neighbor Bakehouse. I had the ginger pull apart, meat pizzetta and raspberry hazelnut double baked croissant to share with my pastry companion. Maybe I'm being too harsh comparing Neighbor to my experiences at B, Arizmendi and Arsicault but it didn't quite cut it in my bakery rankings.The ginger pull apart didn't have enough butter so it tasted a bit dry and stale even though it had clearly been made the same day. The pizzetta was a poorly constructed with high quality ingredients but lacking in seasoning and flavor. I kept wishing I had saved my calories for Arizmendi's sourdough pizza instead. The raspberry croissant was alright with a nice berry taste from the dried raspberry powder on top and gooey hazelnut almond paste in the center. All in all, it's a nice bakery for the Dogpatch and Potrero Hill neighborhood with a pleasant seating area and a decent selection of items. I wouldn't go out of my way to come out here as the pastries just weren't up to my expectations."", ""I hear people talking about the long lines at this place, yet I haven't experienced those yet. Maybe because I come really early in the morning or just before they're closing? (Must be all the techies living in this Area who don't roll out of bed until 9am!)Anyways, I really like this place. Their baked goods, of course, are a delight and I've yet have to have an item that I didn't like. My go-to is the sourdough bread - the one in square format. Ideally they will slice it for me so that i can just put it in a plastic bag and pop it into the freezer: it's delicious for breakfast on the weekends as it pairs so well with my homemade blackberry jam. Aside from their baked goods though, I love the workers' attitude here: I frequent a lot of bakeries all throughout San Francisco and one thing I always note is that the people working their are not very friendly. To the point of being snotty. Here at Neighbor Bakehouse I have only experienced friendly smiles and a welcoming attitude."", ""Neighbor Bakehouse, you never bor me away. This is my all time favorite bakery in San Francisco. Situated right off 3rd street with an expansive outdoor seating area by San Francisco standards, this bakery is hard to miss on weekends as the wait is usually in the range of 20-45 minutes, depending on the time of day. With fresh baked batches of assorted pastries made on site every hour or so, the aromas of the varying depths of flavors - berries; chocolate; pear; ginger; roasted nuts - burst through the air and grab your soul. My favorite picks are:(1) The Cinnamon Almond Bostock - I love this pastry because it is a cross between a French toast and a croissant - the child that got the best genes from both parents. Crisp and buttery on the outside, soft layered and airy on the inside, with the flavor of the roasted almonds and cinnamon throughout. \xa0The perfect start to any day. (2) The ginger pull apart - The way this bread is twisted not only makes this bread a fun pull apart to share with friends, but it is also positioned as to maximize the surface area and optimize the crunch effect - and add to that the flavor of the fiery ginger. This is another classic. (3) The Twice Baked Croissants - I really enjoy the various flavors of the twice makes. The way that the berries complement the herbs, all baked inside a twice baked croissant for that added crunchy texture makes for a complex flavor combination with varying debts of texture. (4) The Kimchee Toast - On top the buttery, fresh thick milk toast are the tart kimchee, scallions, and cheese. \xa0Though I have a sweet tooth, I quite enjoy the savory bread on occasion. \xa0The one thing that makes this one more enjoyable is reheating it - else the kimchee-cheese-scallion is easy to separate from the toast and the situation gets messy. The tea and coffee are also carefully made cup by cup - a good wake up call. Neighbor Bakehouse, I'm so happy we are neighbors."", ""We were craving baked goods after brunch and found this gem on Yelp. There were only a few baked goods left since we stopped by 30 minutes before closing. After being introduced to double baked croissants in Vancouver, I have been trying to find them again and saw that they had twice baked croissants. I ordered the pistachio blackberry twice baked croissant AND OMG IT WAS GOOD. The first bite was crispy from the pistachios on top and the croissant. The pistachio and blackberry layers were weaved on top of each other and the flavor combination really worked well together. However, I wish the pistachio and blackberry ratio was more even because I felt like there was more pistachio than blackberry. Can't wait to try their other twice baked croissants!"", ""Neighbor Bakehouse has the best pastries I've ever stuffed in my face on American soil. The bakery is a stone's throw away from Dogpatch Boulders, so you can easily get your climb on and then your pastry on.I've been here twice with my friend now. Both times the line has been out the door, even in the rain. The first time we got the (1) Ginger Pull-apart, (2) Raspberry Hazelnut twice-baked, (3) Passionfruit Doughp Bun. The second time we got the (1) Everything Croissant and the (2) Guava & Cream Cheese Pastelito. My experiences here have made me question how this place even exists. If I made **anything** as good as these pastries, I would eat them immediately. They wouldn't even have time to be sold.My favorite have to the be the Ginger pull-apart and the Pastelito. My mouth waters and stomach grumbles just thinking about them. Every bite is more savory than the last and when you're out you question why you didn't get more.

If you love the flavor of an everything bagel but you don't like how dense a bagel can be, you'll love the flakiness of the croissant. I recently wrote a review \xa0claiming Arsicault makes the best croissant in the city, but after having this croissant, I'd honestly have to say Neighbor Bakehouse is a close tie. $3.50 for a croissant is not cheap, but it is however, cheaper than the ham and cheese croissant from Arsicault that are closer to $5.50, and certainly worlds better than any croissant you'll find at any cafe for $3.50.I'm definitely coming back to try some of the other pastries, as well as their olive sourdough loaf.""]"

Sometimes the music is being played by a skillful/peaceful/quiet duo while other times it's a full blown loud band that can cramp your style if you're just trying to get some simple cafe ambience while working on something.I also liked how the place was cozy but with large open swinging front doors and big windows, lots of light comes in so you don't feel cooped up and more connected with the Mission district!"", 'I am regular here - work down the street.

Chalos,"['Converted from an Irish breakfast/brunch joint, it cleaned up nicely . \xa0 The owner is very friendly and cares a great deal about service and quality. \xa0Churros are great, not overlay sugared and just the right firmness. \xa0With delicious dipping sauces to boot. \xa0For savory, my favorites are the mushroom and chicken empanadas. \xa0 \xa0With private establishments going in and out of business on a weekly basis in this neighborhood, I hope this ones sticks around. \xa0Damn you SF and your skyrocketing rent hikes.', ""Stopped by and ordered a salad, a baked sweet beef empanada and a baked spicy chicken empanada.At first, I was getting unreasonably annoyed at the wait time (I was being unreasonable; not them) b/c I've been too spoiled by the general food industry's willingness to cater to overly impatient consumers. It took around 20-25 minutes for my 2 empanadas to come out (salad was pre-packaged), but then I remembered that they actually fold the empanada (with filling made each morning) and bake it fresh for each order.They were wonderfully toasty on the outside and warm with delicious flavor on the inside. Well, the chicken one was alrighttttt imo, but I already expected it b/c I generally am lukewarm towards chicken dishes, so that's kinda on me. 2.5/5 spice level (as they described it) was pretty accurate imo. The sweet beef was DELICIOUS and had juices leaking out after each bite.Will definitely be back when I'm in the area!"", 'I really hate to leave a bad comment for any new business, especially a new flavor that is desperately needed in our parkside neighborhood.

Well, I guess I am used to the Mexican style churros I grew up eating in LA. The ones that are about a foot long, soft and cost less than 2 bucks. I understand we are in one of the most expensive cities in the world, so I am forgiving on the high price. \xa0What I am not so lenient on is the customer service. I got the feeling from one of the baristas, a very snobbish, hipster vibe. (so not the vibe in the sunset). I ordered a few orders of churros and they forgot to give me the dulce de leche for one of them. No biggie. As I walked up to the counter and let them know, right away the guy behind the counter asked me for my name and checked my receipt to make sure that I actually purchased the dulce de leche sauce. Like really? am I trying to scam you out of ONE DOLLAR? That left a bad taste in my mouth.They need to take note of the laid back vibe in our community and I believe this establishment will be more enjoyable.', 'When I first heard that an empenada and coffee spot would be opening in the sunset, I was very excited. It seemed like it might fit the laid back and community oriented vibe of this neighborhood, creating a vibrant space for all to enjoy as a meeting place, and infusing new culture into the Taraval corridor.Unfortunately I have yet to have a pleasant experience after giving it a few tries. I figured there would be a few kinks to work out, as is usually the case with a new business. But after my fourth time, I will not be returning. Service is absolutely TERRIBLE. Lines are long, accomadations are cramped and uncomfrotable, and customer service is lacking to say the very least. The owner doesnt seem to know what he is doing AT ALL, both in terms of making coffee or how to treat his customers or staff. As i was attempting to make small talk with one of the baristas, the owner chastised not only him but me as well. Growing pains I can understand. But the lack of discipline is embarassing, and treating staff and customers poorly for trying to be friendly is unacceptable, and does not fit nor is welcomed in this close knit community.

They also have both dessert and savory churros, sandwiches, a full coffee bar, and Bare Bottle beer. The barista made me a delicious hot chocolate that definitely tasted special.The decor is well-done and homey; farm-style with tables and bright blue walls.

Ham and cheese was super cheesy, all kinds of cheese pulls after each bite which I liked, but there was very little ham inside and I could barely taste it. Carne was tasty, full of beef, and very flavorful from the spices, peppers, and onion. This one was one of my favorites and I look forward to trying the Carne Picante my next trip!Spinach and cheese, was the opposite of the ham and cheese, it was LOADEDDD with spinach with less cheese. Still yummy.Overall everything was pretty good, I felt like it was a tad pricey for the size of each empanada, but if I was in the area looking for a snack I would come back again.', 'Ordered their champignones and carne dulce empanadas.

There was no sorry for the inconvenience or anything, \xa0all she said was ""you\'ll just have to wait a couple of minutes"" and turned around to continue doing what she was doing. This could have been (barely) excusable if they posted clear signs that you can\'t order certain items on the menu before a certain time, but there wasn\'t. The cashier in fact had to reconfirm this \'policy\' before saying anything. \xa0They surely went interested in selling me anything this morning, so good luck with business.

If you've already tried the standard churros in SF, this porras are a thicker, more doughy version and well worth a try. This delectable treat may not seem like it would be that addictive, but it really is - once you start dipping, you may eat several churros sticks without even realizing it.As well, this place also sells authentic Argentinian empanadas. The empanadas here reminds of the ones I ate at El Sanjuanino in Bueno Aires. You get the option of either fried or baked, I love both. There were all sorts of empanadas on the menu, such as carne, carne picante, pollo and various vegetarians ones such as provolone, espinaca, choclo, and champignones.I have traveled to numerous places around the world and ate at many outstanding restaurants and I can say this place is legit.

My wife's cafe au lait (coffee and steamed milk) came out like a warm cup of milky water with an espresso shot in lieu of drip coffee. The barista was kind but I'm not inclined to return, mostly due to the unwelcoming experience with the gentleman in the front end. It's not difficult for a business to operate like a good neighbor and this experience fell short of that. If they're going to have a full cafe set up they should have a mastery of making coffee and they should also polish up their interactions with clientele.""]"
Tierra Mia Coffee,"[""One of my biggest pet peeves is when 1 person takes up a whole table for 4 lol. Can't suggest it's always good for groups but definitely a nice place to get some work done. Cute little cafe with amazing drinks. I'm not a coffee expert or anything, but ever since Tierra Mia, I've learned to appreciate coffee. I've tried almost all the frappes by this point and I gotta say Horchata Frappe and the Mexican chocolate frappe are the ones!!! Hot or cold both never disappoint. Sweet. Creamy. Delicious. Really friendly and helpful baristas who will take the time to explain every drink and make it the way you want. Also reasonable prices for some coffee. Free and reliable WiFi as well as a couple outlets on the walls. Worth a try if you're in the area and need a cup of coffee!"", ""I had a good time at Tierra Mia, stopping by for a quick snack and coffee because I had been forced to get up early and rudely denied any coffee prior.The decor here is pretty cool, with some aeronautical antiques and comfortable chairs. It's a very casual place that I can definitely see people lounging around in.The service was very prompt as well, with it only taking a few minutes for my mocha and almond croissant to be delivered.The mocha was good if you like sweet coffee drinks, but to be honest I prefer less sugar and a more intense chocolate flavor. An extra shot of espresso and the removal of half the sugar would have probably been more to my liking. It was good, just too much like dessert for me.The almond croissant was also good, but reheating it by microwaving it doesn't leave me with a very good impression. I'd prefer it was reheated with dry heat, like a toaster oven, rather than internally steamed, which is what microwaving does. It wasn't ruined, just kind of suboptimal to me.Overall, if i were in the neighborhood, I would come here versus Starbucks or Pete's. But I'd go to Blue Bottle or Philz if that was available."", ""Finally some decent Cafe con Leche. It may not have been Miami, but it was pretty close. The staff here was super cool. I would definitely come back in the future to get the Horchata Latte.Tierra Mia Coffee has a nice spacious cafe and the setup reminds me of a few places I've visited in South Florida in the college are by University of Miami. My only disappointment was that they didn't have many Cuban pastries - if they had some guava pastries or some Puerto Rican pastries then this place would be probably the best place I've been to.Still - major points for having a real Latin coffee and not some made up hipster stuff like most of SF."", ""Horchata coffee is why I come here.

Yes, the drinks are awesome here but who can drink them if they close at 5 and or open at 7:30am which is very late for a coffee shop?! The schedule here makes no sense.

I ordered the Horchata Frappe with a shot of espresso added. MmMMmm good. The order came out about three minutes after I ordered it. It was caked in a nice wallop of whipped cream on top. The first sip was bomb oh my goodness so good. It really was an amazing first sip! As time progressed however, I found myself getting overwhelmed by it. It took quite some effort to drink. Maybe ordering a medium for myself wasn't the best idea. I'd be more than elated to come back and order it again in a size small! I was also recommended to try the Coco Loco.

There was a long line at first, but once the line started moving, everything went really quickly. The service was great!Unfortunately, I cannot say the same things about all the food. It was extremely overpriced and some of the pricing modules didn't even make sense. I got 1/2 of an avocado toast and a small yogurt with granola for $16 dollars, when a full avocado toast is $8. If a full avocado toast is $8, then 1/2 of an avocado toast should be $4, right? Then the rest of the meal.. a small yogurt and granola costs $12? It just didn't make complete sense, but I was hungry so didn't really care. Th avocado toast was ok. I actually didn't even finished it because it wasn't anything exceptional. The yogurt and granola was really, really good though! Maybe not $12 good, but good enough to finish the whole thing and feel satisfied (although I'll need another snack in an hr or two). I also got an iced coffee. It was good. I'd come back here, but not for the toasts. There are definitely other things on the menu I'd like to explore (like the aussy latte!"", ""I was about to write a 1 Star review after the fiasco of this place last time when I was in Washington DC, where I didn't get a simple toast until 25 minutes later after I finished my coffee and the latte art got ruined by overpowering amounts of chocolate powder. I decided to give this place another try with the free coffee ticket they gave me for the inconvenience. I decided to check out their Aussie iced latte since after some research, this is an Australian inspired coffee shop. I got it with oat milk, and overall, I really liked it. Same goes for the salmon toast, where all the ingredients are fresh and they put it into a very nice takeout box, similar to when you pull something out of a drawer. It's pretty cute I guess.This time I am far from disappointed. I really enjoyed the food and drink as well as the customer service. I would go back again sometime, when I decide to splurge a little, because this is a very pricey place that would have set me back $19+ if it weren't for the promo and free coffee. Thanks for giving yourself a second chance; you earned back a customer :)"", ""Great spot to catch up with friends over coffee and brunch in San Francisco Financial district. Love their ambience. The interior is so tiny, bright, modern, and Instagram worthy. Also, the coffee and toasts are amazing!!Ordered for 3 ppl:Drinks：Latte: (4.5/5): \xa0good quality coffee beans.Golden Latte (?/5): Not a big fan of cinnamon, and no dare to try a sip. ://Food:Avocado Toast (5/5): The best in the town!!! Love their avocado Toast recipe, fresh smash avocado seasoned w/ lemon juice, salt&pepper , chili flakes &olive oil!! The roast of toast just prefect. Tips: I would like to add some extra on the top next time, such as prosciutto or poached egg. Salmon Toast (4/5): according to my friends' comments. It tastes good but too creamy. Breakfast Bowl (4/5): kale, avocado, cherry tomato, red quinoa & poached egg. Hmmmm.. I can feel the healthiness from the breakfast bowl. Maybe few drop of lemon juice would make the salad bowl taste even better. Croissant (5/5): yummy! Crispy and buttery. Very match with the latte."", ""I went here twice over the weekend. 1. The coffee is great. If you're a blue bottle fan (I am), this is equally good. 2. I also tried the matcha latte on the second day that I went here, it was good. 3. My favourite here was the avocado toast. Nothing complex, simple bread with generous spread of fresh avocados served with salt and paprika drizzle on top. My only minor complaint is that they charge you $1 extra for making your drink extra hot. I find that a bit strange. Else the place is a definitely worth a stop to grab a small bite or get a coffee."", ""I've tried this place a few times for breakfast and I consider it one of my go-to breakfast places when I want to treat myself. Cute little venue, great quality (and fairly healthy) food, nice and attentive staff, slightly pricey menu. I've tried the signature avo toast (with and without poached egg), Australian iced coffee, salmon toast, raspberry almond croissant, chocolate chip cookie, and the lemon blueberry muffin. The toasts are the best thing you could order. Steep price at $9, but it's honestly the best toasts hands down. The bread they use is fantastic in texture with a great balance of chewy, fluffiness and a nutty, toasty exterior. The slice is actually pretty large in size, cut thick, and placed in a cute little box. Both the avo toast and the salmon toast are tasty, but between the two, I prefer the avo toast. Both are pretty generous in toppings and are great quality, but I enjoy the flavors more in the avo toast personally (creamy, citrusy, spicy). The egg is great, a worth-while addition. As for the pastries, I enjoyed them all. The raspberry almond croissant was the most beautiful and my favorite of the three although it was a little too sweet. The lemon blueberry muffin is my next favorite for the simplicity in flavors and sugary, crusty top. The cookie was meant to be eaten with coffee, not on its own which made it less appealing for me since I don't always get coffee. I ordered the Australian iced coffee just because I was curious to know what it was and didn't bother to ask. It's vanilla ice cream in a cup of iced coffee! Actually really great, but not something I would order in the morning often. Overall, a great little cafe worth trying. I'll be back, especially for the avo toast."", ""I've been to one of these in NY so I was excited to try the one here. I went for brunch/lunch with my friend on a Saturday at 12pm. It was starting to empty out, so we were able to get seats. Tables are pretty close together, so seating is a bit tight. I ordered the Market bowl (~$14), which was the same as the Breakfast Bowl (~$14, which my friend got) except had beets, corn, and cucumber. It's a little pricy and something I could make at home, but I do like the combination and it was plated very nicely. My only thing is that while pretty, the avocado did not seem ripe enough yet, and did not taste ripe either. A bit expensive for what it is, but I would come here again for a healthy brunch."", ""Came here per the suggestion of a friend and ordered an Americano for about $5 before tip, which is expensive. It was a decent Americano though. My friend had the avocado toast and an iced coffee for almost as expensive. I guess you're paying for the location. The avocado toast was yummy and served on good bread, which is a plus, but is it worth the price? Meh. The atmosphere is nice, though, and has such great colors for being right next to an alley of homeless people. I don't know if I'll ever choose to come back, but it could be a nice place to have coffee with friends that isn't Starbucks."", ""The first Bluestone Lane I ever tried was in the Financial District in New York and now I'm so happy to see Bluestone Lanes popping up all over the place - even here, in SF! I dropped by on a Friday morning for some avo toast and a golden milk latte. I hadn't had one of these since New York and I was really craving a delicious turmeric drink! Overall, I was pleased by the service (which is amazing!) and the ambiance of the store. It looks lively but also not too much so, as people are able to get their work done in here. The price point is again, quite steep but it's to be expected here in San Francisco. I'd love to return and try some of their coffee here next time!"", ""I love impressing my friends with Yelp discoveries. I'm now the default person for picking places for food and drink, including a 7:00 AM breakfast that my friends and I met up for. Bluestone seemed adorable, and who in San Francisco doesn't love overpriced toast?Pretty sure Bluestone is Australian, judging from the wait staff accents and the vegemite on the menu. Everyone is super sweet, and I love the cute and classy atmosphere. My friend saved seats for the rest of us to arrive. I'd recommend groups of 2 to 4 people max since it's a tight fit. It was surprisingly busy for a weekday morning.We all ordered hot coffee, which came in a glass carafe aside a colorful ceramic mug. For breakfast I got the avocado toast, which was delicious and filling. Whenever we needed something, it seemed like I had to make an effort to flag someone down, but the actual process of ordering and paying was seamless.While I wouldn't rush to come here again, I truly enjoyed my experience and would recommend it to anyone looking for a new spot to check out in the Financial District. It's a few blocks away from Embarcadero Center, and it's open super early! Definitely lots of notable wins."", ""Nice place for a coffee! I went in with the purpose of getting a latte but decided to go for the mocha instead. The mocha was good, enough chocolate and coffee taste. Glad that it wasn't too sweet ! The one caveat is that the place isn't large and doesn't have much seating. Every time I've come the place is quite full and here's always a line. Usually it doesn't take too long but other times it does. Either way, I've always had a good experience coming in and I'd recommend the mocha and the latte. I love that they serve milo, didn't know it was popular in Australia as it is in South America. Will be back!"", ""Fantastic coffee! I met up a buddy of my for coffee and he suggested this place. The cold brew is strong and smooth, as they all should be. Iced and black is how I prefer my coffee. It's slightly pricy for coffee, but I love how places like this thrive in the big city. It was a Tuesday morning, and packed with people taking a break from their busy workday. The place was packed, and the only option was to take our coffee to go. I can't complain though, as it was such a nice day to be walking around the city.I paid with a credit card, and intended to tip with cash but realized that they don't have a tip jar.....Umm y'all should get one."", ""I went for some coffee and was denied service because they wouldn't accept cash. Cash is US currency and is legal tender for all debts, public and private. I'm done with this place. This is discrimination at its best"", 'I came in by invite from Sarah, the wonderful manager who is responding to my feedback from a previous experience at Bluestone Lane. She more than compensated for the mishap the first time, and she was incredibly polite in explaining to me the situation while also taking ownership and addressing my concerns. Regarding the food and drinks, I probably had one of the best slices of avocado toast in my life. The thick yet soft and chewy multigrain toasted bread Supported a bed of smashed avocado along with a perfectly poached egg. The entire creation was drizzled with olive oil and topped with chili flakes. I recommend you eat the toast as soon as possible as the bread will still be warm as well as the egg on top. At this location specifically, you can either dine in with table service, or you can order from the counter. The Bright interior Decour filled with wooden tables plants and glass bottles just feels comforting and clean, and creates a pleasant daytime dining experience. The tables are a little squeezed together, but it does not detract from the meal, as it feels more intimate and cozy than crowdedThey have Wifi as well, and I look forward to coming back.']"
Five Star Truffles Co.,"[""I absolutely love the truffles. Probably the best I ever had. The shop doesn't look like much from the outside but the flavors are very very special and comply make up for it.

The process was extremely smooth. I ordered 16 hazelnut, 8 black and white, 8 caramel, and 8 dark chocolate. It was 36 dollars for the 40 truffles, which comes out to 90 cents each truffle. What a steal! \xa0There was a confirmation email sent to my email, and the order was fulfilled through GrubHub for delivery. It was an estimated 30-40 minutes for delivery, which was extremely accurate. That's faster than if I were to go out to their store, find parking, go inside and order, then go home! I indicated on the delivery notes, that I wouldn't be home and to just drop off the delivery on the porch. A text message was sent to me indicating that the delivery was dropped off. That gave me a sense of reassurance. When I got home, I opened up the packaging, to see the different flavors were put in separate bags and labeled. I put them onto a little tray for the guests when they arrived. The dark chocolate and hazelnut pieces were distinguishable because the nuts used for dark chocolate had a more toasted look. However, I couldn't tell the difference between the black and white pieces with the caramel pieces. Both of those flavors were coated with cocoa powder on the outside. Not a big deal since my guests have no allergies to anything. The only downside are that you can tell these truffles are definitely handmade. Normally, that would be a good thing! But these were a little on the not pretty side as they were rolled in non-uniform circles. It seemed like they didn't put that much effort in making them look pretty. They still tasted delicious. I would definitely come back here in person when I have more time."", ""Considering how much we enjoy strolling the Castro, Jamie W. and I rarely find ourselves walking on 18th Street west of Castro Street. No particular reason. I just think people like us get used to their routines, which is my roundabout way of saying we had no idea this shop existed until we saw the sandwich board that announced free truffles inside (photo: bit.ly/2kBntdo). Now why would we pass up an opportunity like that? I wanted a little caffeine after dinner, so the idea of buying a $2.25 cup of coffee seemed reasonable to me for a mouthful of sweetness (photo: bit.ly/2kBvrD4).Now choosing which truffle turned into quite a challenge as the display case was full of all sorts of variety from peanut butter to cinnamon dark chocolate to rum coco to even vegan truffles (photo: bit.ly/2laYj2p). I settled on the hazelnut once which was covered in them in pulverized form (photo: bit.ly/2jQlahQ). Oh yes, that was certainly a pop of goodness well worth the mediocre, overheated cup of coffee I bought. Should I come back for the $33 40-piece gift box or the $45 60-piece gift box?

But we don\'t want just any donut... we\'re not in it fir the sugar. In fact, a donut that\'s too sweet gets a thumb down by our vote. We want to taste to varying flavors and interesting combinations which is just what we get at Dynamo. Today we drooled one of over our favorites, milk chocolate passion fruit. And yes we tasted the passion fruit. We also had zucchini oat which had a nice moistness to the dough. Then we bought our friends donuts too. Although one didn\'t appreciate the quality so he won\'t be getting another. We come all the way from Santa Cruz on our way to our volunteer shift once a week. Every visit feels good because we are greeted by nice people who listen as we rave and question each donut. Nd they almost get into with us sharing their favorites... and sometimes they even throw in a free one... because ""you have to try all the flavors.""Tips..... you have to try the maple bacon. Coffee is great with them all, and they serve a good cup. If they\'re serving up something savory that day, throw that in to your order. We\'ve had the savory quiche and bread pudding and were impressed. A couple times we\'ve gone for a dozen, not a cheap thing to do.

I initially thought of practicing my self control and getting just 2 but, as you can see from my photo, that did not happen... Rough life, I know. My two favorites:The Caramel de Sel is just salty enough to really bring out the sweetness of the caramel. I would be perfectly happy if I could just spend the rest of my life eating the caramel de sel icing with a spoon.

So here\'s the thing, I\'m not ever super into maple anything or savory donuts. But this is not a savory donut. The glaze was more of a vanilla ganache with maple flavoring- not like they poured Aunt Jemima all over it. The donut was light yet crispy; almost like a cream puff with a sweet glaze and candied bacon. Ohhhhh myyy!! Too good to pass up. My second favorite was the vegan Lemon Thyme. The donut itself was crispy and made with plantains so it was extremely moist inside. Even though it was vegan, it didn\'t taste ""vegan"". Well executed and delectable with the delicate fresh thyme. Caramel de sel is a classic. Traditional cake donut with thick, authentic caramel poured over. Also a winner. The vanilla milk chocolate donut was similar to that of a cookies and cream but for some reason it was dry and not as good as the others. It was missing that pizzazz. Same with the sweet potato marshmallow donut. It was missing that WOW factor- even with a homemade marshmallow on top. The donut was hard, tasted grainy and dry. The texture wasn\'t light or fluffy like a fresh donut should be. Would definitely pass on that one. They have a few staples but lots of seasonal flavors that come and go.

The bacon flavor is infused into the yeast dough itself, so you\'re hit with a beautiful blend of sweet and savory in every bite. I just wish they were larger. Also, their beer-week special (chocolate vanilla base dipped in Almanac Stout glaze and topped with Irish Whiskey buttercream and a sprinkle of sea salt and cacao nibs) was reminiscent of a cinnamon bun and deserves a shoutout as well.I\'d be hard pressed to travel to the mission just for this shop, but I wouldn\'t hesitate to order delivery (kudos to them for being the only donut shop available through Caviar!) BTW, the open-view kitchen would be great for donut making workshops for company offsites (Sign me up if this becomes a thing!)']"
