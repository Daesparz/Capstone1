Description,Rating
$6.50 for a turmeric matcha seems a bit steep but... I guess Lower Haight is coming up in the world. I had to put my headphones on because this place is teeny-tiny and the two gals working there were ranting back and forth about work drama. That's fine just not super professional. No biggie though. They have WiFi which is why I stopped in. The barstools are not very comfortable though - this is the kind of place that obviously wants their customers in and out.,3.0 star rating
"It's not a far cry to say it's one of my favorite coffees in the city. Beans are great ( Temple ) & truth be told, I'm addicted to their butterscotch latte - 1/2 sweet, with almond milk, and every time - they deliver with a smile. All of them, which is a f'in rarity these days. The coffee isn't the only thing that's warm here :) I just moved closer to the neighborhood and couldn't be happier to start my mornings/kick start my afternoons with one of their bevs. Plus, it's a locally owned by amazing women, and I can't not support them. Take my money guys, I'll be back for another tomorrow ;)",5.0 star rating
"This place is fantastic - for coffee, toast, and friendly baristas/owners! It is owned and operated by a lovely set of twin ladies. This hits home for me as my twin and I have always dreamed of opening up our own coffee shop :). I ordered the dirty turmeric chai and it was delicious! A perfectly balanced drink. They happily accommodated my request of 2% milk - it's rare these days to find that as places only carry skim and whole milk.We also order the Pesto Tomato Toast and holy moly it was superb. The pesto was so good! And they use the perfect bread for avo toast - nicely grilled. As a millennial, I approve! They also have gluten free bread to accommodate those with dietary restriction.This cute cafe had a constant flow of folks coming in and out and for good reason! I highly recommend coming her for your joe and toast :). Best of luck to these ladies!",5.0 star rating
"Stopped in on our way out of San Fran because it was close to our AirBnb. The coffee was GREAT. I got a latte with an extra shot made with oat milk and it was super good. My roommate got the cold brew and enjoyed it also.Honestly, the only thing keeping this from a 5 star review was the avocado toast. I got it to-go so didn't even look at it until we got in the car. I probably just misread the description, but it was a couple slices of avocado on a piece of bread... I know, that's literally ""avocado toast."" It's just not the normal mashed plus some extra seasoning/veggies/whatever that I'm used to. Like I said, coffee and everything else was great though!",4.0 star rating
Cute very friendly coffee shop on Divis. I got a cortado and it was very good. I've heard their food is also good. There is a small bench with a table on the sidewalk. Nice neighborhood spot. Very relaxed.,5.0 star rating
Just discovered this tiny place as I was walking down Divisadero. The pastry and the mocha were a bit too sweet for my taste but pretty good nonetheless,4.0 star rating
"I come here a couple of times a week before my morning walk, and it is a perfect way to start my day.  Very approachable team, superb coffee and espresso selection, although I always get the cold brew (sorry for taking so much of it!).  They have all the milks (oat, cream, almond, etc. etc.) if needed.  Also have pricey but DELICIOUS baked goods like donuts, bars, and natural pop-tarts etc.Not a ton of seating, have a good bar in the front and side to have a seat, but perfect community coffee shop for a cup to go.",5.0 star rating
"I really loved Native Twins! I just stopped in for a cold brew in the morning, and I enjoyed the whole experience! The flavor of the coffee was incredible, the service was quick and friendly, and I loved the ambiance. I will definitely be back next time I'm in San Francisco!",5.0 star rating
"The lattes at Native Twins are absolute perfection. I used to get the espresso latte, but I stopped drinking coffee/espresso several months back and switched to the matcha latte (also have tried the turmeric and chai latte). Whatever the latte, it's always delicious and the perfect temperature (I find that a lot of coffee shops steam their latte milk way too hot, which is a big no no). The matcha latte, specifically, is smooth, earthy, and not overly sweetened. I've had a lot of matcha lattes from other coffee shops in various places and I always find myself judging them against Native Twins' because it's my gold standard that remains unparalleled.  I could be biased because, beyond the drinks, the owners/baristas are wonderful: their service is warm and quick. The eponymous twins run a lovely coffee shop that epitomizes what a great local business is and makes me proud to live in the Nopa area.",5.0 star rating
"Okay so there are several coffee places to choose from on Divisadero in Lower Haight, but this one is definitely my favorite. First, the coffee shop is super cute, the walls covered with record albums. Second, the coffee is really good. It is a bit pricier than I might normally spend on coffee but its definitely of quality. The only downside to the place is that it's not very big so I wouldn't plan on hanging out there. They did have some outside seating on the sidewalk however.",5.0 star rating
"Love this spot. Pretty small but with a large personality. Very kind staff, good coffee, and yummy avocado toast. Got the garlic variation which was a bit intense recently but the traditional is extremely tasty.",5.0 star rating
"One of my favorite coffee shops in the city! Their coffee is just perfect! Not weak, not too strong (burnt), just right! I also love their little muffins! Perfect place, great location, nice service! Totally recommended!!! :)",5.0 star rating
"I love Native Twins. Their coffee is amazing, trust me, I am Italian. Their avocado toast is the best, trust me, I am a Millennial. Jokes aside, I really like this spot, their home made granola is excellent, and so are their pastries, from the same lab as Cibo in Sausalito.The Mill Valley twins are fun to chat to and they have an extensive record collection, plus it's really nice to be able to order ""the usual"", as there isn't the barista turnover you see in other coffee places in the area.I totally recommend it!",5.0 star rating
"Great vibes here all around. Plenty of dogs and good food and snacks. Women owned business. Great ambiance great coffee free WiFi. I ordered pluot toast, turmeric green tea latte with oak milk. I discovered both pluot jam and oak milk on my visit there. They were kind enough to explain it to me. I can't wait to go again",5.0 star rating
"I love this place. I try to come as much as I can because this really is my favorite coffee shop. As a former barista/coffee snob, this place has everything you look for. Great beans, great people, and that intimate feel that makes a local coffee shop part of the neighborhood. You can't miss with their cold brew!",5.0 star rating
"Tried this spot a little while back and it was okay! The spot is easy to miss but once discovered, it's super cute and the staff is really friendly. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed by the coffee. I got the coconut & butter latte and my sister got the vanilla bean. The flavors just weren't there. When I tried my sister's, it tasted exactly like mine -- just a plain latte. Bummer because it's a $5 coffee. The morning bun was delicious though! Maybe it was an off day but I don't plan on returning to this location.",3.0 star rating

"I really love this place! Delicious lattes with so many different milk replacement options. Soy, heavy cream, almond milk, etc. This beats sight glass for sure! Tasty toast and pastries as well. It's a local business owned by 2 lovely twin sisters that are super nice. Support!",5.0 star rating
"Native Twins is a cozy little cafe nestled in the hills of the Haight district. Jen (who usually helms the coffees/teas) is a magician of a barista. I've never had cappucinos or pour over coffee quote like hers, and she shows her expertise and care without a doubt. Ashley made my toast today and I was beyond impressed. As a consumer, I've always enjoyed simple yet delicious foods, and these toasts theyvenconcocted are just that. I ended up not only getting the avocado toast, but the garlic butter and then a third on the sweeter side - cinnamon! Everything was amazing. The decor is very sleak, the ambience terrific, all with the steady backdrop of classic rock&roll. (Check out their posters on the wall!) Even though I live across the Bay in Berkeley I will for sure be back!",5.0 star rating
"Another cafe that has been on my bookmark in like forever, and I finally had the time to check it out.We came Tuesday morning around 10am hoping that it would not be packed but it was. As we were in line I tried to look for a table and was lucky enough to find one as a group of people were just leaving.We ordered birthday latte (duh! that's why I wanted to go here, lol), cookie monster latte, hot chocolate, cinnamon toast, egg in a basket and condensed milky way toast. Everything was really good. The lattes were not too sweet, they were perfect. The latte art were so cute! It's making me want to learn how to do them =)I can't wait to go back and try the rest on the menu!",5.0 star rating
"It's an alright spot if you're nearby. My dentist happens to be closeby. This spot is definitely over hyped now. You will come if you have a habit of IGing your coffee or cafe foods. That being said, the one in the Richmond is better.Things to note:-Nice place to work only if you don't mind the noise level. Between the music, espresso machine, patrons, and cafe worker's friends it can get loud even with headphones so bring your noise cancellers.-The specialty coffees are super high in calories and sugar. They don't serve nonfat or unsweetened almond milk. -Dont get the cookie monster. It tastes like a butter stick fell into your already-bland milk laden coffee.-Nothing special to say about the drip coffee. The roasts are a little watery so it's a bit bland but its the healthiest thing on thr menu probably.-If youre going to IG, get the birthday cake for the rainbow latte. If you care, request for a specific picture or youll get something normal like a heart.-My biggest disappointment: It's freezing in here. Bring a jacket or layer up if you plan on working in here. They won't close the door due to ADA reasons--which I understand and am all for the accommodations but I have never seen a shop or restaurant have a door that absolutely must be kept wide open 'due to ADA'. You can't just close the door and leave it a little ajar instead of freezing your patrons? With 50 degree weather i don't know any place in SF that leaves their doors wide open. Stop by if you're nearby or need a spot to work. But unless you're planning to take a selfie with your coffee, skip this spot as destination.",3.0 star rating
"So cute and such a fun place to study or chat with friends! I ordered the birthday cake latte, and my friend ordered the red velvet latte. Both were incredible! I personally like my lattes on the sweeter side, so the birthday cake latte was perfect :) I had a sip of my friend's latte as well, and I loved it as well!Would definitely recommend coming, and would recommend both lattes!",5.0 star rating
"Drink wise, I thought the lavender latte was tasty. It had a light lavender flavor that paired well and didn't overpower the flavor of the latte. I also really liked their pesto chicken toast, but I was disappointed to find out when I came back for a second time that they took it off the menu.",4.0 star rating
"Cute little coffee shop in the area. Trying to find a breakfast spot with no line or wait is difficult, especially on a weekend. HOME has fast friendly service. Their lines move pretty quick and since the food is simple, there is barely any wait. They have tables and bar style seating inside. Since many people like to come and hang out or do work on their laptops here, there are specific tables where it is strictly for eating/enjoying coffee AND tables that you can use your laptop at.......I like that concept. The menu is limited to coffee drinks, a few toasts, and pastries. Simple. Their drinks are tasty and most important.... pretty and instrgramable!",5.0 star rating
One of the reasons my friends and I stopped by here was because of the cool latte art. The menu is filled with various different lattes to choose from. I went for the hazelnut latte which was very good. They also have options if you're lactose intolerant. Did you know oat milk is a thing? Well I didn't till I came here and apparently when swapped with regular milk in lattes it's barely noticeable that it's not regular milk! The workers were super nice and very helpful about any questions I had. They also have types of toast if you want a little snack as well. I did not get the chance to try it but I definitely will the next time I am here.What's not to love about this cafe? From it's cute and simple decor you really can't go wrong. It's the perfect place to bring your laptop and get some work done while enjoying a latte. It is a bit small so it can fill up quickly so my suggestion is come a little early if you're planning on hanging out for a bit.,5.0 star rating
"We tried out Home in the Outer Sunset, it was only 1 mile from the dumpling place but hubby didn't want to walk so we took Uber/Lyft - one of those car service.I ordered birthday cake latte $5.75 - it's very colorful artwork and has candy sprinkles on top.  I liked it.Hubby got Cappuccino and it had a nice cappuccino art on it.Lots of folks in there.  I can see it being very busy on weekends, glad we tried it on a weekday.",4.0 star rating
"So disappointed. I trekked all the way out here to get a cool design on my latte only to receive a heart?! The cashier told me all the lattes came with the cool designs when I asked. I was furious when I picked it up from the counter and saw that heart. Also, they charge extra for milk substitutes-sorry I'm LACTOSE-INTOLERANT! Don't punish me by charging extra for it. They don't make their own syrups in house which also makes it not worth the high price tag. A place back home that I love makes their own syrups and their lattes are less than this. I had the coconut vanilla latte. It was good, but nothing special.I could've spent this $6.50 on dessert or better food. The positive is that Home is a conducive place to studying. They have a long line of tables and chairs set up and outlets. The first few tables have a no laptops sign, just a heads up.",3.0 star rating
"Cute interior, can get very crowded and seating is difficult. This place is worth visiting if you're in the area and have never been.My lavender chai tasted watered down, I couldn't taste the lavender. I tried my friends' drinks and they were better - maybe it was just a bad order.I'll visit again with friends but if I'm just looking for a to-go order, I'd probably stop by Henry's a couple of blocks down instead.",4.0 star rating
"Overly rated coffee and tea shop. Suppose to be ""laptop free"" on the weekends, yet this is not enforced so there's no where to sit and enjoy your pretty looking 12oz  cup of coffee for $5.75.

"This is def a cute but quality coffee shop. Every time I come here, the workers are extremely nice and awesome. Most times, it's pretty packed and may be hard to get a table, but there are ""no laptop"" tables which are nice. Menu is very large so there's options for everyone!! Their specialty lattes (birthday cake, red velvet, rose, lavender, etc) are priced higher than regular but think they're so much fun and actually really good. Drinks are well made and very enjoyable to drink!! Other than their classic menu, they have other specialty menu items like affogatos and teas!! Food wise, they have toasts that are really good as well and offer third culture pastries ( a plus!!!!) they're so good!!Overall, love this place and come in when I can. It just gets really busy at times of day and I like to sit and enjoy my coffee!!",5.0 star rating
"I've been here a couple of times and this place is so cute!! I always get the lavendar latte... seriously one of my favorite lattes ever! Love coming here on an early weekend morning, sipping coffee and people watch. I've had the avocodo toast here and it is delicious! This place is always  packed with people studying. Really don't know how people can study in such a loud space. But the tables are usually occupied with students. Your best bet is to sit by the window or take your coffee to go.",5.0 star rating
"I dragged my boyfriend here for the cute basic lattes. We came at noon on a holiday and it was packed. Like packed to where we were unable to get a table, and ended up consuming our drinks and food while standing. Not a big deal because we just used the little counter area by the door. For drinks, we ordered the Cookie Monster Latte and the Birthday Cake Latte. Although they were cute, they didn't taste any better than a typical latte from most other coffee shops. For noms, we ordered the Bravo and the Truffle Pesto Toasts. The bravo was your typical avocado toast with some bacon and radish. Compared to other avo toasts you can get in the city, this one failed to impress due to the lack of seasoning (not even pepper?) The truffle pesto toast served on a fluffy thick slice of bread with cherry tomatoes was much better, super yummy! Service was meh. The kitchen accidentally made us the kimchi toast instead of the Bravo Toast. Normally, we would just eat an incorrect order to avoid being annoying, but since neither of us likes kimchi, we asked to get our toast corrected. At first we were told we could keep the wrong toast since they were just going to throw it out, and then I was called over and told they actually want it back...interesting. They did give us the correct toast pretty speedily though. Overall, unless I'm trying to have something cute on my Instagram story I wouldn't come back.",3.0 star rating
Came here to do some work with a few friends.It's a bit noisy if you want to get work done without any headphones. The drinks are pretty good. The toasts are delicious. their latte art is on point.

Both are just soooooo good !!",5.0 star rating
"What a cute cafe with such beautiful and unique drinks! Seeing all the pictures on Yelp I had to go for the birthday cake latte (even though the cookie monster latte was a close second choice...next time!). The birthday cake latte doesn't actually taste like birthday cake and I believe has a vanilla and hazelnut base. It's not too sweet (granted I probably have a higher sweet tolerance) and is deliciously aromatic. Service can be a little slow since I'm sure the latte art takes awhile to create! You may also have to wait a bit for a table as the spot is pretty popular and can get crowded. Be prepared for lots of girls sitting nearby squealing over the drinks and getting pics for the 'gram =P. Kinda far away from where I live in North Beach so I don't think I'll be coming here on a regular basis, but definitely worth a visit if you're in the Sunset area!",4.0 star rating
"Came here to get some work done and overall, it was a pretty chill experience.Walking in around 10AM it was pretty busy already. Luckily I found a tight spot (in between 2 people) on the bar in front of the window. I ordered the Cookie Monster latte which was 'eh', nothing great. The cookies inside were a little stale, maybe from the heat of the coffee. And I ordered the toast with tomatoes, pesto, truffle, and mozzarella, adding a fried egg on top and it was pretty good! I got a few people asking me what I ordered because it looked so good. For the 2 items I paid around $16 which I found pretty overpriced but it's a SF cafe, what else could I expect?Knocking down 1 star because I wish they offered more outlets to charge your laptop, specifically at the bar. Also because I still found it to be a little overpriced as previously mentioned. But hey, this was all part of the SF cafe experience ultimately!",4.0 star rating
"I love home! Came here for the first time earlier this week on a Tuesday at 10am and there were plenty seats available to study/do work. The drink selections all sounded soooo good, but I opted for the Holy Cow which contains condensed milk. I'm not much of coffee/latte drinker because caffeine usually gives me a headache but the drink I had was perfect and didn't give me that after feeling I usually have with coffee.I also ordered a toast - the bacon, avocado and radish toast. I thought it was a bit expensive at $7, but it was healthy and filled me up, so it did the deed. Free WiFi here with outlets and plenty of seats. Friendly workers. 10/10 would recommend.",5.0 star rating
"Cute little place. Very clean, modern, light, hipster.It's very much a quintessential San Francisco Cafe, which means it's pretty good.My Tomato oil truffle pesto toast was good. Classic toast really. I'm not a huge fan of the super light and thick piece of toast, but it was still good. You know, $7 is ridiculous, but that's the going rate in the City, so it's not really a knock to them.My Lavender Latte was sweater than expected, but that's my bad for not asking I suppose. They coffee itself was good, but I was disappointed it didn't taste more like lavender. In the future I'd try their plain coffee instead of getting ""creative."" It did have some very nice latte art in though. Effort appreciated. It's a nice touch that they have some tables that are designated not for laptops!",4.0 star rating

My friend recommended Home for tasty latte creations on the sweeter side.I managed to steal just a few sips of husband's Nutella mocha.

"This a great joint to try just for the cute coffee art.  They give double shots of espresso in the cup.  The latte are huge.  They customize your drinks and have good service to cater to your tastes.  They're known for their specialty drinks like the birthday latte.  Though many of them have too much syrup and they're too sweet that takes away the coffee flavor.  It would be nice to have natural flavors for specialty drinks.  I also like they have a variety of toasts, both sweet and savory.  The savory ones could be a good snack or a meal if you're not hungry.  I will have to come back and try one of their toasts. The seats aren't that comfortable, so it's not an ideal place to come and read/work for a long time.  They also have signs on some tables that forbid you to bring a computer.",4.0 star rating

"Coffee is an art form at this charming neighborhood favorite haunt. Home pumps out espresso drinks and other concoctions that are beautifully crafted and Instagrammable. Beyond your vintage coffee, the trendy affogato, teas, a classic lineup of coffee bar fare with a unique twist from the ""Truffle In Paradise"" to ""Seoul Much Avo"" and much more are sported on their menu. We tasted through their favored Hazelnut Latte with the flavors of hazelnut being upfront and centered. Pleasantly smooth. Cookie Monster with the cookie garnishes was whimsical and enjoyable! The cookies gave body and enhances the flavors. Birthday Cake was my absolute favorite! A smooth and creamy vanilla latte with a hint of hazelnut and the rainbow sprinkles added a nice texture making this drink ridiculously tasty! The Kouign Amann had a soft and buttery interior with a flaky exterior was imply delicious! The perfect pairing to your drink!

Okay, I won't get psychological on you here.I tried the matcha latte, and the staff will adjust the sweetness level accordingly. My friend enjoyed her chai latte. They're known for the birthday latte with colorful art, though I passed because I don't enjoy too much sweetness. Very friendly customer service, as well. It was busy on a Saturday morning.

"This was my second time at Home, the first time being at the other location in Outer Sunset where I got the famous Birthday Cake Latte. My friend and I had a wonderful time sitting and talking for an hour while enjoying our warm drinks, sheltered from the cold SF weather. The adorable latte art brightened our day (my latte had Totoro!) and is the reason I would come again, just to admire the cuteness and creativity. Food:- Cookie Monster Latte--$5.50The cookie butter did not overpower the coffee and instead added a pleasant sweetness to it. The latte was milky and smooth, and the little bits of melted cookie butter remains at the bottom of the cup were sweet and addicting. Little cookies on top of the latte were still a little crunchy, and even better when dunked in the latte.Tips:- We arrived around 4 pm on a Friday and there were a couple of seats available. It's better to enjoy your drinks in the store so you can enjoy the latte art so come during an off hour!",4.0 star rating
Great little place! food and drinks are delicious. It was my first timing visiting this place with some friends and i loved it. The only concern i have is that it's super crowded in there since it's a small place. We ended up standing while eating and drinking. We had no place tosit since a lot of people were just sitting and chatting away. Other than that it's worth it.,4.0 star rating
"This coffee shop will make you feel right at home! Excellent customer service, great coffee, and good food. Initially came here so my friend could take pictures for instagram, but definitely enjoyed the experience and drinks. My first visit I got the lavender latte. If you're into floral tastes, it is worth a try! My friend had the birthday cake latte which was okay but really pretty. Definitely get it if you want to do it for the gram. I've also tried their London Fog, Cookie Monster Latte, Jasmine Lavender Tea Latte, and Cold Brew. All are solid choices! My friend let me have a bite of one of their avocado toasts and it was delicious! What I love the most is their service! With each visit, the employees were super friendly and made me feel at home (haha). Seriously, they were very welcoming, helpful when it came to any questions, and very good at making conversation that didn't feel awkward at all. It was impressive how a short interaction like that while me ordering and paying was so impressionable!I love the ambience. The way the natural light hits during the day makes it bright. Such a great place to catch up with friends over coffee. I've never studied there but the people who do, look productive and I feel like the environment is conducive for doing work. Parking is on the street so you may have to enjoy a little walk if you get a spot that's further. Worth giving it a try! Definitely coming back!",5.0 star rating
"I'm a fan girl. I'll be the first to admit it. I've had this cafe bookmarked ...for a while... and finally made it in after the most wonderful birthday hike everrrrrrrrr :] ok, maybe second best birthday hike ever - Multnomah Falls certainly trumps all, BUTHeading (to) Home was the absolute best way to close off the evening,*insert baby girl sideways smile*They certainly make you feel at home here while you're ordering up a coffee or tea. You're extended a warm welcome the moment you step through their doors by staff behind the counter along with a, 'how's your day going?' We don't get those too much nowadays...it's certainly the little things that matter and create an environment that's personable and detail oriented - down to their beverages. I myself haven't had any of their fancier/unicorn decorated drinks but have had their more basic (beeyotch) coffee drinks (check my pics) which were definitely palate approved as I have been back a few times already. Maybe next time I'll have that rainbow unicorn drink. I'm gonna do like the kids today say: YOLO. Is that right?!",4.0 star rating
"The space is super cute, clean, and welcoming. The toasts and drinks are super creative and yummy, and they do an amazing job with espresso drinks/ tea lattes etc. My favorite is the avocado toast with kimchi (add an egg on it!). There are no-laptop tables, and laptop/study tables, which I like, whether or not I am coming in to study or to hang out and grab coffee. I never see just a swamp of studiers camping out in there -- which can be annoying even for someone who does frequent cafes for that reason. My only complaint is that the toasts seem a bit too expensive (don't get me wrong, they are de-li-cious) and also the coffee here is bland/watery/weak. I grabbed both house-drip and pour over. I understand some people might get disappointed even at a good cup of pour over because they are mostly light/medium roasts, but this wasn't a flavorful light roast, it was more a bland coffee water. Stick to the espresso drinks or something creative, grab a toast, and it's still a very nice experience!",4.0 star rating

"Doing errands in the Richmond and happened to walk by this place near Little Russia.   The inside decor is modern and very clean and the staff is uber friendly.    I just had a strong coffee at Turtle Tower so decided to roll with the organic tea selection they had.    The place is busy for a Thursday afternoon and seating is hard to come by.    It seems like most of the people are actively working and it is a little noisy, but I have headphones and like the environment.  They have good latte and drip coffee selections so I'll definitely try that next time and update my review.      The coffee setup in the back is nice and clean and they also have lots of instagrammable food options i'll have to try too.",5.0 star rating
I love coming here whenever I am in the city! The first time I came here was for the beautifully designed latte art that had such a vibrant color. Not only was the drinks super delicious but the baristas were all very nice and took their time to try and perfect the drink they were making for you.Loved the customer service and always try to make it back out to the cafe whenever I am in the area! The atmosphere is very home like and cozy. Pay this place a visit it's definitely worth it!,4.0 star rating
"I visited this place a while ago and I still remember how I killed my first drink so quick and got a next round. Usually that happens at a bar, but guess what! their coffee were so good. I start ed with Cookie Monster-Gato and got their Nutella Latte next. Loved both ! Definately wanna bring my other girl friends here. They all gonna love this spot.",4.0 star rating
"Came here with some friends and we were super indecisive with what to get as everything on the menu looked so good! The baristas were beyond friendly and so helpful when it came to questions and recommendations on what to get, definitely some of the best customer service I've ever had. I finally decided on the birthday cake latte with oat milk, that I didn't even know was a thing, but it was seriously one of the best lattes I've ever had. Also, how cute is that latte art?! The interior was bright and minimalistic, and is a great spot to socialize with friends or get some studying/ work done. They also have various types of toasts if you're hungry, but you can't go wrong with any of the crafted drinks.",5.0 star rating

All the workers here are always so friendly and super sweet! My favorite drink on their menu is the holy cow which is espresso shots with condensed milk! YUMMS! they also offer a variety of lattes with art on them. Would definitely come back to try their toast selections !",5.0 star rating
"Love the vibe in this cozy little space! It's chic and modern without feeling obnoxious. Very communal and vibrant. I've been here many times and have never been disappointed by any of the coffees, teas, and matcha drinks. Don't think you can go wrong with any selection. I also appreciate the cute little cups and mugs when you order your drink to stay. I recently came for a quick breakfast pastry, but was pleasantly surprised by a pretty extensive breakfast menu. It was rough to choose btw all the fresh, healthy looking options, but I ended up going with the prosciutto and egg avo toast-- highly recommend!! It came out so fast and was such a perfect blend of flavors on top of a very generous layering of avo slices. I'm still dreaming about this one! Planning to come back very soon.",5.0 star rating
"Folks, avoid this place unless you like being treated like you're transparent. I went for a quick cappuccino only since they're always out of food by early afternoon. The girl behind the counter walked over and stared at me...no smile, no greeting, just stared. I said hello...again nothing but a stare. I then said good afternoon and her response was, ""I said hello already"" and then again just stared. Not, ""what can I get you sir?"" or ""can I take your order?"".  Then she proceeded to walk away.Whoever is the manager, seriously pay more than the likely minimum wage and get real help. There are at least six coffee places in a two block radius and only so many people willing to put up with idiots who don't realize that our patronage is what pays their wages.",1.0 star rating

"It was rainy and I was looking for a place to retreat. I've passed Reveille before, so I decided to make my first stop to do some reading and studying.AMBIANCE is beautiful on the outside. The white chairs paired with thick unstained wood adds a nice vibe to the shop. I was a little underwhelmed when I got to the inside. The natural light was soon replaced with yellow as I made my way to the tight seating spaces. ORDERED regular coffee.DRINK was just fine. I wish I ordered food (the food I had at the Duboce Park location was fantastic), but the menu looks great.OVERALL a terrific three stars. Perhaps on a sunny day I will grab a seat outside!",3.0 star rating
"This is a cute coffee shop, I love the ambiance, the coffee and service are great. The only downside to coming to this cafe is that they only have one outlet making it hard to charge devices while working, the one outlet they do have is VERY loose (meaning your charger will fall out of it). Other than that, nice and friendly environment. Remember, no wifi on the weekends. Enjoy!",4.0 star rating
"I wanted to like this place, however the ventilation is so poor in this Cafe and the smell of bleach permeated the coffee shop. Not only that, I saw cleaning supplies left carelessly outside the bathroom which I thought was very sloppy. Though the furniture is nice and the food is okay, this major detail of bleach was so bad. My coffee tasted of bleach because of the smell. By the end of my time drinking coffee here, my eyes were burning. I wish I were not exaggerating because I really wanted to like this place in the Castro, but I think the management needs to rethink the way they do hygiene at the coffee shop. I think that once they fix this problem, this coffee shop has lots of potential of being the ideal coffee shop in the Castro.",2.0 star rating
"A spot that seemed to be dominated by people working, Reveille didn't have the same warmth that other cafes in SF have, but they still serve up a nice latte. Literally every table inside was occupied by one person on a computer or a phone, all in a line facing the counter. It felt like a satire.That being said, the area in the front seems better for gathering with a friend and feels a bit organic. My latte was solid, though there seemed to be something missing from my friend's dirty chai, maybe a little less chai than expected, as it was missing some of the earthy and spiciness we usually associate with dirty chais. Can't win them all, but still a fine choice.",3.0 star rating

"It's a modern style coffee bar in the heart of the Castro district. I came here for breakfast one weekend morning and had the ""Shakshuka,"" a bold breakfast item that consisted of a poached egg that was swimming in chickpeas, some spicy tomato sauce, which I think had some jalapenos even, although my memory is a bit fuzzy. I also had one of their very smooth and strong cups of coffee.Let me just say that the Shakshuka and coffee did not go together like two peas in a pod. Next time, I'd probably opt for the more traditional breakfast sandwich (which looks delicious from the pictures), but I did enjoy all the flavors of the Shakshuka; it was great to try it once, but it just felt weird eating something like that for breakfast with a hot cup of coffee. Guess I'm just not used to it.A+ gold star for myself for a healthy choice though! I enjoyed the atmosphere here, especially in the morning with the electronic music playing; felt like I was in a fancy hotel lobby or something..ha.",4.0 star rating
"I was here the first time today and my first impression is so great. My first impression might have been impacted by my 1 min visit to next door Starbucks though. The vibe is so great here, especially compared to next door Starbucks. They have a patio-like outdoor area as well which worked just great for me today. I enjoyed fresh air outside a bit, read some article and keeps moving to my next destination. Next time I'll spend more time here.",5.0 star rating

"How did I get so lucky to have Réveille Coffee Co. as my neighborhood coffee shop? Réveille is the perfect mix of hipster, modern and chic and located in the heart of the Castro. They offer full breakfast and a wide variety of sweet and savory items, ranging from avocado toast (because duh!) to scones and almond croissants. Their coffee is top-notch and the baristas know damn well how to make a latte look like a piece of art.Did someone say, ""On Wednesday's we wear pink?"" because at Réveille, two charming baristas - Oscar and Dan - coordinate their outfits (which are always on fleek) and fill the space with energy and create a sense of community I'm happy to be a part of. If you have the time, be sure to give them a visit and leave a tip for their excellent customer service.",5.0 star rating

"I have been a Réveille customer since they opened their doors. This morning I went in to have breakfast. As I place my order at the register I was informed that I was 4 minutes late for the breakfast menu... REALLY? If they are that anal about timing...TAKE THE DAMNED MENU OFF THE COUNTER SO YOUR CLIENTELE IS NOT DISAPPOINTED and SHOW SOME FLEXIBILITY. What ? Do the eggs disappear when the clock strikes 10:30? Never to return. Le Marais is a much friendlier place. today, a few weeks later, I thought I'd give the place another shot. THE SERVICE STILL SUCKS. The guy, barista?, was so busy chatting and dancing around that it took him 15 minutes to prepare an americano. He then left it on the counter without announcing it and went over to the register to take care of someone else. Im really DONE NOW. (Should you need to know who he is ... he's the ""English major"" he announced that several times. His attitude sucks too.",1.0 star rating

"This charming cafe served up much more than an amazing matcha latte and delectable piece of avocado burrata toast on the morning we visited. Warm and friendly smiles from the two sweetest gentlemen at the counter welcomed us. Packed almost to capacity, I thought for a second about taking my food to-go, but decided to enjoy it here instead. We were lucky to find the last couple of seats in this super cozy spot, and by the time our food was ready a line had formed out the door.The avocado and burrata toast was absolutely delicious! My eyes must have grown to the size of golf balls when I first laid them on it. Fresh is best and fresh it was, the handful of arugula with the creamy burrata on the very thick toast had me savoring every bite.There were so many other great looking and smelling brunch items, coffees and pastries I gazed at as they passed over the counter. Pricey? A bit, but the quality of the what's served isn't lacking. This was my first visit and I've already thought of an excuse to make my way over again!",5.0 star rating
"I hesitated to write this review because I don't want this place to get over-run but this place is seriously a gem. I also am so surprised that I never knew about this place and I used to live three blocks away--I guess it really flies under the radar! I am a huge fan of Andytown and their Snowy Plover so knowing that I didn't need to drive all the way to the Outer Sunset to get my caffeine fix was an amazing realization.The cafe is located in the residential area in Castro/Noe...you know the part where you have to climb the giant hill to get there and you wonder if your engine will actually make the crest at the top of the hill. What's nice about that is that there isn't as much foot traffic so it has a much quieter, chiller vibe. On a Saturday afternoon, there were actually some available tables--a crazy thought in San Francisco!They offer a variety of coffee options, including the famous Snowy Plover, and also some cool matcha options. The Snowy Plover mixes espresso, sparkling water, brown sugar syrup, and a generous dollop of salted homemade whipped cream. The result is perfectly balanced and refreshing coffee float. It's not overly sweetened like a lot of other coffee drinks so if you're a true coffee lover, don't worry it won't overpower the espresso itself. They also have several food options including Andytown's delicious scones (served with fennel honey whipped butter!) and also some more cafe-like options like avocado toast, etc. It also seems to double as a mini-market as there was a generous refrigerated section and also various goods being sold in a cute bookshelf (random items from Haribo gummy bears to handcrafted pottery--the theme was very unclear to me).My one qualm: wish they opened until 5 or 6 PM...although, they did recently extend their hours to 4 PM daily.",5.0 star rating
"A wonderful local cafe.  Coffee is great, service is friendly, and it is really nice to be a bit off of 24th Street.  I'm always able to get a space to sit and they welcome people working there.  Prices are high, but alas, we live in San Francisco.",5.0 star rating

"Mom and I stopped by for a quick morning pick-me-up, and were pleasantly surprised to find such a cute cafe in the residential area of Castro!  It was also much larger than expected, with a decent amount of seating space (albeit at a communal table) and a bathroom for customers. In addition to the usual espresso drinks and teas, they also have an assortment of matcha specials. Since it was particularly hot the day we visited, mom and I both got iced drinks (even though we have a rule about not drinking anything iced before 12PM). I got the matcha with tonic - which was good until all the ice melted and it turned into soupy green gunk. My mom got the iced chai which she really enjoyed.They have a brunch menu that I didn't fully explore, as well as some packaged meals (including sushi) in their refrigerated display.",4.0 star rating
"A standout corner coffee and bakery shop nestled in Noe Valley. I spent the weekend visiting the bff and we walked with her dog to this gem of a place. The Matcha Latte was perfect and the Currant Scone w/ fennel butter was so satisfying on that cold day. The lady who helped us was lovely and sweet. She even went outside to give water and give hugs and pets to our dog. The shop is a modern meets industrial design. Bathroom was clean and had cool decor. This shop also carries bottled drinks like kombucha, ice cream, and healthy food/snacks. Perfect place to catch up with friends over a nice cup of joe, do some work (I did see a girl with a whole laptop on a stand setup), or relax with a good book.",5.0 star rating
"Steven made my day. I'm in town for business the morning before I had gotten some items and suffered a bit of sticker shock at the $15 for three items I got (latte, croissant, and a cold brew) but... it's San Francisco. I've been spoiled with LA prices. The coffee and croissant were Delish. Next day I had found out that my mother was in the ER and was despondent and had to go to my client. I went in for coffee and a croissant again. Steven asked me how I was... and while I love a social contract... I didn't have it in me. ""I'm pretty shitty actually...."" was my response. He cracked a pun or two about my star-covered dress and he was very sweet. When the latte was done I gave him my card. He pushed it back gently and said ""it's on me... I hope things get better.""Thank you for seeing someone in pain and helping the little way you could for them. You made me a customer whenever I'm back in SF. For sure. And the coffee and croissant? Totally delicious.",5.0 star rating
"Finally got around to really trying out this local coffee shop and it was incredible. I've been for coffee a few times and it is incredible! They also carry oat milk which I appreciate a lot. I tried their avocado toast this weekend and was definitely impressed. The girl preparing them was meticulous and led to a perfectly portioned out, absolutely delicious toast. I added burrata on mine (11/10 would recommend) and my fiance got the hard-boiled egg on his. Both were fantastic. The side salad was also delicious.Perfect place for a quick brunch and amazing coffee.",5.0 star rating

We had a nice chat about how they just opened up and discussed his cool cork bench. We ended up buying a great sourdough loaf they carry from a local bakery. The corn muffin was also excellent. I believe they made the corn muffin in house. The macarons they carry were some of the most interesting flavors I've seen. They were delicious and were 6 for $15.They sell Andytown coffee.

"Neighbor's Corner is one of those cafes you always look for but never find. The Fata Morgana of cafes. Only this time it's real. An oasis in a quiet neighborhood - it seems it's always sunny when you walk in to Neighbor. Look outside the clean windows and you'll find palm trees and succulents, neighborhood people walking their dogs and even children (in SF!!). The clientele is great - at any given day you may find a young woman writing her thesis, the Y-Combinator founder working on her pitch for demo day, and a senior citizen finishing that 800 page novel. The staff. Oh the staff. All models of the perfect cafe personel - not too hipster, always friendly and approachable. They even have outlets and good WiFi but don't tell any of the techies. 5 stars whether you are visiting or native. Thank you Neighbor's Corner!",5.0 star rating

"I moved into this area recently and realized I need quarters to do laundry with the machines downstairs. I entered this coffee shop with the intention of getting quarters and ended up with  chai latte just to purchase something. I LOVE IT! I really enjoy spicy chais where you can taste the ingredients and this one exceeded expectations! It's made with almond milk but it tastes creamy and is the perfect amount of sweet. I'm currently enjoying it as I'm writing this review haha.I can't believe I've been avoiding this place... it seemed a bit expensive, which being in Noe Valley, it definitely is, but I'm satisfied and will be back for sure. Especially because i'm just a ten second walk away! Also, I didn't expect them to have food, but they have a small selection of sushi, sandwiches, and even local ice cream! There are enough seats for studying or doing work and the lady behind the counter was really nice! I told her about my need for quarters and she was so quick to help. I even cleaned out all the quarters in the register but she said not to worry, that she had more in the back. She didn't need to be so friendly and she was! Thanks girl :)",5.0 star rating
Really cute but overpriced and few options. I came in on a Sunday for breakfast and they were already out of food options by 10am. I got the ham toast and they piled so much ham on top it was hard to eat (needed a sharper knife). Overly fancy in my opinion.,3.0 star rating
"Neighbor's Corner is the corner coffee shop that we all wish we had. I went there for breakfast several times recently and enjoyed a variety of beverages. Like Andytown, they have both the snowy plover and matcha plover, which are well-executed. The drip coffee comes with free refills, a pleasant surprise to a non-morning person. I tried the avocado toast, which comes with a huge slice of bread, as well as some deliciously spicy avocado. The egg was hardboiled, which is unusual but not bad. The scones with the seasoned butter are fantastic and definitely worth trying. To be honest, I was sad that I didn't have time to try all of the baked goods because they all looked amazing.There's also a refrigerator with various prepared food from recognisable SF restaurants, as well as some jams, coffee beans, etc. for sale.The service here deserves a special callout. They are the friendliest group of people that you could possibly find. They know all of the people who come in, as well as their associated pets.

"(Sorry, this review is a little late)The first time I came here was with a close friend of mine. We both went through a hard time and one thing we mainly have in common is our profound love for coffee. She has been here before and she wanted to take me. It's been a hobby for us to try coffee shops in our area.So, we went and we were able to find a seat easily and I treated her because it was her birthday. She ordered the avocado and egg toast with the Whopper Latte and I got the PBJ toast with the Crème Brulee Latte. OMG. It was honestly so cool seeing the barista whip out a machine and torch my drink. And it was even more fun trying to break the top of my drink. Her whopper latte was good and I really enjoyed the sweetness. Mind you, I was surprised they actually dropped a few whopper candies in the drink. It was pretty cool.The food was delicious. I'm a fiend for anything PBJ and the jam tasted so fresh. I was debating about also getting the avocado toast but they added red flakes.. and anything red reminds me of spicy. Your girl doesn't do spicy, as much as possible. But my dear friend said it was really good. She offered me some but I honestly chickened out.I really want to come back, but I've yet to go back to the city. Hopefully soon and I will definitely stop by here again.",5.0 star rating
"Coffee, tea & food selection: 5/5Customer service: 5/5Air quality: EMERGENCY (I bet this was one time only lol You'll be fine.)Found this coffee shop on Yelp and went there to try a creme brulee latte. The latte was good! The burnt part is very sweet, but latte isn't that sweet. So it was a great combination.BUT here it comes...After spending 1hr there, the air inside this shop became really stinky. I know, a mid-age guy who came with another guy farted behind me when he left his table to get a cup of water. I knew it because he realized it stinks really bad and didn't go back to his table. He went outside for 5 min, came back inside, and went straight to the bathroom. (well, I feel bad for him and his health.)While he's outside, people realized something really stinks...Honestly I thought he accidentally pooped in his pants. It was that bad...People started to leave, and two workers went outside to check if the smell comes from outside. Then seems like it was from the inside. So a female employee sprayed air refresher at the entrance, and male employee opened the big window near the ceiling to get fresh air. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. But I couldn't endure with the smell, and I ended up leaving. I wanted to stay longer to read books and write my journal, but unfortunately I couldn't. (Certainly got something to write though.)I'd love to go back there to try another special coffees, great selection of teas, and foods....but also I'm scared of the smell lol",4.0 star rating
"A friend and I were browsing for a study spot and luckily stumbled upon Rise & Grind! For a Tuesday afternoon, it was pretty crowded but we were lucky enough to snag a table next to an outlet. I ended up ordering a biscoff cookie butter latte and a breakfast sandwich! It was pretty hard narrowing it down to these too because there were so many great options. The cookie butter latte was tasty and not overly sweet but I wish it had a bit more cookie flavor to it. The sandwich was delicious, messy, and very filling. I kind of wish this was served on a plate rather than wrapped in foil since we ordered for here but it honestly wasn't too big of an issue. My study experience was good here and while it was a bit loud, it's nothing a little music can't drown out. The wifi was down for a moment but was pretty fast otherwise.",4.0 star rating

We were lucky enough to find seating for us inside, and tried one of each flavor of the waffles: matcha, Belgian and ube. Among us we tried the spicy mocha, salted caramel, and creme brûlée coffees. The spicy mocha was too spicy, the creme brûlée was pretty good as was salted caramel. I regret not trying the cookie butter latte! As far as the waffles go, the Ube was my favorite then regular Belgian and matcha last. They were all good, but matcha was a little too strong and the other two were better balanced for my preference.",4.0 star rating
"I feel like this is the epitome of SF casual/cool that the person from LA in me that envys and wants desperately for myself. I walked in around 8am Monday morning before my flight, even then there were other people so it wasn't dead, all working away on their laptops with a cup of joe. I was lucky to get a seat where I could tuck away my suitcase and ordered the Black Sesame (!!) latte and the frittata sandwich. If I'm spending $$ on getting food I'd rather do it locally on the good stuff than the airport. I love all things black sesame and this didn't disappoint, it had that black sesame derived savoriness (?) that I only have a word for in Korean (gosohae). There was a ton of it ground up and in the latte but it does settle so make sure to stir it up! The sandwich was really good, level of cooked/toasted was perfect. The chips were OK, tasted like ruffles or something.It was the perfect setting for a casual, leisurely but also get s**t done environment with great food and coffee, would highly recommend and will stop by again in the future.",5.0 star rating
"Live reviews are the best.Rise and Grind is indeed appropriately named. Saturday afternoon close to Christmas and there are still young professional cats with their noise cancelling headphones going ham on their company laptops. Corporate culture all about that Grind.Which is a shame because this place got something like 67 different types of lattes on their menu. I guess the Salted Caramel and the Vanilla ones are a given in San Francisco at this point, but these guys also have a Creme Brûlée Latte, a Whopper Latte (candy, not the burger i assume), and some 'exclusive' ones like the Biscoff Cookie Latte. Wild. Imagine coming here not grinding and enjoying some of these sweet creations with bae or something.But my bae is at the dentist next door and i'm out here drinking The Richmond Chill. It's their take on the traditional vietnamese iced coffee. Two espresso shots with condensed milk, served chill with the milk of my choice. It's hovering on the sweet side and definitely a bit creamy. My dentist would not approve.It's uncomfortably quiet in here. They got some soft David Archiletta playing in here, mixed in with the casual chatter from the two Baristas. Basically a perfect place for studying. I see a few outlets here and there for your laptop. There's also those bar/bench seating by the window if you decide to bring your ipad. Whenever i see an ipad outside of home i always think of that 'what's a computer?' commercial.The two baristas are very nice. They're like librarians when they walk the avocado toasts to your table. Super quiet and with minimum disturbance. They know their crowd.I feel a bit it of place with my casual demeanor and my Saturday vibes. I wouldn't choose this place to catch up with a friend or to reread The Prisoner of Azkaban. It'll be perfect if i had weekend work or if i had a side hustle in life to tend to. Perhaps that's what i need. I'm growing older at a scary and an alarming rate and my bank account is not keeping pace. Maybe it's about time i stop using Saturday's to rise and shine and instead using them to Rise and Grind.But until that moment i guess i'll SYOY!",4.0 star rating
"What a cute find! I was looking for somewhere to study in the area to catch up on some work before a picnic in the park. It's pretty small but there's a lot of light and spacious tables.As the biggest PB fan, I was eager to try the peanut butter latte. It's mostly PB rather than coffee, so something of a dessert. I think it was kinda overwhelming but worth trying! Onto other great things about this place! I could always find a table although there's a university in the area. There are also outlets and good WiFi (huge win!). Plus, a bathroom for the customers. I've needed up coming to Rise & Grind a couple more times to do work. Would recommend to everyone!",5.0 star rating
A lovely place with lovely people who make great beverages. I'm in no means a coffee snob & I wasn't a regular coffee drinker until falling in love with the Richmond Chill!  And yes it's great that they offer free WiFi but if you've been there since the AM feel free to order something else in the afternoon. They do have lots of variety after all (including a beloved avocado toast).,5.0 star rating
Came here for the first time yesterday and fell in love with it! Got the vanilla latte and it was the perfect amount of sweetness. I shared my cup but immediately wished I got my own. Seems a little loud to be a study spot but there are people who do it. Other than that it seems to be a place for people to catch up.,5.0 star rating
"Shop: Super cute! There are seatings but you may have to share the tables with others. There are a couple spots for electric outlets, which is a plus! Bathroom: Get a code from the cashier. It's clean! Staff: Super nice and friendly. The orders were made pretty quickly as well. Avocado toast: The best one I've ever had. The avocado is mushed, well seasoned, and nicely spread. The toast was crunchy on the sides and soft on the inside. ($9ish)Breakfast something Sandwich: The aioli sauce on it gave the sandwich a great taste. Everything was just a perfect combination with the buns, the cheese, the egg and the bacon. ($7ish)Salted caramel latte: Tasted amazing. ($4-$5)Cold brew: They didn't cold brew it right then and there. It was in a jug which was in the fridge. However, it actually still tasted great. ($4-$5)WiFi password can be requested. I would totally come back. This is my new favorite coffee shop to get work done and fill my belly!",5.0 star rating
"TL;DR- this review prioritizes the work/study aspect, with everything else being secondary- good wifi and multiple outlets with ebbs and flows of people throughout the day- reasonable drinks and eats; apparently, the avocado toast is to die for- free parking except street cleaning on 1st and 3rd Monday of the month- tip: Golden Gate Park is 50ft away making it an ideal pre/post date spot- RECOMMENDED for work and play2nd time coming here during the beginning and end of the week. For cafes, I like to prioritize it being a good work/study environment with eats/drinks being secondary.Foremost, good wifi and multiple outlets to either get some work done or watch videos. What I personally like about this place is the flow of people throughout the day; the cafe might have only you in it, but a few hours in, and there's a pleasant hum of people talking. They have both eats and drinks that include coffee and tea, or pastries and meals. Coffee and tea are good with prices reasonable. You'll occasionally hear people order the avocado toast, but never having tried it myself, it's next on my to-do list. Lastly, there is free street parking! Feels like a rare thing in San Francisco, but beware of street cleaning day which is the 1st and 3rd Monday of the month. An understated, but appreciated fact, is that it's located right next to Golden Gate Parking making it an ideal date spot before or after a little stroll in the park.

"Cute cafe off the beaten path. Stopped by here for the cold brew which was pretty good. Staff was slow and not friendly.  They seemed more interested in talking with their coworkers and friends not purchasing anything rather than helping customers. No seats were available on the late morning. Seems like it gets a lot of people working from ""home"" on their laptops. They need to find a way to move people every couple hours if they want more business. Only street parking is available...good luck!",3.0 star rating
"Loved my experience at this trendy coffee shop tucked away on this residential block right off Park Presidio.London Fog - this is one of the better Earl Grey lattes that I've had! The milk supports the Early Grey tea very well, the tea still comes through strong. Avocado Toast - Runny, fried egg sits atop of a bed of mashed avocado smeared across a comfy, thick piece of toast. Garnished with red pepper flakes. Yum! Salted Caramel Latte - A solid caramel latte. The latte art was definitely a plus!Matcha Waffles - MMmmatcha! Comes in 4 pieces, toasted and drizzled over by a matcha/condensed milk syrup. The edges were a little overdone but I loved this nonetheless! Especially the sauce.Their menu definitely stands out, at least this is the first time I have ever seen Whopper Latte on a menu. Whether you are in a hurry and want to call in your order for a quick pick up or take your time sitting in to enjoy your matcha waffle and latte art, this is the place.",4.0 star rating
"Pizza is served after 6!!!!!!!!!For those who traveled 300 plus miles like me to try their pizza, GO AFTER 6 pm!!!Now after trying the coffee. I was sold. It was great, smooth and not so acidic! Enough power to get you through your next hurdle! I cant stress enough about not being able to try the pizza. I get it. Its made at a certain time so thats when you get it. I should have done my research a little more in depth vs ""awe yeah good pizza!"" total FAIL.Bread on the other hand is great. I cant remember the list of names they had but thats nicely baked, almost burnt. We picked up some cheese and made sure this bread is treated with upmost respect! Dang it was good.I love a good dark rye, sourdough, anything thats baked with love.Lots of seating, high ceiling, white walls, proper greetings. Its all melodious. Toasts with different jams and hummus, maybe some feta, even avocado. I only glanced at the toasts for a second. They serve it all for each distinguished palates from what I saw.

"The layout is so cute and on trend. It's no surprise it was rated on SF's most Instagram worthy spots. But.If you are like me, you eat with your mouth as much as your eyes. The coffee falls flat and the toast has been pretty disappointing. Adding giant pieces of rock salt to a peanut butter and jelly toast doesn't elevate it. Avocado toast was ok. They also will not slice the bread for you. So, I prefer walking down to Bi-Rite for a loaf.",2.0 star rating
"My friend recommended me to stop by here as it was one of her favorite coffee shops. The interior resembles being inside of a working Mill (I've never been in a mill but I've seen a lot of movies. ha!) The place was very vibrant, with many people just working, socializing and simply reading. The Mill has a very open environment and feel, where it does make it seem like you're in bakery factory. I ordered the macchiato as I wanted to try something different than a latte. The macchiato was super dark and had a strong roast aroma. I can see why some people might not like this, but I really enjoyed sipping on this. Parking here kind of sucks as you're in the heart of NOPA. I would strongly suggest Uber or public transportation.",4.0 star rating
"Dang I can't stop thinking about their molasses brown bread. So chewy, so tender, slightly dense but moist -- I could sink into this everyday. It was THE BEST TOAST I've ever had. This means a lot coming from a girl who wrote stories about a talking toast named EatMe in middle school. Now I just write yelp reviews ft real toast. Anywhoo--Almond butter + molasses brown bread (!!)= simple, pure, perfection. The brown bread goes real well with the nutty almond butter. Their original pairing was with everything bread, but I'm so glad I got to try the brown bread. Thank you The Mill for being cool and flexible.Cream cheese + pesto + rye = combination flavor heaven. They are all a good match. The pesto has a strong flavor in the best way while the sea salt brings it out and the cream cheese mellows it. And the bread. Easily the best rye I've had. Not dense or dry, but chewy. The menu is simple but innovative with great combinations. Latte was great too. Food came out fast. And quite reasonable, no $12 avocado toast nonsense. Also this place is bright with a nicely designed interior. The neighborhood is walkable and nice and we found parking easy friday morning. And the brown bread(!!) my gosh.",5.0 star rating
"I finally tried the Mill's pizza today!!...after two years of hearing my good friend talk so highly about it. The fact that this place is always full of people on their laptops even though there's no wifi says how ~worth it~ this place is as a place to work (and just be and eat at).I've had a latte here and the almond butter toast. both so good.and most recently, I got two slices of the Mill Pizza of the Week Broccoli + Chili Flakes. ALso SOO good, fresh, and not pretentious.We came on a Sunday right at 6pm and there was already a line! About 10 minutes later we got to order. I got two slices and I'm SOO glad I did. The pizza was so fresh and the ingredient profile surprisingly worked really well.The only thing I'd caveat with is that it's pretty busy. We were lucky to get a spot outside.",5.0 star rating
"Came here for avocado toast, but they didn't have it on the menu because it's ""seasonal"". Almost turned away, but it was a trek to get here so we decided to stay for another option. 5 stars for the rye bread. Seriously, this is the best rye bread I've ever had in my life. Ordered the cream cheese with basil toast and honestly the spread was whatever, but the freakin' bread was TO DIE FOR. Forget avocados and forget cream cheese, throw anything on top of this bread and it will be AMAZING! Arrived at 10:40am and the line was out the door and no seats were available. Really, really hard to grab seats so keep your eyes peeled. Not a place I'd typically find myself, but definitely will be back for more rye bread toast :D",5.0 star rating
"3.25/5Needed a study spot and decided to give this place a try. Nice huge cafe with a few small individual tables and a larger communal table. For a Friday this place was pretty busy though I was able to grab a seat without any issue since people do come and go. It's not a great place for long-term work. Even though there's quite a few people with their laptops out, this place does not have wifi or outlets which is a shame cause I would be happy to just sit and eat toast while I work all day. It has a nice open layout and lots of natural light. Location is a bit far from BART so not the most convenient to get to. Parking is mostly street and can get busy. Service here is so friendly and welcoming.I got the #1 which was dark mountain rye bread from Josey Bakery with a smear of cream cheese, pesto, pine nuts, salt, and pepper. The bread quality is excellent. A thick hefty piece with a hearty nutty texture and a bit of sourness from the rye. Nice tang from the cream cheese and a very earthy herby pesto. Generous amount of pepper and salt brings out all the favors. Really wish the pine nuts were toasted. Is it worth $7 though? Not really. I'd rather go to Josey Bakery for a loaf and make this myself.Overall, The Mill is a great place to do some quick work. The service is friendly and the quality of the items they serve is good but honestly a bit overpriced especially when I can't stay around to do work.",3.0 star rating
"This place is PACKED on the weekends up until around 5:30pm when people start heading back for dinner plans. Around 6:30pm, there's a new influx of people coming for the 6-9pm pizza ($3/slice). That said, the best time to come to snag indoor seating is between 5:30-6:15pm. My friend and I ordered the garlic knots (they serve them between 5-6pm) and the pizza (served 6-9p). Garlic knots: 4/5 more on the dense bread-y side. I would have liked more garlic flavor. $3 each. Pizza: 4/5 we ordered their special of the day- broccoli. The crust was thin and and maintained its crisp. It was good for its price, $3/slice.Atmosphere and service were good. Would come back for the vibeszz",4.0 star rating
"Ugh, I ordered the dark mountain rye with cream cheese, pesto, salt, pepper, and pine nuts for $7. I didn't know what it would look like, but I was hoping it would be the nice, thick toast that everyone else seemed to be eating. It wasn't. It was a pretty thin slice - probably because it's rye bread. I probably should have went with a different combo and I probably should not be spending $7 for a tiny piece of toast with cream cheese.We also got a few pastries from the display. They seemed kinda meh, kinda familiar. When I asked if they made it or if it was shipped in, I believe the cashier told me it was from Neighbor Bakehouse. Ah I see. They rejected my request to heat up the $5 pastries lol. Good place to experience an overwhelming feeling of SF arrogance from the staff and customers. The staff will outwardly smile, but they somehow project obnoxiousness also. It's eerie.",3.0 star rating
"It was on my list to stop by when visiting San Francisco. Finally got a chance to visit last week. Loved it the moment I walked in. The smell of fresh baked bread gets you hungrier. They have variety of breads for sale and also delicious toasts with different toppings. Few baked goods such as danishes and croissants and a great  coffee bar. The cappuccino was delicious. We ordered few toasts just to try it out, all delicious. We bought zaatar bread to go and a jar of raspberry jam. Both were amazing. The bread lasted few days and stayed very fresh. Overall great quality baked goods guaranteed.Try it.",5.0 star rating
"Came to this hipster spot at the suggestion of a friend who lives in the neighborhood. Can a cafe that sells different kinds of toasts be anything but trendy AF? I literally saw someone wearing overalls AND a beanie, like one wasn't sufficient.I love that you can see them making the bread and the orders in the back. I went ham and got two toasts: pesto and almond butter. The pesto was the besto.

"I eat pizza 4 out of 7 days, just a slice. Did I say I like pizza? I find it to be the perfect snack - carbs, proteins, vitamins.So whenever Arizmendi in the Mission has a day off (Tuesdays) or they have unnatural toppings (I am looking at you comice pears or potato or something ungodly that you simply do not put on pizza without giving an Italiano grandmother a mini heart attack), I head over to The Mill.This is a hipster place that plays hipster music and is frequented by hipsters who like hipster beer and hipster food at hipster prices. To be fair, the food, craft beer, coffee and bread (Josey Baker bread) are great.Every evening from 6-9 (except first Monday of every month) they serve you pizza by the slice. One seasonal veggie and another classic cheese slice. It's a pretty big slice for $3.50 (plus taxes) and you can tell it has high quality ingredients. The magic is in the dough, which is baked perfectly, light, airy, crisp and salty (think tiny chunks of salt that hit your palette as you bite the crust). I usually get it to go, and I reheat it at 450 until the cheese starts to boil a wee bit. And voila, it's ready to be gone in 60 seconds. If you are craving a slice, without breaking the bank or your daily calorie budget, this is the place to be in the evening. You can usually find a spot on weekday evenings, and get your slice within 3 minutes.The toppings can be from onion and mushroom to 4 cheese (quattro formaggi) to something ungodly such as pineapple and jalapeño (sounds better than it tastes). Try this pizza for the dough. Also it's not gooey or overflowing with oil. So you won't feel tres guilty. If you want to balance it out, they also have a salad (7 bucks I think) that can make you justify that delicious slice.",4.0 star rating
"Came here on a Sunday morning with a friend, and there was a line in the store. However, we were able to find a seat. I got the fruit jam toast and he got the nutella. The toast itself was a pretty good size and reasonably thick. The toppings were fine, albeit a bit plain for the price. There also was sea salt added to both of ours, which is nice in theory, but they might have overdone it as it was a bit too salty and actually hurt my mouth to eat it. I would give this place a 3.5 if I could. Coffee was average. The loaves of bread for sale looked good, and I heard the pizza is amazing. I would come back for the more savory toasts or the pizza, but I'm not in a rush to come back for the sweets toasts.",3.0 star rating
"The bread, coffee and pizza at the mill are great, and the service friendly, but the prices are a bit high. I usually buy a loaf of the bread on the weekends to have on hand during the week.I used to buy it at bi rite next door while picking up other groceries but ecently it hasn't been available there so I have to come to the mill which I don't love because you have to wait 10 minutes to buy a loaf of bread, which is frustrating when not ordering a drink or toast etc. I wish there was a way for neighborhood folks to quickly buy a loaf of bread.",4.0 star rating
"When I first moved to sf I would go to The Mill all the time for toast in the morning, but eventually I got tired of waiting in line. BUT for the past year   I have been getting a whole veggie pie to go and it is SOOO good! There were a couple of times last month that the dough seemed a little thin but still delish. My favorite so far have been the delicata squash with pesto and the brussels sprouts but sadly I only got to have each once, unlike many others that they rotate more often. I'm always so excited to try a new topping, I literally check the website a couple times a week.

"The most SF place I have visited and if you're coming here, don't expect it to be cheap for what you're getting.  The toasts are delicious and done very well, but brace yourself for the prices (they range from around $4-7 for a single slice).  I came here late morning on a weekday and most of the tables were occupied with people doing work, which was crazy to me because there isn't any free wifi in the building.  Still, there wasn't a line when I got there and I received my food within 5 minutes.  If you're looking for suggestions, you can't go wrong with the seasonal fruit jam.  I ordered it without even asking what fruit it was, and it turned out to be apricot, which I usually don't go for, but I'd definitely order it again.  There was a pesto ricotta toast that sounded tasty, but it was on the more expensive side and from what I saw, it didn't look like it had much pesto at all, so I'm not sure I would go for that (I'm sure it's good, though).Could you make your own version of their toasts for much, much cheaper? Yes.  Are you getting quality food and is it worth the price?  Yes.  I personally won't come here that often for food, but I still think it's really good and worth it every once in a while.  Plus, I LOVE the fact that even though they're a toast place, they don't have avocado toast on their menu.",4.0 star rating
"Personally, I am a huge fan of coffee. Andytown offers a unique twist to their drinks. There's something about espresso and Pellegrino that's soooo right! They make their own whipped cream. My favorite is their snowy plover (they may have renamed it). It's basically espresso with Pellegrino topped off with their homemade whipped cream. make sure you mix it all up before drinking. Probably my favorite caffeinated drink ever. It's great that Andytown is so eco friendly. Their cups are compostable and they only use paper straws. Of course, you can take it to the next level and purchase one of their reusable metal straws for less than the price of a cup of coffee. The metal straw also comes with a little brush for cleaning the inside. If you like coffee, definitely checkout Andytown.",5.0 star rating

The irony though was that I ordered the $2.25 Fresh Ginger Tea here (photo: bit.ly/2ViqC0q). I just had coffee over at the Beachside on Judah and didn't want to get hyper-caffeinated.It was cold that morning, and protrusions on my body were starting to ice over if you know what I mean. It was soothing with a slight spikiness. Not my protrusions, the tea.

"Andytown Coffee Roasters (San Francisco, CA)A barista in Utah recommended Andytown Coffee Roasters to me.  She noticed that I threw in a lot of heavy cream and whipped cream topping in my coffee and stated that I would love Andytown's Plover. I finally get here, and I didn't even get any of their Plovers.  But my wife did, and she loved the Matcha Plover.  I had a sip and agree that their Plover is the way to go. Me, on the other hand, kept it boring and had their wind & sea blend drip coffee with a ton of their delicious heavy cream.  I admit it, the Plover that my wife had was awesome.  But I can't deny it, my coffee was delicious too and worth another trip back.  Overall, I highly recommend Andytown Coffee Roasters. Tip #1:  Limited parking in front.  Tip #2:  Long line, but fast-paced.  They don't mess around here. Tip #3:  Limited seating inside.  Tip #4:  Get one of their Plovers.",5.0 star rating
"The snowy plover is what caught my eye. I was searching through yelp for a good coffee spot in the area and came accross Andytown. I love coffee and anything with caffeine so I had to try their unique drink. I got here around 945am on a Saturday and there was line out the door already. I had my eye on the original snowy plover already, by reading reviews on it. The drink was definitely different....they make it with espresso, soda water, and a scoop of their home made cream. I loved it! It could be a little bit stonger in my opinion. I also got the blood orange scone which was tasty. They have a limited seating area inside and a few tables outside. I definitely would come back to try the matcha plover and other items if ever I am back in SFO.",4.0 star rating
There is something special about snowy plover which always draws me back to Andytown! It is so addicting!! I have tried different flavors and the original is my all time favorite :) There are three Andy locations in the Sunset and I discover the one on Lawton makes the most quality cream than the other two locations. Sometimes the other two locations on Taravel don't even fill me with a full cup. All of these places are relatively small so it's not the best place to hang out and chill with friends.  There is really nothing to complain about their drinks and I love their latte so much as well,5.0 star rating
"Wow, talk about going in on a place for it's lack of space. All the negative reviews mainly mention that. While I do agree that this shop is rather cramped, I will not allow it to be to its detriment. Nope, not on my account. My advice, take a good shop for what it is.I had a memorable experience at Andytown and that was largely due in part to the friendliness of the staff. Their welcome was warm and surely came with smiles. What a good way to have woken up that morning. Aside from an excellent cup of drip I enjoyed, the breakfast sandwich that I accompanied it with made my morning start even better. Despite its shortcomings in size, I feel that is what made the experience. It means having to sit closely by complete strangers, elbows likely touching, or being on the lookout for the next open space if you haven't found a place yet. It has a charm to it, maybe an inconvenient one if that paradox is acceptable. It's good for a short stop, so take it at that. I was smitten with my visit to Andytown. So much so that I referred to it as my favorite coffee stop during my weekend in San Fran when talking to friends. Even brought myself a little bag of joy, in the form of their Ethiopian single origin beans.",5.0 star rating

"I'm not a coffee drinker, but so many people recommended Andytown to me that I finally decided to give it a try. I was super thrilled to see that Andytown offers 2 non-coffee variations of their popular snowy plover drinks. I went with the matcha and loved it! I don't typically enjoy sparkling water, but this drink was refreshing and perfect for making the most of a rare sunny day while exploring the neighborhood. Also, the whipped cream is freakin' amazing. This drink gets a little messy--prepare to have a whipped cream mustache--but it's so worth it. Tiny space, so plan to take your drink to go.",5.0 star rating

It's like a matcha soda and that whipped cream was fabulous! They also have a seasonal plover which was blueberry yesterday. I will definitely be dreaming of this drink until we return.",5.0 star rating
"If you like really strong coffee, like REALLY strong, Andytown is the place to go. Not really a good place to sit and get work done. There's one ""big"" (seats about 4-5 people) table inside and 1-2 tables inside that seat up to 2 people. Theres a few tables outside but no shade it'll either be too bright to sit out or too windy/cold. Anyways, I came with a group of 12 people and we literally took half the chairs in the outside seating area. My fiance got the iced coffee which was REALLY strong. I think I could've added a full cup of water and it could still be strong. They also have paper straws (bring your own straws) for the cold drinks, which ended up getting soggy after like 5 minutes of drinking your coffee. It's in a quiet neighborhood (At least it was on Sunday around 2pm) so there was lots of parking available.",4.0 star rating
"I got the Snowy Plover, which is what everyone seems to rave about for this place and what was the Instagram shot for the day. Unfortunately, while it looked pretty, I thought it was disgusting!You're basically drinking an espresso soda, with sweetener in it, and some whip cream on top. The whole thing was disgusting, and tasted really off, especially the sweetener that comes with the espresso soda. It was just an unusual and unpleasant sensation.The best part of the drink though was the whipped cream, that was amazing and tasted really good. If I could do it over I'd just ask for an espresso shot with the whipped cream, and I would have loved it a lot.Even when mixing the whipped cream in, it only made the drink marginally better, and it wasn't enough to carry the otherwise crappy drink.",2.0 star rating
Matcha lattes here are bomb! They're always busy so if you're in a rush come earlier. I only tried their snowy plover once and it wasn't what I expected in a good way.

Last and most important--staff was fantastic, welcoming, kind, knowledgeable, cool.",5.0 star rating
"It's always cold in the Sunset, but never too cold for Snowy Plovers!! I also don't usually start off my day with iced coffee (I have this unspoken rule about not drinking anything cold before noon..), but I was happy to make an exception today! :)I've always been a fan of espresso with tonic, so this drink was definitely on my radar, and I'm so glad I tried it. The little bit of brown sugar syrup was just sweet enough to cut the bitterness of the espresso but not so much that I couldn't enjoy the strong aroma of the Andytown roast. The homemade whipped cream was also really, really good! I'm not even usually a fan of whipped cream, and typically order my drinks without it, but I loved the texture of theirs! I think I will be requesting it in all of my future drinks, even if it isn't included. :9I had the cheddar bacon scone for breakfast, which was quite tasty, but pricey for what it was. I think the next time I visit, it will just be for the coffee. I'm excited to bring my coffee-loving friends here though!In terms of the cafe itself, it is pretty tiny with one larger communal table and a few counter seats. I'm not sure if they have outdoor seating year round, but they did today, which is where I sat to enjoy my breakfast. Otherwise, this cafe is probably better as a grab-to-go type of place than somewhere to sit and do work.",5.0 star rating
"Oh no, they stop serving bread at 3pm! Despite this and the fact that the shop is tiny with little seating, the coffee wins me over.I got a latte with almond milk. It was the best latte I've ever had. Such a rich, nutty flavor.Boyfriend got the snowy blower and was moderately happy. I think because it was a cold, rainy day the latte was especially delicious. I could see the snowy blower being especially delicious during summer.The other pastries didn't seem appealing to me so I was pretty bummed that they stopped serving bread. Hopefully next time I'll get to try it!Like I mentioned approx less than 15 seats inside, about 10 outside, my estimates are generous. Bathroom looked really clean.",5.0 star rating
What they're famous for: The Snowy Plover. It is quite good. Espresso+Sparkling Water+Homemade Whip Cream=WAHBAHM SHAZAM BOOM BAAM SHATTER CRASH WOW!I could imagine it being ideal on a hot day. The place itself gets pretty crowded. I had to squeeze next to a neighbor (leave room for Jesus). Their wi-fi is pretty solid.Note: There's a lot of free parking around since Andy's is located in the middle of a residential area.,5.0 star rating
Mind blown from the snowy plover. Also tried my friend's matcha plover and loved that as well. This place is lit!Kudos to Andytown for differentiating themselves in the sea of coffee shops in the world by creating this clever and memorable drink. Just sad they don't have any shops in my hometown.,5.0 star rating
"This hip little coffee shop in the outer sunset is exactly what you'd think it would be: cool, clean and nicely hipster. They boast a small menu of breakfast pastries, toast and sandwiches but, the coffee is the star. The cold brew was punchy and delicious. Served in a pint glass with ice was a great way to be able and experience all it's aromas. The toast I ordered beside it was reminiscent of Irish soda bread as it was dense and slightly crumbly. The butter was also quite good but, it lacked salt. Drop some salt crystals on that butter and you've got a winner. It's a great place to work as the outside seating is anything but distracting and the neighborhood people watching is legit. I love it out there...",5.0 star rating
"Was slightly underwhelmed by this place. It's got a lovely neighborhood feel but it's not great for getting work done or relaxing with a book unless you sit outside in your space. It gets super crowded and it's a small shop so it's not the easiest to move around. That said, $3.25 for a small drip is a bit steep, though the $1 refills are a nice option. The drip itself is solid, very smooth when it cools down, but didn't blow me away. The chocolate chips though are pretty dope, and they're perfect snack size.",4.0 star rating

"Cute little coffee shop I visited while being a tourist in NorCal. We were craving something warm on a rainy day and ordered a lavender tea. I'd never come across a tea like this where the pouch was long and skinny as opposed to regular tea bags. The tea was very, very fragrant. I personally wouldn't get it again because I prefer black flavored tea as opposed to what this was, which had essentially close to no color. The ambiance was nice, but congested. I liked the cute little figurines at the cashier's desk.",4.0 star rating
"When you hang out on Yelp too much, you find Snowbird Coffee on Yelp because it's a newer, fun coffee shop and people try it and leave it on Yelp. I have not written a review in like 6 days, but not a complete week. As you know, I tried to write more TripAdvisor reviews. Yelp is for coffee shops like Snowbird! So here, Snowbird, I have a review for you...Snowbird has a basic cafe list, and I looked for a unique drink. I found the Cafe ""Bombon."" I asked the cashier what the Bombon is and he said it's ""2 shots of espresso over condensed milk."" Alright, so I decided to try it. And then I got it eventually after waiting in a busy line. Then, it was handed to me in a small, cardboard espresso cup(well, I wanted it to-go)...and it looked like chocolate milk or mocha. And then I had the Bombon. I had to sip it and then I judged it. It was a mocha-like espresso and I did not feel the texture of condensed milk, but it was a little sweeter I'd say. Hmm...trying very interesting coffee drinks is fun...and a total waste of cash...but it makes my reviews more interesting on Yelp..so here's to the ""Bombon"" at Snowbird!Snowbird has some apparel on sale, and you can hang out at the cafe. It's near 9th and Judah...I got a bagel after and then I found myself at the bookstore(Green Apple)...and this is what you can do at 9th and Irving..and then you can take the N Judah home...Have a nice day!",4.0 star rating
"I think I might have just found my new coffee spot. I ordered an iced brevano... this drink is perfect, exactly what I imagined. I wish it was more than 6 oz bc I tried drinking it slow but sucked it down so fast. Perfect blend of creamy and sweet. I will be back",5.0 star rating
"Each time I run through the Sunset, I make a stop to this awesome location. It was a lucky find through Yelp, and I haven't looked back since my first trip.AMBIANCE gives a hipster vibe, without the disgruntled staff. Quite the opposite, each time I come in I'm greeted by a friendly team member who seems excited to help me figure out what I want. The space is quite large, with space to sit outside, in the front of the cafe, or in the back which provides a nice scene for working.ORDERED Matcha latte with oat milk ($4.75 + $.75 for oat milk = $5.50).DRINK is fantastic each time! This is one of the first spots I tried switching out regular milk with oat milk, and the balance is perfect (and doesn't overwhelm the matcha).OVERALL I give this spot a fit four stars. Definitely recommend coming in and giving their popular drinks a go as well.",4.0 star rating
"Solid neighborhood hang; my go-to in this part of the Sunset. The drinks are all good, if not spectacular. I usually go for the Spainiard, a sweet latte made with condensed milk. It's a bit small and it can be hard to find a place to sit during peak hours. The vibe is on the quieter side, with most patrons hammering away on laptop keyboards or pensively hovering over books. Not a lot of power outlets. I will be back whenever I'm in the area and need to get work done, provided my battery has a full charge.",3.0 star rating
"I'm not often in the Inner Sunset these days, but when I stop by, Snowbird Coffee is now one of my favorite places to visit. This is a charming coffee shop on 9th Avenue, and the wooden furniture and soft lighting makes this a perfect place if you are looking for a workspace or just a cafe to meet up with a friend to chat for a while. I've tried several of their espresso-based drinks and have not been disappointed. Their Americanos are great, but if you have a sweet tooth, they have a few drinks that include condensed milk as one of the ingredients. I've tried their café bombón, which takes a base of condensed milk and adds a double shot of espresso. The bitterness of the espresso balances the milk well, and it makes me nostalgic for those old days studying abroad in Spain (where I'd get a café biberon at the local cafes). Seating is limited, but I've never had a problem finding a table for myself. You should give this place a try!",5.0 star rating
"I have frequented Snowbird more than a handful of times and I am now writing a review because they have OATLY oat milk. After going to other coffee shops, this brand of oat milk is hard to come by! It's so creamy and delicious. Yum!",4.0 star rating
"Was in the area so I decided to try out this cute little coffee shop. Upon walking in, I was greeted by the cashier who explained the menu to us and told us which drinks were most popular. I went with her recommendation of the Spaniard, a Spanish latte with condensed milk. I really enjoyed this drink and found that it had a good amount of sweetness - it was the perfect accompaniment to a little work session. The space is pretty small with single tables as well as a mini bar area so I wouldn't really recommend it for large groups unless you're getting your drinks to go but I will say that there's adequate room to get your work done if you're just planning on using your laptop! It is a bit dim in the back though so it's not the best work space in that sense. Overall my drink was tasty, the price was reasonable and competitive with others, and service was very friendly! I'll definitely be back again to try some of the other specialty drinks.",4.0 star rating
"Snowbird is a chill, casual multi-roaster coffee spot that offers plenty of seating room and decent coffee and baked goods. I swing by on a rainy day and got the Spaniard, which is a Spanish latte meaning it has condensed milk that makes it a little sweeter than your average latte. Sure was tasty, but wish it we're a few degrees hotter than served. Pretty cool spot to hang out at as there's seats in the front and back.",4.0 star rating

"We were waiting for the traffic to die down before we headed home  after a day long visit to the Golden Gate park .  It was too cold for ice cream so we decided to look for a place for a coffee and pastry.  I guess it had been a busy day because they had nothing left in the case or cloches to eat but there were a few seats available so we decided on coffee. My sister in law wandered away while we ordered , I just had coffee , also ordered were a mocha and tea. Considering everyone else in the place already was drinking, it took a long  time to get our order. The mocha was fine nothing special but not bad the tea was well boiled water and my coffee was barely hot , my sister in law soon apeared with delicious doughnuts from somewhere up the street which saved the day . I'll comeback next time in town and try again. The people were nice, the restroom was clean and it was warm inside .",3.0 star rating

"I love grabbing a cup of coffee from here whenever I'm in the Inner Sunset! I usually take my coffee to go as there are never seats available, but it's ok because the interior is dimly lit and sometimes stuffy.

"Discovered this cute coffee shop while walking around the Sunset area! Since this was my first time, I asked for a recommendation and the lady recommended their popular drink- the Spaniard which is their Spanish latte with condensed milk.

Definitely a spot to sit and relax while the scent of fresh coffee lingers in the air.Keep up the good work Snowbird.",5.0 star rating
"Get the Spaniard latte-- one of the best lattes I've ever had, the perfect sweetness, indulgent and not at all sickening. My friend also really enjoyed her chai latte with oat milk. The pastries are mediocre especially compared to arizmendi across the street. I came here on a Saturday afternoon and it was fairly busy but not at all crowded. It's spacious, but the tables are small, and the outlets are few. Overall, a pretty good place to study, read, or catch up with friends.",4.0 star rating
"This small coffee shop is a nice spot for hanging out with friends. There are only a few tables and all of them are pretty tiny, so I wouldn't recommend bringing a laptop to work here. The area I was sitting at did not have any power outlets either.I ordered a macchiato, expecting it to be a normal sized one like what Starbucks serves, but disappointingly found out it's an expresso shot. My fault for not paying close enough attention to the menu as the ounces are listed next to each drink. It was good and it came with some sparkling water, but I think it's overpriced.Street parking was plentiful. There are many 2-hour parking spots a block or two away, and metered spots right outside the shop.",4.0 star rating
"I come here almost everyday for their special coffees. My favorite is the Spaniard, which is a Spanish latte with a splash of condense milk. The coffee is so smooth and silky with the condense milk.

I love this cute little coffee shop.",4.0 star rating
"In love with the look and vibes here at Four Barrel. Big bar for you to order when you walk into the shop. There's a smaller station off to the side and closer to the front for what seemed like pour overs.

Staff is okay, some are more cheer-y then the next, but overall ok. Fast service which is convenient.They offer a short menu of espresso drinks, coffee, and a mini pastry bar. I ordered an iced mocha. Really delicious! Not overly sweet and it included yummy chocolate shavings. Prices are ok, you average sf coffee shop prices. My iced mocha was $5.75 for 12oz. I also tried my friend's chocolate donut and it was so yummy. Would reccomend their pastries!!Overall nice coffee shop with good drinks and food!",4.0 star rating
"THE. BEST. MOCHA. ON. EARTH.We were at an event at the High School down the street, the Greek Orthodox church at 245 Valencia, so we decided to walk the couple of blocks to get a mocha.  She, being conscious, asked for a non-fat mocha. The young barista really took his time to explain their mochas are low on sugar, and the milk come from cows up in Petaluma, and how she would be better off with the fat than with the sugar that inevitably shows up on low-fat drinks.  He really took the time to explain and so we went for it: two regular mochas.Oh my gosh!  It was smooth, velvety, and not sweet at all - not bitter either, just well balanced.The decor is typical SF coffee house, with ample seating, the roastery in the back half of the space ensures great coffee aromas in the air. The only small complaint is the one gender neutral bathroom.  The place is busy, the line gets 4 people deep, I'm a boy and girls notoriously take longer to do their thang.  Two bathrooms would be better.  As I said, it is a small thing, and not enough to penalize.Drink the MOCHA!",5.0 star rating

Four barrel coffee is our go-to in this neighborhood. It has that lovely feel that tells me it is not a chain it's just a down-home coffee bar were you can get great expresso and cappuccino.

They roast their beans fresh in the back so the air is filled with the aroma of coffee. There is a drip coffee station closer to the entryway for those who just want a simple cup of joe.

"Oh man San Francisco has a fierce coffee competition. Trendy coffee shops like Four Barrel Coffee, Blue Bottle, Philz Coffee, Sightglass Coffee, Ritual Coffee Roasters, etc. are all considered a part of the ""Third Wave"" coffee shops (canned coffee like Folgers = first wave & Peet's / Starbucks = second wave). Currently there are two Four Barrel locations in SF and Four Barrel is also in partnership with The Mill (a bakery shop in SF). They offer cupping classes (free - every Saturday & Sunday from 12:30 PM to 1:30 PM), 3-hour espresso + milk preparation classes ($200 per person), and 90-minute better brewing at home classes ($35 per person). I didn't get to try specialty coffees at the ""slow bar"" (pour over style) and I just ordered at the front counter.***Pecan Muffin ($4.50): Cold muffin, but still tasted pretty good (not overly sweet).Latte ($5): It had a pretty balanced steamed milk & espresso ratio. The drink didn't taste too diluted and latte art was nice.***I personally still prefer Philz Coffee because Four Barrel is missing the ""it"" factor, but Four Barrel serves a good cup of coffee.",4.0 star rating
"On a Saturday afternoon around 2pm, Four Barrel was busy but not overly crowded. There was a short line to order, and our espresso drinks seemed to take a good 5-10 minutes. There wasn't room for 3 to sit inside, but we sat outside on the parklet and could people watch (it was a bit chilly though - probably why it was easier to find seats out there). I also finally got to try a pastry here! * Buckwheat Peach Corn donut - 3.5 starsSurprisingly good blend of flavors, but I prefer a little more moistness in my donuts (I'm always a yeasty-donut kind of gal, vs. cake-y donut).Paired this with an iced coffee - good stuff.",4.0 star rating

Very cute unique interior with floral latte to-go cups, whimsical flower walls, and black & white tiles on tabletops, as well as a Coachella ready bullhead hanging from the high wall. This place is a order first, seat yourself second! Many choices of açaí bowls, smoothies, savory paninis, soups, and a variety of drinks including coffee, cold brew on tap, kombucha, wine, beer, etc. I ordered a spicy baked eggs in a bowl of tomato and black bean stew. My boyfriend ordered an egg sandwich and a walnut + fig toast. They were both delicious dishes! Very hearty meals. I'd love to try the salads and smoothies next time. It's a good mix of choices for the bigger, hungrier stomach or a light bowl of goodness for those who enjoy their greens! The baked goods looked awesome in the case and in the back it looked like they were making some more in-house! Fantastic atmosphere and staff were friendly.

"This is a pretty cool place to get work done - I came by on a Friday after lunch and this place was packed!  The line to order was pretty long and finding a place to sit down was a struggle, so be wary of that if you do decide to drop by.  They have some tables that people work on upstairs (but those were all full when I came by), and some tables downstairs (some of which are reserved for people without laptops).  As the day went by (mid-late afternoon), I noticed that the place got significantly less busy and seating opened up.  Wifi is complimentary and outlets are limited.  I had the cold brew coffee ($4.50), and I loved it!  They serve it from the tap and it was exceptionally smooth + frothy.  If you're in the area and it's not too busy, I'd definitely recommend a stop by here if you need a caffeine boost or a place to get some work done.",4.0 star rating

"You must try the warm quinoa salad and the banana bread! The salad includes kale, brussels, sweet potatoes and quinoa of course. It's covered in a citrusy dressing that puts it over the edge. The banana bread was thicccck and not too greasy or heavy like it sometimes is. I'll definitely take one to-go next time. We also tried the walnut and fig ricotta toast, the crazy cookie, and the almond butter + preserves bird bread toast. This is the type of restaurant where you should go with friends and split a bunch of small things since most dishes are pretty filling and can be rich (especially the toasts). Overall everything is super fresh, presented cleanly for your aesthetic needs, and definitely tasty at a very reasonable price.",5.0 star rating
"Best coffee and best mocha in SF to anyone who has actual tastebuds.  Every time I get a Mocha anywhere, I have to ask them to make it half as sweet as they normally do.Not at Ritual!  They use dandelion chocolate, and the Mocha comes out perfectly rich but not sickeningly sweet.  It is gorgeous. The baristas at this location are very friendly and helpful. Someone posted bad review about there being no WiFi.Of course they don't have WiFi! This coffee is fantastic but the space is too small to accommodate lounging all day on work computer... so duh.  If they had wifi there would be no seats ever.",5.0 star rating

"Came here on a Sunday at 9:30am to find no seats and again at 11 to still no seats so I wouldn't come here to study or sit for a very long time on a weekend morning. We wanted to get the ""Golden Lady"" but unfortunately they were out of stock of the ginger syrup so we got the Dandelion Mocha ($6.25) instead. I believe it uses dark chocolate so it's not that sweet at all and has a very strong cocoa taste, which I happen to love! Also got a lemon poppy donut ($4?) which was good but definitely could've passed on that.I'll admit I was a little shook when my total was $10.25 as I don't think I liked the drink and donut enough to want to pay $10 again, but I can see myself coming back for a regular cup of coffee ($3.25).",4.0 star rating
"You know that I believe in Ritual Coffee's branding in SF. This one is on Haight Street and I did not make a purchase until today. The interior is medium minimal and not the complete experience. I took a Lyft to Haight Street and got to this coffee shop too early. Note: It opens at 7am not 6:30am. So I had no idea what I should get. I asked for something on the menu and they did not have it. So then I chose ""Gakoma,"" which sounds like ""glaucoma,"" the eye disease. It was an overpriced coffee after all at $4. I asked for some milk and I didn't know where it was...then I wanted soy milk and I got it from the counter dude. I was lost in my experience today. The menu is confusing and eccentric. They don't have the ""cherry bomb"" like in the Castro. I didn't even see chai on the menu...so the menu is different at different Ritual Coffee shops. This one on Haight does not celebrate Haight Street. This is overpriced coffee!!! Ritual is a unique experience because of BRANDING. But it's OVERPRICED.Review #2020.",4.0 star rating
"I couldn't help my excitement as I saw this from fellow Yelper's post and spontaneously stumbling upon Ritual. I was walking from The Painted Ladies to Haight and Ashbury when me and my friend from Japan I was touring both needed to use a restroom. So we decided to stop and check Ritual Coffee. It was a perfect tourist detour to drink and recharge before heading to Haight and Ashbury.1. One locked restroom is available upon request2. Many tables, a window seated corner with red cylinders. At first look, thought were seats but, what I actually realized were tables.3. I only spotted one outlet to charge a mobile device.4. Order then pay. I was sort of confused on how the payment worked. Thought it would be after you get your coffee because the barista was still making drinks after I ordered. But I guess he was busy.Awesome trip!",5.0 star rating

"Ahhhhhh Ritual. Now specifically, the Haight location is more of a cozy, secluded place--where you can enjoy your cup far from the busy bustle of SF streets (in comparison to some of the other locations). You can still get your fix with the included benefit of easier to find parking. I tried many a drinks here, I find their espresso to be more on the acidic palette, but it's rarely detected when consuming say a cappuccino or a latte. Their coffee has great body and mouth feel, but the notes and acidity aren't for the faint of heart. They take their coffee seriously and it does show through what they produce. Another note, your coffee will never taste the same come the new season...for they have seasonal espresso blends come in every season change. They have sometimes circulated previous espresso blends, but in other cases (i.e. Teen Age Riot, Acid Test) are special on occasion or temporal exceptions. Meaning they make blends in compliment to whatever season it is as well (i.e. Cabin Fever in Winter). Don't ever change Ritual, as well as your notes of Angst and Freedom.",5.0 star rating
"College student here and I always come to this cafe but the baristas are unfriendly and inattentive. When asking a question, I was told by one of the baristas to ""order at the register"" and I was asked if I ""can wait,"" which I gladly agreed. This is my THIRD time at this cafe and the service depends on the person. The coffee is a solid 7/10 and I've ordered their lattes, but I feel like it depends on the person who is making them. Once I had a latte in which the espresso was still sitting at the bottom and the milk was at the top! Also, I typically order almond milk and on one occasion, the barista had forgotten. Because of a milk allergy, I found out that day by feeling sick, which was honestly not fun.One thing that they have never done was ask for my name for my drink. Also, it would be nice too if some of the baristas didn't try to ring up customers as quickly as possible.... Ironically, they often they treat older customers with more respect, attention, and patience. It is unfortunate, because I have plenty of younger friends who would have enjoyed coming here FOR THE COFEE. However, with service this disappointing, I hope this review serves as a warning to fellow students.If you are a young 20-something or go to University of San Francisco nearby, please please please, I urge you to go elsewhere for coffee! This is not a place for friendly service.",1.0 star rating

"I used to go to this place a few times a week for my morning coffee fix, however, the quality of food, beverages, and service slowly declined to the point where I decided not to return.A few things to note:-Coffee is just as bitter as an artisan 7/11 or McDonalds roast-Bread has been stale multiple times-There are always gnats flying around the cafe, which is disgusting if you are either waiting for your order or eating there-Service is slow, and they are a bit abrupt with their customers-I'm assuming this cafe is a sole proprietorship because they require a $5 minimum to use a DEBIT card or Apple Pay...I really hate blasting businesses online, but I felt compelled to write this review.

"Environment: We went around noon on a Friday. The place was already bumping with people. People come and go and there seems to be at least one open seating at all time. Since you have to pay for WiFi, we were there to read instead of working. We grabbed the only couch in the room and lounged. It was a perfect spot. Granted, the whole place is kind of small so all the seatings were clumped together. Not very much of a walk way. Order: I ordered a Hot Mocha Mint. It tasted very delicious. It's warm, smooth, sweet and minty. The foam on top added a nice touch to it. The mason jar is also hella cute. My friend ordered a Purple Rain Smoothie, which I had a sip of. It's not a thick-smoothie. It also wasn't sweet as in it tasted very healthy. We didn't get any food but everyone around us did and it smelled super good. Service: The staff was nice and engaging. They don't mind waiting for you to make the decision and are helpful with recommendations. -1 for the paid WiFi. Other than that, everything else is great. Would go back there to read and lounge again.",4.0 star rating
Save your money. Gave this place two tries and both were horrible. Purple rain has no flavor. The second time got the yellow crush which has no flavor and has a bitter after taste. Got a tomato bagel with swish cheese with you guessed it NO flavor. Wish I had salt and pepper in my car. Also the guy at the cash register is hard to understand and turns to be quite rude if you ask to repeat himself. Not my fault he speaks really quickly and mumbles and has a thick accent.

Recently stopped in for a sandwich. Been in the neighborhood for years and first time here. Got the BLAT and was pleasantly surprised. A bit pricey but you get a side salad and the sandwich was really filling. Fresh ingredients although I could've done without the lettuce seemed a bit on the wilty side. Friendly service. One note a guy maybe the manager/ owner was there at the front register abruptly told the other person behind counter to take over and didn't communicate to me at all what was happening but stood behind the counter drinking coffee. I thought this was unusual. I have been in the restaurant industry and always take care of our customers first. However I will come back to try the adult beverages and small bites.

They also have iced coffee if you're into that sort of thing. Cold brew is also available. Does anyone remember when Starbucks served alcohol? I think this place has been doing it before it became cool. They have a good selection of local brews. I say local because I noticed Anchor Steam and Fort Point KSA on the chalkboard menus.

"I've never written a Yelp review. Even though I signed up years ago. This is my first. But today I was inspired. Really inspired. Not by the coffee or the tea, or the food - but by a girl (woman). I'm what you call a ""die hard, old school romantic"". I always have been. You can thank my Southern grandfather. And this post might not even make it to the review section. But I met the most beautiful woman here today standing in line, with an equally beautiful and engaging personality. Skin dark, brown and smooth and fine like silk. And yes, She was ""Fine"". And when she smiled it was as if there was no-one else here. Her skin and smile - flawless. She was dressed very casually. Like you would on a Saturday afternoon in the bay when your running errands. We engaged in some very small talk while in line. And for whatever reason, I was not my normal cool self. This woman had me stuttering. Yep. I was nervous. After the small talk we sat down on separate sides of the coffee shop. And I couldn't help but look at her and think how do I get over to her and introduce myself, after all - she was eating her meal and reading a book and I didn't want to intrude. SO I decided to write her a handwritten note. Yep, told you I was an old school romantic. Now, how was I going to deliver it? Well, after about 30 minutes she got up and walked by me - I said ""excuse me"". And from there I engaged her in more conversation - however, this time there was more depth to it. She is smart, witty, and maybe even appreciated my goofy nerdyness. I handed her the letter. She smiled. and she said ""I will read it later"". She could of left after that - but she didn't. She stayed another 5 or 10 minutes.  Good sign? I guess. In the letter, I left my cell and email. Now I wait. For love? A new friend? who knows.So if I must leave a review for the Blue Danube here it is. The green tea tasted like an elixir of love. Magical. (yeah, I'm corny too, I know). Because when I was talking to her, anything I drank here would be magical. I love the chill atmosphere because it made it easy for me to engage her in a conversation. And to top it all off today the music playlist was classic rock from the 70s!!! the soundtrack of my childhood. I've been here 4 hours and I've heard The Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, Carly Simon, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Boston, ya feeling me yet? All the classics! The music that got me started playing guitar and the music that I play to this day - Still, everyday. It was just incredible all the way around. These are the type of cafes I miss living in Detroit now. Cool, chill neighborhood joints. And we are across from one of San Francisco's Iconic restaurants. Burma Superstar. The staff here was super cool. Hey, maybe its just the ""love bug"" LOL! Cause everything about this place was what you expect from a great local coffee shop. I saw a few complaints about the WiFi and the $2 cost. I get it. We all want and expect free WiFi while sipping our lattes and green teas. I have a personal hotspot on my phone for occasions like this. Everyone doesn't. So thank you Blue Danube. I came here by accident today, but did I really? Is there such a thing as an accident? I met a beautiful woman here today who I may or may not ever hear from again. But you made it a magical experience and allowed me to release my inner romantic.",5.0 star rating

Foam held strong and espresso wasn't too bitter.

"Dropped by for a coffee while movers were packing us out of the neighborhood. The one thing I will miss about Mission and Valencia is great coffee shops. Super friendly, great coffee, bright sunny and colourful interiors. You can actually choose how you want your coffee made (strength, the machine they use to press it, and the rest of the ingredients like usual). Very cool spot, check it out!",5.0 star rating
"Decided to check out the new coffee place in town as I'm always looking for a new cafe to do work at. PROS:* WiFi* Location: isn't bad given that I was able to find free 2hr parking nearby, since parking is usually my biggest concern. * 5 brewing methods: you can choose which type of coffee you'd like and they can brew it by the V60, Chemex, Seraphim, French Press, and Siphon. (I saw the Stagg )* Opens LATE: they close at 8pm! So hard to find a coffee shop that opens past 5pm * Seating: 8 tables with 2-3 seats each so plenty of space * Coffee: uses their own roast! (customized mugs too)* Smoothies, coffees, teas, food, and pastries * Stamp card: buy 9, get 1 freeCONS:* Outlets: they have one at the front of the store, but it's not near the seats. Food:* Wake Me Up (Seraphim) - flavor was smooth but not as strong as I'd like, so I'd probably try a different brewing method or roast next time * OMG Sandwich - basically avocado toast with a boiled egg on top, but they add pomegranate seeds on top! Family owned cafe :) there's four of them working.",5.0 star rating
"Overly-loud pop music coming though the speakers greeted me at the door. There were only two other customers sat typing away on laptops when I visited. Super important: the fewer the customers, the softer the music should be. One can raise the music as the cafe fills with folk chatting, but as this is a cafe & not a disco, then I'd opt to not crank up the jamz ('z' usage intentional).UpForDayz is like a shiny, new penny at this stage. It still has its 'new business smell' even. Would that it had more of a roasted coffee smell, given that there is a giant roaster parked at the back of the shop. Perhaps the roasting on premises has not yet begun? Maybe the machine is for show? Time will tell, I'd imagine. The filter coffee is fine. The cold brew isn't. One pays $4.50 for what appears to be a 10oz glass filled to the brim with ice-cubes, cold brew then making up the difference. It makes for a watery beverage.The coffee condiment counter is located at the back of the shop, about 30 feet from the entrance. The rubbish & recycling bins are to the back of the shop as well. It's a slightly awkward set-up for those of us wanting a quick cuppa to-go. All is not lost. The staff is polite. And the window seats at the front of the shop are decent for people-watching. May this business tweak itself a bit for a slightly more user-friendly experience!",3.0 star rating
"When I first stopped by here, I thought Valencia St had already explored all the ways to serve coffee.  Boy was I wrong!Up For Dayz is next level.  They take coffee brewing to places I never knew it could go.  We had an espresso (exceptional!) and a new brewing technology called Ground Control (in photo).  I've seen Ground Control at a few other cafes in SF and can say without a doubt, it produces some of the smoothest coffee I've had. If you love smooth, not acidic coffee and exceptional customer service, check it out.  Looking forward to stopping by when I'm next in the neighborhood.",5.0 star rating
Decided to stop by to the new coffee shop and man am I impressed by all the coffee equipment they have. The place is very clean and has a warm welcoming vibe. They have a small roaster and I'm sure you can get a fresh batch. I got a Matcha Muffin and it was fantastic. I will definitely come back and try out the coffee. The staff is very friendly and nice.,5.0 star rating

"Just when I thought that all methods in which to brew coffee had been exhausted...UpForDayz hits Valencia st. and UpForDayz hits the ground running. The quaint cafe with a serious surplus of sunlight is not even 3 weeks old at the time of this review. UpForDayz started roasting their own beans in the summer of love in none other than the 'Holy Land' (Jerusalem) back in 1969; their love for coffee most definitely shows as they put lots of love into their cups of light, medium & dark roast coffee.What sets UpForDayz apart from other cafés aside from their serious machinery for brewing coffee is their warm and sincere welcome from the moment you set foot inside. They do not ask the impersonal and almost rhetorical, ""hey, how's it going?"" they actually say something along the lines of: ""Good morning, welcome!! How has your day been so far? To me, a few extra carefully crafted words make a world of difference!UpForDayz has a stellar staff!! Miguel is a master barista and always has a smile from ear to ear. Enrique, is super professional and always has a good recommendation in the coffee + pastry realm.I will not be forgetting the kindness of Mera, nor her broad smile of unfeigned delight. It will always be what comes to mind when I think of UpForDayz. Mera is an brilliant barista that takes the craft of coffee very seriously. As a matter of fact, everyone here is very knowledgeable about the various methods for brewing coffee. Two others that needn't be overlooked are Mousa & Rawan. This kick-ass duo of rock star baristas make coming back for more coffee that much easier. Their earnest and heartfelt kindness speaks volumes in my opinion. Even if their coffee sucked, (which it DOES NOT) I would still go back just to be welcomed with such a sincere and authentic attitude.UpForDayz, keep on doing what you are doing. You are all amazing individuals. Rock on!Your no. 1 fan,Johnny",5.0 star rating

"So disappointed. The outside of the coffee shop looks very colorful and inviting, however the coffee is so expensive. The ordering method is kinda cool but then once I realized I could have used my money towards a meal, it makes me cringe to come back here. As a native San Franciscan, its a very bitter coffee price to swallow. If you can afford it then do it. Otherwise, if coffee isn't the priority in your life, then just head down home and make your own cup. The coffee was also tremendously strong and I did not connect with the notes as when I would get at Philz when I am able to visit.",1.0 star rating

"I love this new addition to Valencia. We were missing a coffee shop like this. There's a ton of different coffee roasts and customized preparation methods. Our favorites are: Match made in heaven (a sweet and creamy version of their secret recipe), To the moon made through V60 (a light brew), and You will jump made with chemex (a dark Vienna roast). Perhaps my favorite thing at this cafe is the matcha mochi donut which I've had everyday since discovering it. My boyfriend likes the OMG sandwich which was light and delightful with avocado, egg, and pomegranate seeds. The staff are amazing and always knowledgeable. No matter what time of the day it is, they always greet you with a smile and are ready to help. I love this new cafe!",5.0 star rating
"This place is awesome - simple, and just good coffee. They have 2 different types of coffee per roast (light, medium, dark), along with 5 different ways to brew coffee. You read that right--FIVE. The variety in coffee and brewing methods gives you a lot to try, and they rotate the coffee every so often.The one downside is that there aren't enough outlets; but I don't think that it's a huge problem for this place. The ambiance here isn't really a ""coffee bookstore"" vibe where you enjoy your coffee and hang for long periods of time. It's more of a ""get killer coffee and enjoy it"" vibe, which I personally like!",5.0 star rating

Many of them seemed to order something just so they could take a quick break and, to be honest, use the bathroom.

"This place right here is something I love and hate sometimes. Lately, it's been more on the dislike side. I say that is because one time I took a bite into my beef brisket and it just tasted old or rotten. Like I immediately spat it out cause it just tasted sour. Another thing I personally don't like is the meat, a lot of it is frozen. You can tell it's not fresh once so ever, so personally that's how I kinda got that taste of the old meat. What I mean by frozen, is that the meat is not thawed out, they cut it frozen still.  Not to mention, the servers don't really check up on you. Sometimes have to flag another person down, which I truly dislike cause I know they didn't sit us down so it's really not their responsibility to help us. Then there some of the rude servers where they will personally cut up your meat for you outta nowhere and serve it onto your plate. I don't like that because I like my meat cooked a certain way and the last time they did this, they didn't check that one side wasn't throughly cooked. I really hate roasting a company but people gotta know the experience.I think the only thing I would say about the place that's a positive is the price is reasonable but if you go for the 2nd price which gets you more meat, definitely not worth it. I rather go to GEN if that's the case of paying more. The portion size is good as well. Well, that's all folks......For now.",3.0 star rating

"If I had to pick my favorite coffee shop that's slightly underrated in the city, it would be this place! I love this place and all the employees so much. It's my favorite spot in San Francisco to work or study. They have more than enough seats and when you walk in everyone is so productive. It's quiet and relaxing and peaceful, and I am focused when I come here so I always feel good when I leave because I get a lot done! The atmosphere is super chill and the music is relaxing, most of the time instrumental. It's not necessarily a place to socialize. The food is slightly overpriced but they have a good variety of food from sandwiches and salads to teas and macaroons and pastries. The restrooms are gross, that's my only complaint. There's also a YakiniQ restaurant that's next door and I think by the same owner. It's right in the middle of Japan town so the location is also superb. There's lots to do here, whether it's to kill time, do work or study, or eat and socialize with friends. Check this place out and you'll definitely come back a second time!",5.0 star rating

"I have mixed feelings about YakiniQ Cafe but I will be back! From the outside, it looks pretty nondescript and like nothing special, kind-of run-down. This aesthetic continues when you walk in: there's a bunch of comfy seating but there's bad lighting and it just looks old. There was only one person working there when I walked in around 9:45am on a Tuesday morning, but lots of people were at tables and seats reading or working, so it must be a pretty good place to work. Because there was only one person taking orders at the cash register and making drinks and preparing dishes and there was a line, there was a bit of a wait for my drink. I also worked there for about 15 minutes while I finished my drink and dish.I ordered the Yuzu Honey Tea and Lemon Meringue. I just wanted the tea, but there is a $6 credit card minimum so I added a baked good to my drink order and BAM by total went up from roughly $4.50 to $12. Well okay then. The Lemon Meringue was crisp and crunchy (from the meringue), with good but not great flavor that wasn't very strong or lemony. The Yuzu Honey Tea was pricey for what you get but refreshing and flavorful. The service could've been much friendlier, but I did feel bad she was working alone and must have felt stress to work faster because there was a line of people. I will be back to try other drinks, but I'll do so with cash on me!!",3.0 star rating

"This library-like cafe is owned by the same family that owns the bustling Korean BBQ upstairs where I remember eating a whole lotta meat that I was grilling myself on a hubcap. This is the spiritual opposite of that place where young Asians epoxy themselves at tables to stare intensely at their laptop screens. There was no conversation, no music, just the not-so-hushed tones of fingers clicking on keyboards. There were desserts in the display case, but I was interested in getting something warm to drink. Although I was intrigued by the sweet potato latte, I went with the more predictable $4.25 Ginger & Honey Tea (photo: bit.ly/2MmEhP2). I sat at a table quietly sipping alone, and it was a soothing balm on an atypically wintry evening.

"Rude, rude, rude! What type of person stares you blank in the face and fails to respond when you say ""Hi"" or ""Thanks"" to them? Well, happened to me twice at YakiniQ Cafe - the cashiers would rather ignore me and speak amongst themselves in Russian. They didn't even bother announcing when my order was ready. I guess I'm supposed to check their counter every few minutes? At least treatment was equal - they weren't very friendly to other patrons either. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I'm giving two stars for the ambiance, since it seems like a nice place to work - a good number of people were on their laptops. It looked like they were intensely studying. There were also a few couches to hang out on. If I lived nearby and needed a place to work, I'd consider it.The food, however, was pretty disappointing. I had the sweet potato latte - which was good - but nothing unique if you've had the Korean latte drink mixes before (Woori Market is around the corner - highly recommended). I wonder if they just used a drink mix and added some foam on top. I also had a slice of yuzu pound cake, which was very dry. The yuzu syrup on top was fragrant with a strong citrus punch - such a shame it didn't permeate the entire cake! Certainly a work in progress. It's too bad I tried it, since I would've actually given YakiniQ Cafe 3 stars without it.It's not a bad place if you'd like to get some work in Japantown - just don't expect friendly service and stay away from the pound cake!",2.0 star rating

If you would like to taste more of the sweet potato, then just order the original one. If you need caffeine then definitely with expresso~ enjoy every sip :)",5.0 star rating
"I'm a fan of this cute little cafe nestled in Japantown. Great spot for a catch-up with friends or a working session (free wi-fi woot).

I ordered a coffee and was told the credit card minimum was $6. Okay, sure, so I asked to add a bagel with cream cheese. The barista proceeds to say, ""Oh no, I can't do that. There are too many people today and I have no time to make that. Order something else."" So she shows me the ready-made cold croissants that are sitting on the table for who knows how many days and tells me to get one of those. I get one to avoid causing trouble.

"YakiniQ café was one of the easy places I go to for some good eats and drinks along with free WiFi, not the other Yakiniq which was the Korean BBQ of the left side.  Coming and looking inside this lovely café makes me feel like this was now my second home to settle down and read a newspaper.  Even though there are several houseflies flying in its vicinity, no fly would ever bother me while sitting in any table.  On the left wall was the cabinet filled with tin cans of Harney & Sons.  My aim to purchase in YakiniQ was to try none other than the tea flower.What makes this tea flower interesting is its lengthy steeping.  How long will it steep to picture perfection?  Depends.  The water in the clear glass mug was very hot, making the tea flower ball expand as quick as possible.  Viola!  After the tea flower sank to the bottom of the glass cup to complete its transformation, its tea color got darker, more bitter, and lukewarm.  Still tasted good; what mattered most was the tea flower transformation.  If I was patient long enough, the tea flower would look more beautiful.I'm sure there are other cafés out there that are good for tea flower steeping.  YakiniQ was the first.  Customer service turned out good and pleasant with nice working women.  Next time I come here, I be willing to have the same cup and see what happens if I go for seconds.",4.0 star rating
"One of my favorite cafes- my boyfriend and I are frequents here.Some of my must-tries:1. Sweet potato latte- I always get iced, bf always gets hot. Either way, so so so so so so good!!! This isn't your typical sweet potato powder latte... there's chunks of real, fresh sweet potato inside and it is such a treat!2. PB cookies at the counter in their jars. These cookies are perfectly MOIST- sooooo delicious! I was surprised they were made in-house.The only thing that's keeping me from giving this place a 5 is the fact that it's kind of expensive :( But given the location and the fact that it's in SF, I can't really blame them.

"LONG WAIT for food... yet its delicious. Dont go here in a hurry. Yet its patio is nice to relax on and enjoy the local smoker puffing away at their cigarette without a care in the world for others oxygen. Lol, I did ask the smoker to move and they did... yet besides that the atmosphere is inviting. I would've given 5 stars yet the gal at the sandwich board was meticulous yet incredibly slow paced at placing of all things on the sandwiches, making it take very long. I get the meticulous part working on sandwiches is a fine art I appreciate- yet it can be done in a timely manner... pretty sure I saw her arrange a couple pieces of onions on the side salad nearly four times. Slightly borderline OCD...but what do I know I'm not a doctor yet I have worked in a Deli for years and waiting for half hour -forty five minutes didnt seem like a feasible turnover for deli food. Also, when I got my sandwich it didn't have bacon on it... I said I had asked for it. She said it doesnt come on the sandwich, I said check the ticket.  Then she toasted some bacon to put on the sandwich to make for a longer anticipatory wait... all while there was bacon on top the toaster (I'm assuming ready to be consumed or maybe it was burnt). I dont know... youd think being meticulous youd also pay attention to detail like what's on the ticket. My sandwich was good nonetheless... and the side salad was also great. I got a Turkey & Jack, which had avocado and arugula on it. Their restroom is nice and the barista/cashier was easy on the eyes and very helpful. He suggested I grab a homemade pop-tart since that they make there and I didnt regret that at all since I was so hungry. If he didnt suggest that I prob would've gone behind the bar and made my sandwich myself. The brown sugar pop-tart was delightful.  Not to mention he made some amazing mocha art in our coffee.

"This place is so cute and naturally and brightly lit. It is relatively away from a busy area, although Divisadero isn't far at all.  It would be the perfect place to get work done on a weekend afternoon but THEY DON'T HAVE OUTLETS  Maybe it's so you can come in and go and they don't want you to stay or so it doesn't make it crowded- I don't know, but it kind of sucks. If you are meeting up with someone or getting some good (a bit over priced) coffee, then this is a great spot",3.0 star rating
"I come here almost everyday for a cappuccino, because it's the most consistently delicious of any nearby competition, and I love the staff. But did you know that it's not just for coffee anymore? If you stop by early evening, the light is just right, and now they're offering excellent (and reasonably priced) wines, along with meats and cheeses. To be enjoyed inside or out, which officially makes it my new go-to for a satisfying neighborhood happy hour.No, it's not the fastest place in town, but why's everyone always in such a rush?",5.0 star rating
"Cute coffee shop! Came here to study during the day on a weekday and it was still packed! Great place to work with a laptop, but hard to find a place to sit. Ended up standing by the window with my latte, which was pretty good but perhaps a little pricey.Didn't get to try any of the pastries but looked good, and it was fun to people watch!",4.0 star rating
"Environment: It's really warm in there. There are several seatings for 1 person )the bar, 2 people, 4 people, and a group (big table towards the back). I was sitting at the big table and there were several outlets nearby. HOWEVER, none of them work. There are no power to these outlets. WiFi: There is WiFi. It says that it's a 2 hours limit however when I asked for clarification with the staff, they said that it's a honor system. There wasn't that many people that day so the staff said that it's okay. I'm thinking it's because their WiFi is not that strong. Granted, we didn't stay long anyway because my friend's laptop died. Order: I bought a cold chai latte ($5.70 total). It tasted very good! One of the best I've had. I also ordered their poptart-like pastry. Ask the staff for their recommendation and they said the one with brown sugar filling (other options were apricot and Nutella). Not worth the money at all. It looks cute, but it didn't taste like anything. Couldn't really taste the brown sugar. The only delicious thing about it was the crust. Service: All of them were just chilling. They were helpful but seems uninterested. It might be because it's two days before Thanksgiving? Back to the point, I asked them to heat up my pastry. One of them put it on the grill and literally forgot about it. It took about 20 minutes for another staff to noticed it, looked a little confuse, and then yell out the order. Overall, the shop looks cute and super cozy. Chai Latte is good. Will I go back? Probably not.",2.0 star rating
"I really wanted to like this place, but I guess I am not cut out for pretentious SFO neighborhood cafes! Soulshine was WAY more fun and yum! We stopped here for some quick breakfast. The girl getting my order was so distracted with the other girl she was talking to, it took her 2 transactions to get 2 drinks and 2 sandwiches right, ugh. She was also super cold and not friendly. There was one guy (who honestly looked like a high school kid) making our sandwiches. Took him 15 minutes to slap cream cheese on bagels and add avocado to one of them. Fifteen.Minutes. I am not kidding about this - also, ours were the only orders he was working on. As I watched him slowly wrap each sandwich in foil paper, I wanted to snatch it out of his hands, he was SO slow. Call me impatient, but it really got on my nerves.The bagels themselves were too chewy, the avocado was browning and stale. Would I come back to this place? Nope..Totally meh experience, and way too overpriced for what we got, to be honest.",2.0 star rating
"Super cute cafe in San Fran that I stumbled upon. The space is a little tight for seating or waiting on to go orders which is my only complaint.

"Really cute coffee shop. I love the patio seating and the hip interior. The service was also good. I ordered a soy cap (see in photo how it looks like a latte?) and it was very good! However, after getting through the first layer of foam, I was sad to see that there was only an inch of foam in my cappuccino, thus making it a latte. Regardless, it was really solid. My cousin ordered granola and it looked very good as well. I'm allergic to bananas so I didn't take a nibble but the portion was nice. Lots of people in this cafe working and reading so it's a bit tough to find a spot during their peak hours.",4.0 star rating
"Classic SF coffee shop. I came here to do some work on a Saturday. While the WiFi was slow, I still enjoyed the ambiance and decor. I got a glass of rosé, a salami sandwich and a raspberry pop tart spontaneously.

"Without a doubt one of the worst experiences I've had at a coffee shop. Went with my wife this past Sunday morning. We got in line behind a man and his daughter who appeared to know the woman working the counter as they had a long conversation in Hebrew as he ordered. After they ordered and walked away, the woman behind the counter stood there for a good three minutes waving and making faces at the child who was now sitting at a table just outside of the cafe. Meanwhile, a line had formed behind me that went all of the way out of the door and onto the sidewalk. Yet she continued to make faces at the child. Eventually, she took a cookie out from a jar and walked it to the child before coming back inside (by now there were approximately 15 people in line behind me). When she got to the counter, she looked at me and said ""what?""No ""hello"". No ""good morning"". No ""what would you like to order?"" Just ""What?"" as though I was annoying her by being there. I ordered a latte and a buttered bagel, my wife ordered a latte and asked the woman whether or not she could get a bagel with avocado. The woman responded ""It's on the menu, you can read it"" Yes, we had the menu with us and it was confusing as to whether or not it was an option so my wife sought clarification only to receive a condescending response.I cannot remember the last time someone was so rude to us at a coffee shop, restaurant or any service industry position. It was mind blowing. It felt like she had a grudge against us for something but we had never been here before and had never seen this woman before. Beyond unacceptable way to treat customers. If I could give zero stars, I would. Finally, after being second in line only to wait over 15 minutes we had finally placed our order only to wait another 15-20 minutes for them to make two simple bagels!  As if that wasn't bad enough, the coffee was average at best, and the bagels were stale.",1.0 star rating

"1. No outlets, wtf. . . ok this cafe is aesthetically pleasing, but a lot of people come to do work and if we can't charge our devices, how do you expect us to get work done? There were three outlets in the back and all had a sticker saying ""no power"". A lot of my peers and I are students and are tired of studying on campus so we look for nice, ambient places to relax and get a change of scenery, we thought this would be the place.2. The workers aren't welcoming. I asked if they had coconut milk and received a disgusted facial expression. It was a simple question. Additionally, I brought left overs from lunch and wasn't able to go home and had nowhere to put it and was told in a condescending manner that I could not bring outside food, even if I wasn't going to eat it. Their reasoning was that it would stink up the place, which I think is such a minor reason to make a big deal out of. It was at that moment I felt unwelcome. 3. There's a two hour wifi limit, lol, ok. I mean the wifi already sucked. I really wanted to enjoy this place, especially the fact that it was barely 5 minutes away from campus.4. Expensive, pretentious, arrogant, ""wannabe"" hipster employees,I won't be coming back.p.s.

"The Randall museum gets packed full of small children and their parents running around learning things, so as a result Cafe Josephine also shares the same population. If you are looking for a nice quiet peaceful spot to grab a coffee and read a book, this may not be the ideal place for you. They have a cute little cafe space with a couple of baristas serving up high-quality coffee, tea, and bagels and sandwiches. There is a lovely outdoor patio space, however they don't provide enough tables, and as a result the four or five tables end up feeling a little bit cramped next to your neighbors. The overall vibe is like a watering hole for parents to restock on caffeine to continue running around with their children, while stopping in for a little snack break. The view is lovely though, and I would certainly return earlier in the morning for some peace and quiet.",4.0 star rating
"Well wouldn't this have been great when Law School Girl was little and we were at the Randall all of the time? Fast forward a bunch of years and yah there's a cafe at the Randall!

"We've always loved the Randall Museum and missed it while it was being renovated, but one of the best things about the renovation is the addition of Café Josephine: a much needed and long awaited onsite café and food stop for families.  Holding it's grand opening this past June 2018, Café Josephine just upped the Randall Museum's game.  This ain't your lame and basic park and rec food concession with limpy hotdogs under heat lamps, and packaged, processed, sugared up baked goods.  Owners Sahara and Jason are thoughtful about their food offerings, and Café Josephine offers up fresh, locally sourced and organic produce and food made to order.  Food is super fresh and delicious:  salads are tasty (the kale salad and egg salad is our fav), fresh baked cookies, homemade and healthy ""lunchables"" that kids love, made to order grilled cheese options and creative toasts (tartines), organic hot soups, and sandwiches too.  (...And we love that they add fresh sliced strawberries to your lemonade - it's the little touches that make the biggest difference!)  They make killer Andytown Coffee espresso drinks (and even have your Snowy Plover if you're craving it) and have a great selection of premium teas as well.The café is the perfect place to stop and take a deep breath with a coffee in hand (steamed milk with cinnamon for the kiddies) and take in the sweeping 360 views before you set out to conquer the City or about take on the Randall's animal room.  You're literally in the heart of the city, and yet you feel like you're miles away from it all.  Now go and visit!  You won't be disappointed.",5.0 star rating

Such a cute little spot. We came here on a Saturday afternoon and it was actually full. We were hoping to find a nice quiet place to sit down and get some reading done but we ended up just grabbing some coffee and walking around.We got a vanilla latte and it came out beautifully. It had so much flavor and them foam and crema was perfect. We even saw bits of real vanilla at the bottom of the cup. A little expensive but hey it's SF. We'll try to come back when it's less busy so we can enjoy the quaint vibe of this place.,5.0 star rating
"Normally I love cozy little coffee shops, but this place is just not up par to other coffee shops in SF. Here's why:- extremely limited options for milk.

"For a fancy coffee joint, it was just average for me.  If it's good espresso, then it should have a balanced taste.  However the espresso con panna tasted a bit sour. It may have been a bad batch of whipped cream.  However the cappuccino wasn't that impressive either. The milk didn't mask the subpar coffee flavor. I liked the decor and atmosphere. However the coffee is just average and the place didn't have that many places for me to work.  It maybe an ok spot for a few friends to chill and talk though.",3.0 star rating

"Sightglass is one of the top quality coffee brands in the city and is definitely a favorite of mine. I like this mission location a lot just because it is more of a to go place with some indoor seating and no wifi. People come as they please and the overall mood here is relaxing and peaceful. I got a chilled flashed coffee which was something that sounds very cool, but really means the hot drip coffee was poured into a cup with ice. I did like how sightglass encourages customers to bring their own cups/jars etc. The only thing that kinda grossed me out was that there was a horseshoe fly buzzing around in the pastry display and that turned me off from buying anything in there. But overall, good service at this location and would come again.",4.0 star rating

"Great hipster coffee place and a popular location for all the Mission folks. There's almost always people hanging out inside and on the bench outside with Sightglass drinks. I have yet to try their regular coffees, but the vanilla cold brew was very smooth and refreshing, albeit a bit sweet for my tastes. The mocha is hands-down my favorite drink. The chocolate is bittersweet, so its not overwhelming sweet like the typical mocha's you would get. You can also easily substitute dairy with almond or soy milk as well. Each hot drink is made carefully and with some kind of heart-like latte art too :) Wait time might be a bit longer as they don't rush the process. Condiments and caps are located in a corner at the back of the store. Also they take NFC payments and tap cards.",5.0 star rating

"Writing reviews for my 3 favorite Sightglass coffee shops. Video sketch on all 3 locations. youtu.be/CKyLAk5jzuQThis location is in Mission/Dogpatch area. Compared to shops on Divisadero(medium) or 7th street(large), the space here is small size. A lot of people come and go in the morning, so sometimes you have to wait for a seat. Because it's not a large space, crowd is more quiet. The lighting, color, furniture, tile, etc.. give you a warm and special feeling and their design theme continues in other stores like the one on Divisadero. Again, I think their coffee and the thought they put in spatial design is on another level :) Stop here to get coffee and then you can head to Tartine Manufactory to grab pastry. (5min walk) Only negative thing is it's difficult to find parking.",5.0 star rating
"Everything about Sightglass is literal coffee goals. I've heard about it many times from coffee folks, and have seen their beans served everywhere here in San Diego. I've finally visited it for the first time and was totally amused by it. Their aesthetics are on point, the elegant wooden coffee shop vibe with the honeycomb floors. Their coffee is great, and like I said earlier they have their beans for wholesale everywhere in California. It's almost a staple that good coffee is served here if you see Sightglass coffee beans. Not the biggest shop (I believe the one on 7th street is bigger with two floors), but everything about it screams SF. The baristas, the decor, the customers, you name it. You can tell they are passionate about their craft, and I absolutely love that. I would definitely come back with friends to try other items on their menu.",5.0 star rating

I've never thought a coffee shop like this would exist so close to a place I cherish a lot. The ambiance definitely caught my eye. The decor was spot on- very simple, elegant, and peaceful. This place is not your sit down coffee shop, it's more of a stop and go place. There are no chairs inside and it's a bit small. The menu consist of various unique coffee and tea.

I saw that they were closing in 40 minutes, so I rushed over from where I lived and managed to get in the door with about 20 minutes to spare.This is a small, but well-lit and clean shop. If I had to model my future kitchen area, I would use this shop as inspiration. It's minimal, no-nonsense, and really puts the focus on the coffee and how it's being made. I'd go as far as to say that the all-white interior was so that the coffee could provide the colour. I've been here twice, having ordered a cappuccino and a latte. Both times, I was in awe at how much grace and passion went into making my cup. The attention to detail in providing an experience was evident, as I also was passed a lid on a small saucer. Talk about making me feel special.Both coffees were ready to drink, at the right temperature right away. I couldn't taste any hints of the espresso being burnt, and it tasted oh-so-smooth. I knew I couldn't get my coffee from anywhere else now. I'm ready to spend a lot more money here in order to try everything on the menu.It turns out you can really taste the love someone puts into making your coffee.",5.0 star rating

"Briefly stopped by on a weekday morning & had a great time! I got the tasting flight ($4), which is 3 mini pours of their filtered coffees that averages out to roughly one regular cup of coffee. To be honest I'm not a prolific enough coffee drinker to be able to distinguish all the tasting notes, but even I could tell that each tasting of coffee was high quality and well brewed. It didn't have any acidic bitterness to it and was incredibly smooth (and caffeinated). The space itself is pretty small and minimalistic, which lends itself well to the modern coffeeshop aesthetic. There's no space to actually sit, just a two standing bars. The service is so incredible! The barista was so friendly & knowledgeable about the coffee and really made the experience enjoyable. Highly recommend!",5.0 star rating
"This is my new favorite coffee shop!Tucked on a hill in Chinatown/Nob Hill where the cable car runs through, The Coffee Movement is a lovely, small shop brewing up some of the best drinks!  This place is clean, minimal, and modern with great coffee-making tools and equipment.  There isn't much space besides a couple of high wooden tables to stand by, but they extended the area with some benches and their adorable van right outside.  The soothing lo-fi music that they play is perfectly accompanied by good coffee.I've tried their Vanilla Spice Latte (with regular milk and with almond milk), Cocoa Cappuccino, and Piccolo w/ added vanilla spice so far.  My favorite so far has to be the vanilla spice latte with regular milk because it is so smooth and delicious, with just the right amount of flavor.  The almond milk is also amazing and not overpowering at all.  All of the drinks I've had have been great.  They also serve pastries from Jane Bakery!I would say the prices are fair and definitely worth it.  The quality of their drinks and craft are top-notch, and they're super friendly!I keep coming back here because I just love the drinks and vibe here!  Highly recommend!",5.0 star rating
"I stumbled upon this shop by chance during my short (less than 24 hour) stay in San Francisco. This little coffee shop is so small, elegant, and welcoming  I fell in love with it the moment I walked in.I fell even more in love with the place after I started talking to the owner. He worked as an EMT before starting this shop. While talking to me he reflected on how as an EMT he was always the worst part of people's day, but as a barista/owner of @thecoffeemovement he gets to be the best part of people's day Found his words super heart warming. Made me think about how much passion and hard work goes into creating shops like these. Vanilla Spice Latte This vanilla spice latte tasted perfect and it was a fitting treat after 8am hot yoga on a Saturday morning (yes I'm gloating a little bit, go ahead and roll you're eyes ). It was a traditional latte made with house made syrup - vanilla infused with cinnamon and star anise.

This is the only place during his trip to Seattle & SF where he had piccolo with double-ristretto (and he has visited many cafes around the world, trust me) and made friend with Brian.So last weekend I came here with my spouse and sipped an amazing Ethiopia Reko 'spro from Madcap while she had piccolo latte.I am glad that I went here on their first few weeks; because I believe they will be flooded by customers soon when people finally realize this cozy and unpretentious spot is the home base of US Barista Champion 2018. Thank you for the delicious Ethiopia, Reef!",5.0 star rating
"My friends and I visited on a weekend during its first month of opening. Coffee Movement has the friendliest baristas and is a lovely, hipster coffee shop on the outskirts of Chinatown. The space is small but very inviting. You can enjoy your drink at one of the two counters, on the sidewalk stools, or standing at the vintage truck parked in front of the shop while watching the cable cars pass by.",5.0 star rating
"What a great little find for such deliciously well crafted coffee. The BF and I stumbled upon this place as we were searching for a good coffee place within walking distance from the restaurant where we had dim sum. Nestled under some residential apartments, the coffee movement would've been challenging to locate if it wasn't for yelp. So glad we were able to find it though because that spicy vanilla latte with the house made cashew/almond Milk was amazing. Our baristas were so friendly and obviously so proud of their creation. Aesthetically  the  interiors were beautiful and inviting. Seating is limited (non actually) but the do have high tables for lap topUsers. We were both super pleased with our drink and the complexities of flavors in their signature special. Can't wait to come back whenever we're in the neighborhood.",5.0 star rating
"Top notch coffee in a convenient location right on the Cable Car line. I ordered a cocoa cappuccino with their in-house made vanilla spice. It was DEE-LISH-US. Served at the perfect temperature with better than ideal flavor. It tastes like a warm, welcoming hug. The baristas are incredibly friendly. Some coffee shops come off a little pretentious, but didn't feel that here one bit! They made the perfect recommendations for what I was in the mood for. In addition to phenomenal coffee and warm, cool vibes, The Coffee Movement also offers fresh pastries. Overall experience was fantastic and I look forward to seeing this shop thrive!",5.0 star rating
"This is an amazing coffee experience! It's not really a place you would go to sit down and hang out as the space is very small, but if you're just looking to taste some really incredible coffee and enjoy the experience, I can't recommend this place enough!",5.0 star rating
"It's great to have a coffee shop in the neighborhood, even better when it is one that has a focus on providing such a high level of quality. It also helps that the owners Brian and Reef are very friendly, and are willing to answer questions and explain the differences between the various types of beans, not giving off the pretentious vibe that is often associated with quality coffee shops around SF. While a small space, they have done a great job making it seem bright and open, with a couple of high top tables to relax and drink. They have pastries from Jane Bakery available as well, which are some of the best pastries around. Finally, the price points are amazing, with cups of coffee in the $3-4 range, well below other spots around town. If you live in the neighborhood or walk past on the way to work, these guys should become part of your routine, and if you are swinging by on the cable car, they are worth the stop and they represent SF well.",5.0 star rating

"BEST COFFEE IN THE CITY BY ONE OF THE TOP BARISTAS IN THE WORLDReef, one of the two owners of this place, was crowned the top barista in the USA and second in the world competition. Bryan, the other  partner and co-founder, will talk your ear off and make sure that you leave with a smile on your face.The coffee is some of the smoothest and full in the city.

"Lovely little coffee shop tucked away in sunset. It's pretty easy to miss, just look out for the wooden sign hanging outside. Another one of those instagrammable places, I recommend the titanic latte if you want the aesthetic pic - it comes with a huge square marshmallow and also has  chocolate spread in it. My friend tried the mocha latte, which was also really good. Drinks weren't too sweet and there wasn't a line when we went on a Sunday morning. Wouldn't expect to study here though, they have wifi but very limited seating.Prices are what you expect for a higher end coffee shop, when I went the titanic went around 6-7 dollars. They have a selection of baked goods too, I'll try them next time I drop by.Parking's difficult, circle around on side streets for parking (we parked closer to GG)",4.0 star rating
"You must be a coffee enthusiast and a fan of their coffee to be going there consistently.I loved their House Butterscotch Latte and liked the vintage setting of the store but their spaces is extremely limited. I go to coffee shops to sit down to work and if that's what you want to do here, this isn't the place for you. There are 4 small tables towards the front of the store and some more sittings in the back and they do have a restroom, but with people constantly coming in and out in such a small place, you'll find yourself not being as productive as you'd like.The servers were not as friendly as you would expect for a local place like this as well. They also bumped up the music way too loud towards the closing time and it not just frustrated me but other customers as well because we all found ourselves trying to talk louder than the music.",3.0 star rating
"Cute little cafe located in Inner Sunset! I came here on a Sunday afternoon and absolutely loved the Iced Matcha Latte I ordered. Yay for paper straws!I would recommend this spot if you want to grab a quick drink, catch up with a friend, or get some reading/studying done. Check it out!",5.0 star rating
"Maybe the worst iced matcha latte with almond milk I have ever had. Came here based off of their reviews. Waste of almost $6. There were chunks at the bottom, maybe 4 ice cubes that melted as soon as I got to my car. Might try this place again for their coffee and will update my review then but never for their matcha. Threw it away and went to Starbucks down the street for a better matcha latte.",1.0 star rating
"Hollow is an independent cafe. I have stopped by like 3 times by walking by...and it turned out to be closed each time. For some reason, I couldn't coordinate my visits with their business hours. They are closed two days of the week. The menu is interesting and crafty. I decided on the matcha green tea latte! It was smooth and had a nice texture to the drink. It had a matcha green color that seemed natural and not made of food dye. It had a white heart inlay. It took a while for it to be made, but I made it. I had the drink in the cafe. I asked about the pastries and saw a blueberry muffin, scone, and they have empanadas. I could get an empanada another time. Then the lady decided to chop up some of her muffin cake to try. I had some pieces of the cake and it was good. So I gave her an extra star instead of four stars because she chopped up some samples of the pastry for me to try! Good tactic. Here's to you Hollow!",5.0 star rating

"Care to take an IG picture or get a quality cup of joe? Unfortunately, you can't get both here. Three baristas and two customers, yet it took 10 minutes to whip up a latte. The coffee beans were lackluster and unfortunately didn't shine through. It was basically steamed milk for $6.00. The large size is more like a medium size here at Hollow. It appeared to be a  ""hollow"" cup.Not to mention, the bottom of the cup had speckles of coffee grain. It wasn't filtered out! It seems like the baristas need more training or perhaps give extra attention in preparing coffee. I love supporting small locally owned businesses, but unfortunately this is one that I can not recommend.",1.0 star rating

"This cafe is small and cute. I loved the green exterior which definitely stood out as you walked by. I had the Matcha spiced latte with their homemade marshmallow. The drink sounds weird, but the combination of flavors paired beautifully. You can skip on the marshmallow, which was way too sweet.",4.0 star rating
"Tiny coffee and tea spot with a few baked treats and empanadas for food. Super cute green painted front with a bench and inside a few tables and chairs to eat/drink/work at. Mostly a Local pop in for real coffee. My cold brew was strong but not acidic. My kids had a Chai Latte and Vanilla Bean Latte and I've never see them finish before me,but they did! That's how good it was. While in this neighbor there's some good food to be had and dumpling shopping nearby. Parking is metered but there's some construction that currently limits the spaces. This place can get busy but also chill back down quickly. Surprised to hear they have been there for 9 years already.",4.0 star rating
"What started as a quick detour to grab a cup of coffee resulted in a pleasant distraction we did not regret having at all.Real, tiny coffee shop that isn't hard to miss due to its rustic, modern SF look. I swear the storefront can look like the shed in the back of anybody's house but there's definitely more than meets the eye when you realize upon entry. The shop fits over what you'd expecting looking from the outside. Anyways, the coffee was a great pick me up, we decided to pick up the vanilla bean latte and the butterscotch latte. What stood out the most were their selection of sweets. I let temptation best me when I decided to nab one of their cashew cookies... It only led to regret in not grabbing my seconds first. Ah... I'll leave it at that.",4.0 star rating
"This is a great spot to sit and escape from the craziness that is residency... if you just want to get away from everything, you should check out this adorable spot! It's so peaceful and you'll be able to enjoy a nice drink. My only complaint is that the benches in the back are very unstable. Yes, there's seating in the back! I love the rustic look but those benches have to be a safety hazard hahahahaa. I'm totally joking but I would prefer more comfy seats :P. I wanted a matcha latte but failed to realize they have a spiced matcha latte. But it was a pleasant surprise! It's a very nice level of spice and I would def get it again.",3.0 star rating

The only ""outdoor seating"" they have are benches right or front.WHAT I HAD:LARGE FRENCH PRESS COFFEE - $4Smooth tasting hot coffee. Can't complain!MUSHROOM EMPANADA - $5.50This place serves a variety of empanadas and I chose this one because of the ricotta cheese. It was quite tasty and quite small--which made it feel pricey. All the pastries at the cashier was exposed and I'm unsure how many people ordering had their saliva sprayed on them. I would prefer seeing them covered. As cute as this place may be, it's not a comfortable spot to sit and do work.  Some tables are too low and there is no wi-fi.",3.0 star rating
"Honestly I'm shocked at how someone can mess up latte art with 2% milk... I've seen photos of this place everywhere and it looked so cute! May have been the barista but I was highly disappointed. Not only that, but the latte itself just tasted like plain milk. Seating - very limited space which I didn't mind because it is sf. Only problem I had was how wobbly these tables are, saw previous reviews about this and I guess they never bothered to fix it.Gave this place 2 stars because at least the food was good - I had the chamomile cupcake and the oatmeal cake. Didn't taste any chamomile in the cupcake but it wasn't bad. Not sure if I want to spend $20 again on two drinks and two pastries, but I guess this is sf haha",2.0 star rating
"I am going to sound super childish, but I could not get over how cute and clever ""The Titanic"" was. It's literally the dark mocha but with a huge square marshmallow. With how pleased I was with this drink, I will definitely be back to try all of the other coffees. This coffee shop has to be one of my favorites. Maybe I came on a slow day, but the ambiance made me feel so comfortable and relaxed. There is a back area for extra seating but I chose to sit by the lit up windows and just people watched.

"Cute little cafe in inner sunset!This place is very tiny but super cute and well-decorated. I got small size Titanic II (mocha with homemade marshmallow $7ish) and it was amazing but pricey. I like how they came up with that name though! so unique and cute! My friend got matcha latte($4.50) and it was good but just average matcha latte to me. I've had better one elsewhere.

"Best Cafe in Town!!! Thumbs up emoji x 100!!Usually 3 things i look for when i try to critique a cafe. Ambiance, Taste, and service. All really good! I got vanilla bean latte, which was pretty damn good, and a caramel/butterscotch glazed cake/bread! It's displayed in the front of the cashier. That cake was just amazing. It tasted even better with the vanilla bean latte. I like it very much when my drink and pastry just blends in well! The owner was very friendly and so was the barista. I think its usually just the owner and one worker working together. I've been here twice. It also seemed like most of the customers here are regulars. As a tourist, i highly recommend coming here for a grab in the morning and find a bird (scooter) and go inside the golden gate park! It's what i did and remains as the favorite part of my trip!",5.0 star rating
"When I got back from my semester abroad at the end of my junior year in college, I was an absolute nightmare for everyone around me. (Consider this Yelp review a belated apology.) One of my friends, who had just returned from her own stint abroad, was also pretty down in the dumps with reverse culture shock. We decided to vent to each other over a coffee break here, since we had heard Hollow was the epitome of minimalism with a more rustic IKEA vibe. I brought an IKEA catalog with me because I felt like we needed some European reading material to peruse.I didn't study abroad in Sweden. And my friend wasn't even abroad in Europe.Ah, the naiveté of youth! The vanilla bean latte was just warm and sweet enough to soothe my no-longer-abroad heart. My friend didn't have any complaints about her spiced matcha green tea latte. (She stayed on brand since she studied abroad in Japan.) The only other person there was on his laptop, trying to work in a coffee shop that didn't offer wifi, so in other words, he heard every word of our rant on the abominable American car culture.Come here if you want to catch up with friends, not if you want to be productive, because you'll probably get distracted by a bunch of entitled millennials. Too bad they can't be thousands of miles away from you in some foreign country, huh?",4.0 star rating

I'm not sure how this owner screens his applicants but bravo because every individual who works here has such a kind calm soul.Thank you Richfield for keeping me caffeinated and happy.",5.0 star rating
"Super sad/disappointing - they have DISCONTINUED the ricotta toast. (they said they were replacing it with something soon.Service was painfully slow. looks like the avocado is smashed to order - which maybe I would enjoy - but since they get an order for it every other customer - maybe make a batch for 15 toasts, then start again - it would still be super fresh - but faster.We ordered the avocado toast and the breakfast sandwich (it was light on bacon - maybe 1.5 slices), a chai and a mocha. It was about $25. we left hungry.The water glasses could be used as thimbles - seriously I have never seen smaller glasses.",2.0 star rating
"The Richfield is a great local coffee shop with a good amount of outdoor seating to relax at!  I've gotten the cold brew ($4.50) a couple of times and it tasted a bit lighter than what I'm used to getting at other places, but it was still smooth and pretty good.  Something I super appreciate and love about this place is that they serve their cold brew with coffee ice cubes so your drink doesn't get watered down!  It's such a small and easy thing to do, but I've never seen any other place do this before.  It really shows that they care about their product and it shows they care about their customers' satisfaction.The couple of times I've been here, the toast has been sold out unfortunately.  I usually come later in the afternoon, so I'll be sure to make a visit earlier in the day sometime to try those out!  Definitely recommend a visit if you're ever in the area.",5.0 star rating

"I was in the area and wanted a coffee and stumbled upon this place. The Richfield is a small little coffee shop in the Inner Richmond district. There are a few tables inside and outside, and they offer free WiFi. There is a nice vibe here, I saw a couple people chilling and some doing work! I looked at the menu and ordered the Cold Brew. The Cold Brew was good, smooth and not too bitter.

What a cute little coffee shop! It's pretty easy to miss as it's in a funny triangle at California and 5th. This is what good coffee should taste like.After living in Australia for a number of years I'm always on the lookout for a real Aussie style flat white and this did not disappoint. Exactly the right size and the espresso was smooth and perfect. I was only visiting SFO for a couple of days and made sure to come back 2 mornings in a row to get my FW. I found them on Yelp and they definitely earn the great reviews.,5.0 star rating
"I have been to many coffeehouse while traveling and few of them make a quality cup of coffee.  Richfield does not disappoint.  Our group had lattes, a flat white, and an Americano.  All of these had the correct ratio of milk to espresso, or water to espresso, along with correctly pulled shots. The baristas obviously love coffee and put that love into each cup.",5.0 star rating
"Brekkie Sandwich - lives up to the hype.  Simple ingredients, but delicious.Cold Brew - they use ice cubes made with coffee to keep the brew from tasting watered down as you savor every sip.  So novel and simple that not even the big coffee chains do it.  Props to The Richfield on that.Seating - they promptly opened at 7:30 and I got one of the few seats inside.  Enjoyed a good book while eating and drinking.  Small interior, but very relaxing.Will try their Avocado Toast and a hot brew next time...",5.0 star rating
"Have you even gone to a coffee shop and asked ""May I get a cup of coffee"" and received the snooty response ""well, this IS a coffee shop.""?  I have a couple of times over the years and don't really appreciate the sarcasm, particularly when I still haven't had my morning cup.  And while I haven't been given this response at The Richfield, I feel like they want to say that.  If you ask for a cappuccino or latte with non-fat milk (as my SO often does) you are at the very least told that they don't have non-fat, but might be told the additional detail that non-fat milk doesn't make quite a proper type of foam.  Don't get me wrong, we like the Richfield food and coffee and enjoy the boxing theme and old copies of The Ring magazine to browse.  And the location is sort of cool - what for years was a wedge shaped island off of California is now a small 2 story building with The Richfield in the lower floor.The breakfast items are tasty and well made, the coffee drinks are good (though I have a couple other preferences in SF).  So we stop in when we are in the area and in need of a bite or coffee.  Prices are a touch high, but not out of line.  They don't seem big on substitutions, and if you want almond milk be prepared to fork over another $0.75 for your drink.  And ask for Earl Grey tea (the preference of my SO) and they may look down on you as being too pedestrian (which is funny because there is no parking in the area so only pedestrians can get there).It just seems that they have a bit of an attitude - maybe it's the boxing décor that brings it out in them.  Hopefully it won't turn people off from going there - though there is a bit of competition in the area with Beanstalk, Blue Danube, and Cumaica all within a block or three.  I expect a bit of attitude in the Marina or SOMA, but not in Inner Richmond.So 5 stars for the food and boxing theme, 4 for the location and coffee, 3 for the limited tea selection and perceived attitude.  A 4 star review.",4.0 star rating
"I love this tiny coffee shop in the median of an intersection. It's a cute neighborhood spot to pop in for a coffee or a snack.I just get whatever latte or ice coffee drink that I'm feeling that day, and (if I'm lucky), snag a seat at one of the 3 tiny, 2-3 person tables they have. When the weather is nice, sometimes there are 2, 2-seater tables outside.They also have a little counter that I've seen some people stand at to do work. I personally don't find the environment conducive to working, but it's fun to people watch and read a little on a slow day. I also tend to prefer small cozy coffee shops to large ones.The service is friendly, the drinks are pretty average (though they have a few interesting selections and a large variety of tea), and the food is pretty unique. I think the breakfast sandwich is popular (but not a stunner, according to my NYC-breakfast-sandwhich-loving friend). I have also tried the sesame ricotta toast topped with strawberries, coconut flakes, and honey. It's an interesting combination, and I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure if it completely worked. Maybe in strawberry season, when the strawberries are a little more naturally sweet, it would make sense.Almond milk is extra and they will remind you like Chipotle employees remind you that guac is extra.",5.0 star rating
I don't write many of these but I had to write about my experience at the Richfield. As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a friendly smile and my order was taken right away. The place is tiny but has a comfy atmosphere. When my latte was ready it was brought out to me with another friendly greeting. Everyone here (employees and customers) seem comfortable and pleasant. The drink itself was excellent and the milk was super foamy. The almond croissant I got was also very good. There's also some outdoor seating to enjoy the weather when it's nice. Not a great place for working but if you just need a good drink and a place to read/hang out this place should be considered.,5.0 star rating

"Even if it was just a little neighborhood coffee spot with nothing more than their amazing beverage selection and some generic muffins, the charming ambiance, tasty coffee, and friendly service would still probably earn it five stars in my book. But what takes The Richfield above and beyond is their unique and delicious food menu. I was obsessed with the black sesame ricotta toast topped with fresh strawberries and coconut. I've never seen this combo anywhere else but as soon as I spotted it on the menu it was a where-have-you-been-all-my-life type of moment! Though it's teeny with just a few small tables, it's a great addition to this neighborhood and I'm jealous of people who live in the area and can stop by on the regular. I'll definitely be back on my next trip to SF!",5.0 star rating

3 stars because very few people like ice chunks in their ice cream.Got the affogato with the caramel ice cream and it had lots of ice crystals in it. Maybe I'm the only one ordering ice cream so the ice cream is old and cold and frozen over like Hell.The coffee shot on top was okay. A little bitter but overall not worth the $5 I paid.$4.50 plus 50¢ tip.Their coffee is on the strong side which isn't my particular taste. I'm more of a medium flavored coffee drinker. So overall 3 stars.,3.0 star rating
"Good boba is few and far between on my little island, so I always try to get my fix while traveling.  The brightly colored instagram worthy photos at Black Sugar caught my eye and piqued my interest.  After scrolling through the photos, they had me at mango matcha latte.  I love the strawberry matcha boba from another popular joint up the street, so this was right up my alley.  Much like their shop, they have a small, but sufficient menu that includes choices of milk teak, fruit tea, fresh milk, matcha, & coffee.  Their favorite flavors are on the left and you have the option to choose the level of sweetness for your drink.  Skimping on sweetness is pretty much blasphemy for me, so you know 100% sweet all the way!  They even have liquid cane syrup available for that extra sugar overload.Being a lover of all things mango, I went with the mango matcha latte of course and tried it without mixing it first just to see.  Got a straight shot of that sweet boba goodness and it was yuuuumm!  They were the perfect consistency, chewy and not overcooked.  I mixed it up as instructed and wow, I am a fan!  I loved that mango flavor which seemed thicker than the matcha layer (or it could've been the boba syrup?) and it was just divine. My friend & I loved it so much we went back for a second round of drinks before catching our flight!  The second time, I got it extra sweet, and yep, good decision.  Can't have too much sugar.  Ever.So, if you're staying in the Union Square area & love boba, GO NOW.  This shop is easily accessible and there's no line.  Don't blink though or you may miss it!  It's tiny with room to seat only four patrons, but definitely worth the stop.",5.0 star rating
"Whaaat, this place is different from the typical boba places that I have been to. They have different flavors that I would have never thought of doing plus a few standard ones.First time here, I tried the matcha sesame latte. It had the perfect blend of all the ingredients. Forwarding on this drink... you will get sesame in your teeth, so be sure to have some floss.. lol. The boba is cooked perfectly and has a slight sweetness to it. With this being said, I thought it gave the perfect sweetness to my drink (I requested no sugar) This has by far been my favorite drink in San Fran.Second time I came, I tried the mango matcha latte. It was very pretty and flavorful, yet I still loved the matcha sesame better. Other flavors I tried were pear green tea and the lychee green tea. The pear tea was sooooo good!

"The Mango Matcha Latte reminded me of a variation of the Strawberry Matcha latte at Boba Guys.  I ordered the Mango Matcha Latte at 70% sweetness with boba.  At first sip, you could taste a good mix of the mango and matcha, neither being too overpowering.  The boba however stood out to me as it seemed to be sweeter than the actual drink.  The boba was quite firm but not too soft.  The cup that the drink came in was cute and something that could possibly be reused.   The service was quick and prompt.  I came in on a Tuesday afternoon so it wasn't too busy.  I would suggest this place if you're looking for somewhere to sit for a while as they only have about 4 stools available.  Overall, I would suggest this place if you're in the area or if you're like me and you're always seeing pictures on Instagram of this place!  Definitely worth a try!",4.0 star rating
"Cold brew matcha latte and roasted oolong are delicious. Fruity teas are great as well. This place has good drinks, but be warned it's tiny. If you need a place to sit and chill you can always pop into the Hilton across the street.",5.0 star rating
"So f'ing good the first time - five stars. The second time was not as good - four stars.I'm conflicted because the first black sugar fresh milk with pearls/boba $4.45 was so damn good. The black sugar fresh milk tasted almost exactly like an ice caramel macchiato, which I miss since I can't have caffeine anymore. The boba texture was perfect. Bouncy and not too soft lol.The second time I visited, the flavor of the ""black sugar"" burnt sugar was weaker. The pearls were just as good as before. Both times we had about a ten minute wait after ordering because they were making the pearls. The freshness of their small-batch pearl preparation must be the key to the excellent texture. The taro milk with almond milk $4.95 is also a good option. They can't adjust the sweetness level because the taro and sugar is already pre-mixed, but not to worry -  it's not too sweet. The tall guy at the cash register has good customer service skills. I noticed he is careful to tell customers special instructions. It's still one of the top places for boba in the city for me even though I actually don't drink milk tea. I don't know how anybody finds parking around here. We take public transportation or a lyft to the mall/union square for shopping and then come here afterwards. There's an expensive parking garage next door. They only have four or so seats inside. Halal Guys is next door which is convenient in case you want to order some food to-go while you're waiting for the boba to be prepared.*I was wrong about a charge for almond milk. Management let me know that it's actually no extra charge for it. Thank you!They haven't addressed the plastic and/or recycling issue though. The thick plastic cups seem kind of wasteful especially since most people don't recycle them and the shop doesn't seem to recycle them either. The cups have survived my dishwasher and I've reused them multiple times - bpa be damned.",4.0 star rating
"Finally got the chance to come visit Black Sugar. We arrived on a Sunday morning a few minutes before it opened and there was already a couple waiting in front of us. Soon after, more people were gathered in line. I ordered the Taro matcha latte with boba (subbed almond milk). This drink comes with a non-customizable sweetness level but I did not think it was too sweet. I really appreciated that you can sub almond milk without an extra charge. They use real taro but it was smooth, not gritty. It added a thickness to the drink. Make sure to thoroughly mix your drink, which the cashier advised. The boba was a good chewiness and added a bit more sweetness to the drink. The matcha was very aromatic. i tried my fiance's black sesame milk and that was also really good. The black sesame was not too gritty when swallowed, like some places make it. Will try the black sugar fresh milk next time! Although the drink is on the pricier side, especially because it's like a 16oz size, I think you're getting a pretty high quality drink that tastes great. Only three or four seats along the window inside, so this is really a pick up and go type of shop.",4.0 star rating
"Yay work friends! My work friend had been away for a while but finally made it back into SF, so a celebratory drink was in order. He's a bubble tea fan, so he'd had this place scoped out.I got the matcha taro latte (I am quite susceptible to Yelp peer pressure, then always insta-regret it). Like all other boba shops, you can customize the sweetness (usually, although not on the matcha taro latte) and the ice. The regular sweetness was actually not super sweet, though I almost prefer my teas to be slightly bitter.The drink was aesthetically pleasing, with the light green matcha atop the silky purple taro. The taro was well pulverized into a powdery form, lightly sweetened, but didn't really stand out in any way (e.g., super taro-y). The matcha felt a bit powdery in my mouth (maybe the taro got into it somehow?). It didn't taste like the low-quality powder mix some spots use for matcha, but it also lacked the deep richness I crave in matcha. The outside of the boba was slick, and the inside also had that slickness mixed with the chewiness. Boba is lightly sweetened, but I always think that the sweeter the boba, the better (omg honey drenched boba). Not watered down.The shop itself is pretty small, just a counter for ordering and 4 bar stools by the window. Clean, simple white and wood aesthetic like many modernly designed shops these days. There was a line 10 deep at 1:30pm on Wednesday.Overall, drink was a nice after lunch pick-me-up, but I don't think I'd walk out of my way for it. Maybe I should try the namesake next time! 3.5/5 overall",4.0 star rating
By far the best boba spot I have tried while on my boba excursion on Saturday. This shop is pocket sized with a pretty small menu. There's like 4 seats that faces towards the window so take your drinks to go. You kind of can't hang out inside because it gets full fast. I ordered the Mango Matcha with boba and my sister had the Matcha with boba. Mine had a good balance of Matcha and mango which made the sweetness perfect. The boba was good too. There was one cashier calling out orders while someone else was in the back making drinks. They were getting through the line that kept building up. I appreciated the efficiency. They also have sugar on the side if your drink isn't sweet enough and my sister had to go to it a few times before enjoying her drink. The regular sweetness in San Francisco is so different from Vegas. I started questioning if my drinks are actually too sweet to begin with.,5.0 star rating
"One of the best boba places in SF (and at a much lower price point than most as well). Cheaper than boba guys, same quality matcha. Milk substitutions are free too!Black sesame matcha is my favorite so far, their milk drinks and house milk tea are great too. Service is quick and friendly - stop by if you're in the area!Other pros: close to the mall/union square, and Kin Khao",5.0 star rating
"One of the best boba places I've tried in SF hands down. This place may seem like an unassuming hole-in-the-wall, but boy are they a boba powerhouse. We ordered the matcha mango latte with 70% sweetness, and we received our drink in less than 5 minutes after ordering it. Although the drink itself was still very sweet (a bit too much for my liking), I really enjoyed the creaminess and richness of the milk. The balance between the mango and matcha was truly harmonious, and the flavors itself were pretty subtle. The pearls were amazing - the perfect bouncy texture and size, and nicely sweetened. I would love to come back and try their tea-flavored drinks. Come here if you want unique, high quality boba.",5.0 star rating
"Black Sugar are known for their Milk Teas like Latte & Matcha. My friend got the Milk Tea was perfectly sweeten and the boba was chewy and I also got the Lychee Peach with Lychee Jelly. It tastes similar to Pit Stop Boba at Westborough because they use real Lychee! They don't use plastic cups, they use a higher quality cup for matchas and latte. With a simple cute logo. The place is simple and not that big. Limited seating. Staff was super friendly! The guy at the cashier always ask customers how their drinks are! But it's a good grab to go boba stop.",5.0 star rating
"BLACK SUGAR FRESH MILK FTW!!! I was so excited to visit this place because of all the good things that my friends have been telling me. I came here on a Thursday afternoon around 4 PM and the place had a line already. The line does not seem too bad and moved pretty quickly. I waited for about 5 minutes with 10 people ahead of me and when I go to the cashier, the girl who helped me was very nice and explained to me how there are certain drinks on the menu cannot be adjusted (sugar level). I opted in for one of their top favorites - Black Sugar Fresh Milk with boba. The boba shop is not too big but it is big enough for a couple high chairs where you can sit and wait for your drinks to be made or have a quick chat. Anyways- the drinks did not take too long to make and when I got my drink I couldn't help but Instagram it with the cute little lucky cat wall that they have outside the boba shop. The drink was really good and the texture of the boba was cooked just right. Pricing is not outrageous either for it being in SF. I am glad that they opened it in a walking distance from Union Square/ DTSF. I saw alot of people ordered their Mango Matcha Latte with boba and that looked really IG worthy as well. Next time, I will definitely come back and check out their other drinks!",5.0 star rating
"Solid boba shop in the Powell/Tenderloin area. I ordered the Taro Matcha Latte with Califia Almond Milk and it was very creamy and flavorful. Not too sweet! I tried my friends drink and it was a little sweet for the both of us. They kindly offered to adjust the sweetness level :) The boba was a tad too soft at first but the cool drink cooled/hardened it in a few minutes. I wouldn't go out of my way to go to Black Sugar but if I was in the area and was craving milk tea or a matcha latte, I'd go back. Service is friendly and quick. Check it out!",4.0 star rating
"My first time in San Fran... nice city but where the heck are all my boba places?!?! Where the Asians at?  The fug?!?! After walking for what seemed like 10 miles... those dang hills! Finally tracked down this boba place - The ONLY boba place that's offering my #brownsugarbobamilk and boy was I disappointed. Cute shop, tiny, 4 bar stools... order & go.  Service was OK, not sure why no one was manning the counter - until the girl saw me waiting, then a guy popped out from the back and took my order. My drink takes no time to make - if you've had it, you'll know.  Took a quick 2 mins and got my drink. Here they call it ""Black Sugar Milk""... welp, the boba is not as soft as others I've had, puts WAAAYYY too much ice - making the balance of brown sugar boba vs. milk like 50% milk - 20% boba - 30% ice; so gone in 60 seconds.  Tsk Tsk.  This is what I'd call ""desperately seeking brown sugar boba"" and I was, otherwise, this is a skippo!",3.0 star rating

"Top notch boba! I had their lychee green tea with boba (70% sweetness) and it was delicious. They said their 100% sweetness is not too sweet compared to other boba shops, and they were right. I usually get 25-50% sweetness, and 70% at this place was perfect. The boba itself is perfectly chewy and had a great dark, malty sweetness. I tried my friend's black sesame milk (with almond milk) and it was delicious as well. If you don't mind the grittiness that is normal with sesame, I highly recommend. It was sweeter than the green tea, so I'd go with 50%.All in all, tasty boba place. If I'm ever in the area, I'd stop by again.",5.0 star rating
"There aren't many places out there that do black sugar fresh milk with boba well. This is probably one of my favorite places that makes this type of drink. The black sugar and milk ratio is close to perfect and there is nothing else added except the black sugar and the milk, which I appreciate. No extra sugar or fillings. The boba is on the harder chewier side, so if you like that, this place is for you. I usually always get no ice for my drinks because I have sensitive teeth and I don't like drinking anything too cold. They only have a ""less ice"" option for this drink.... which I can never understand. Perhaps give the customers an option to add water instead of ice next time. Despite this, I still really enjoyed the drink and would recommend! Also, I felt like the prices were pretty reasonable. Interior: very small, there's a bar with maybe 4 seats that's right in front of the cashier. I can see lines flowing out of the store because there's no space! It's more of a grab and go type place.

"Wow, I like Black Sugar a lot! My boyfriend and I were in the city for the day and we wanted boba! We were in downtown and I remember hearing about Black Sugar so we decided to check this place out!The location is pretty convenient. It is a short walk from the mall. The store itself is not too big. It's more of a grab and go place rather than a place to hang out. They do have four chairs. I thought there would be a long line but we went around 2pm on a Saturday and there were only three people in front of us. We ordered one drink for each of us and they came out fairly quickly.My boyfriend ordered the House Black Milk Tea and I ordered the Oolong Milk Tea. Both drinks had boba. The Black Milk Tea tasted like Hong Kong Style Milk Tea.The quality was great and they had strong tea flavor. Even the cups were really good quality.Our drinks came out to be less than $10 in the heart of San Francisco. That's a steal! I cannot wait to come back to try their other drinks. Their other drinks looked really pretty and delicious too.",5.0 star rating
Heard about Black Sugar from someone and I've had it BM it for awhile. I usually don't make my way DT so didn't really have any chances to check out BS. Finally got to try it today. A lot smaller space than I thought. It's maybe 10x5 occupant space in front of the counter. I got the Roast Oolong Milk tea. They definitely know how to make a Roast Oolong MT right as it had that right amount of roasted and bitter tea flavor. The boba was just the right consistency of chewiness. The size of the drink was surprisingly small considering most places give you 24oz cup standard now while here gives you 16oz standard. BS is a lot like like Little Sweet in terms of flavor and texture at least for their Roast Oolong. Though little sweet gives you a larger cup and it's much more convenient for me to go there than coming to BS. All in all quality tea and boba but smaller than I'd like.,4.0 star rating
"Really nice coffee shop. I was visiting from out of town and stumbled on this place when I was looking for a coffee shop near my hotel. I typically don't like experimenting with new and different coffee drinks (I stick to my usual iced or hot latte), but I decided to be a little spontaneous and asked the barista what he'd recommend, which was some sort of New Orleans drink. I really enjoyed it and now hate that I'm rarely ever in SF cause it was really good. I gave them 4 stars because I wish they had more food options. I was there around breakfast time and they only had a few cookies and croissants, not a lot of options.",4.0 star rating

"So I am a big coffee fan. I grew up in Cambodia and traveled to Vietnam a lot and these are big coffee drinking country so coffee was my go-to drink ever since I was a kid. I'm always out looking for the best coffee in every city and here I am at another great one in the city, Blue Bottle Coffee.Blue Bottle has become big enough that they are in whole foods and have multiple locations in the city, but that doesn't mean they become overrated. This is the first time I've been to one of their locations since I usually just pick up a cold brew at Whole Foods so I was pretty excited. I'm also a sucker for aesthetically pleasing coffee shops so I can get instagram worthy shots as well so this place was a hit! I got the Cafe Mocha with Hayes Valley blend and asked for very little sugar and it was amazing! The latte art is nice and cute and they filled it up to the very top so I hate to walk like an old lady to get to our seats and grab an instagram worthy picture. I also LOVE marble and this location is filled with marbles as their counter/tabletops. So aesthetically pleasing, check, marble, check, great looking cup of coffee, check AND coffee that actually taste as good as they look, CHECK! I love everything except the fact that they don't have wifi or outlets. This is pretty shocking to me because there are decent amount of seating everywhere and working at coffee shop is kind of a thing for me, so it was a bummer. Now...I am writing this review, on my laptop here...but of course I have to tether myself to get internet and I have an external battery pack to charge my laptop so if you do still want to do some work here, I highly recommend packing some external battery and having tethering or some way to access the internet. Otherwise, it is more recommended for catching up with friends or some light browsing that you won't kill your battery for. This is probably the only reason why I would put this place as a 4/5 instead of 5/5.TLDR: Great coffee, Instagram worthy coffee shop, no outlets or wifi.",4.0 star rating
"A great coffee stop while walking around downtown San Francisco.We swung in to this location when we flagged the blue bottle logo; we had hoped to try it while in SF, but hadn't gone out of our way to find one yet.The place was steady when we were there at noonish on a Saturday, but it didn't take long to order. I got a cold brew (warmer in SF than Virginia this time of year, and I had been walking with my baby on my back, so I felt too hot for a hot coffee drink) which came right out, and was tasty and smooth.It was right on par with most local coffee roaster cold brews and would be a good go to for the warmer days. I can't give it five stars because my bar has been set (maybe unusually) high by a coffee roaster back in Virginia whose cold brew just floats down your throat, sending caffeine into your bloodstream like a spoon full of sugar as Mary Poppins would say. But I digress.My husband got a holiday blend drip, but we watched them make it and they made a pour over, so because it was a pour over it took a few minutes to come out. I'm not sure if they always do pour overs rather than a typical drip, or if something was wrong with their coffeemaker, because it did say drip on the menu, not pour over. His coffee was really good, hot and festive with a hint of spice, without having any overpowering, cloying ""holiday"" flavors.I would definitely frequent blue bottle if I was local to the Bay Area, and will revisit if I return!",4.0 star rating
Great coffee. Looks like it has classes for learning how to brew slow drip coffee. Nuff said.Ample seating with like ~25-30 ish seats to sit down and work at. No Wi-Fi and didn't see any outlets though :(. However there is the #SFWifi it is kinda slow and the Target Guest Wifi across the street. Very bright location with very big windows. Has some pastries and a great place to pick up some coffee making accessories. Not to packed on a rainy SF Saturday.Pros:-Supports Apple Pay.-Good amount of seating-Barista Training ($20 Brew Class Saturday 12-1PM)-Doesn't seem too packed-Bathroom exists before the elevators left of the security guard-Free Water beside the cash (they have cups you can use)-Not extremely loudCons:-No Wi-Fi-No Outlets (bring some USB-C battery packs for your Macbooks),4.0 star rating
"If I were simply reviewing Blue Bottle's coffee, I would comfortably give it 5 stars. In fact, I would be disappointed that I couldn't give it more. The New Orleans Cold Brew and their oat milk lattes are some of the best coffee in the Bay. I am also a huge fan of just about all of their pour overs, and even will grab a mocha from time to time. Nothing here has come even remotely close to disappointing me.There are two things that prevent me from giving it the perfect score, though. One of those things is the fact that the wait for coffee here is ALWAYS long. I came in at 6am one day, and it tool 6 minutes to get a latte. Granted, it was because they were doing training, but my goodness there were 3 of us in there. That's simply too long, IMO. Especially when their on-peak wait times are almost double that, if you're unlucky. It bums me out.Secondly, there is no Wi-Fi here. Huge bummer. I love this place so much, but I feel like a total loser going into Starbucks or Peet's with a Blue Bottle cup and just freeloading. I would come here a lot more if it were a realistic destination at which to do some work. Sadly unless I use my hot-spot, it is not. Woof.Anyway, the coffee and service here are fantastic. These folks know and love coffee, and you can definitely taste the care that goes into the craft. Just wish it didn't take so darn long. Or, if it were going to take long, that I could get some work done while I wait. What a shame!",4.0 star rating

"Blue Bottle is (admittedly) overpriced and extremely slow, but they are extremely consistent in the quality of their coffee. Amongst the different high end coffee shops in the city, Blue Bottle still reigns as one of my favorites (both for mochas and lattes). This one usually has a line out the shop since it's in a high-density working area. There's two payment areas but I've usually only seen one person behind the register, so the line moves pretty slowly for the high volume of patrons who frequent this shop. It probably doesn't matter in the end, though, because the space behind the counter is extremely small and the rate that the drinks are produced is alarmingly slow. There's usually a couple baristas for espresso drinks, and one doing the drip coffees and tea. I will likely still come to this location, but make sure you allot yourself up to 15m (or more) minutes during peak times, like in the mornings before work.",4.0 star rating

"This Blue Bottle Coffee is just plain cool. Nestled inside the lobby of a classic office building in downtown San Francisco, this modern bar looks almost as great as their coffee drinks. Access is though the lobby without a dedicated entrance with only street parking available. My Sunday morning visit was packed with Outside Lands visitors trying to catch a morning buzz. There were a few morning runners and maybe a few bringing a drink back to their Saturday night guest! This location has a pretty full menu including a wonderful reserve Rwandan espresso which was amazing on a cool and sunny morning. Gourmet coffee is a wonderful treat, and the Blue Bottle on Sansome is a wonderful way to experience it. The surrounding neighborhood is a little dead on the weekends, but I'm glad to see the living visit this outpost.",5.0 star rating
"Oat cappuccino - 4 starsI was hesitant when they told me they swopped their soymilk for oatmilk because of the added sugar in the soymilk. I've had oatmilk before and thought it was terrible. This changed my mind about oatmilk! The texture was amazing, and it had a rather neutral, slightly nutty flavour. I think I actually prefer this to my usual Bonsoy/unsweetened Silk soy lattes! Now I have to hunt this oatmilk down...Drip coffee - 3.5 starsTo be honest, I can't tell the difference between this and other drip coffees I've had. It's definitely better than the ditchwater drip coffee you'd get at a 3 star hotel breakfast, but beyond that I can't quite tell.Chocolate chip cookie - 2.5 starsVery average. It was soft and didn't have a memorable flavour.",4.0 star rating

"Blue bottle was my first coffee love when I first moved back to the bay about 6 years ago. Blue bottle taught me to appreciate a GOOD cup of coffee. Upon my first visit to Blue Bottle, my close foodie friend introduced me to drip coffee and encouraged me not to add in the syrups and creams and really appreciate the true flavors of the drink. I was shocked, mind you that my previous coffee go-tos were always the sweet flavored drinks from Starbucks. Funny how your taste buds can change overtime... Trying out Blue Bottle elevated my spectrum of coffee, but then again, maybe just being in the Bay Area does that to you anyways. It's true, SF peeps are coffee snobs and like their good coffee! Blue Bottle has always been consistent with quality and taste. Their flavors are really strong so I always love getting a latte to add in the creaminess from the milk. I also adore their HOUSE MADE LIEGE WAFFLES. 5/5 stars for sure. They are hot off the press, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, with just a touch of sweet caramelized sugar goodness. This location itself is great. Tall ceilings. Spacious seating. But beware the line can get pretty long in the mornings.

Although they've made the lines faster and more efficient since my first stop here 6 years ago. Limited seating and always packed.

"Addicted! I came here once before last year, ordered a latte and enjoyed it- wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Came back here last weekend on a cold and rainy day with the hubs- I insisted it is a great spot per reviews, and I shared my personal past experience was pleasant.The staff is a little intimidating, but we went forward and placed our orders. He ordered the Bhakti chai and I am almond milk latte. Much to my surprise, when we received our orders I somehow had an almond milk Bhakti chai- and it was the BEST mistaken order! The chai was creamy, slightly spicy and perfectly sweet! We loved it so much, we made a second stop that evening for a second round.The taste of that chai lingered with me all week, so I made my way down again, this time, per recommendation, ordering the pirate matcha chai. This was definitely more spice. The chai was overpowered by the matcha, but it worked well as I walked home through the cold. Would I order it again? Probably not- I'll stick to the Bhakti chai :)Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!",4.0 star rating
"Coffee takes way too long and is not good enough for the price. To add to it, the staff is rude to customers. For a $6 cup of small coffee, one would expect some kind of decency. Asking questions or trying to figure out how to pay when their register isn't working is met with hostility from the staff.When their management is informed of the problems with their staff, they respond just as rudely, if not worse. They insist the problem is with the customers, not their staff, seriously, what the fuck?Save your time and money and go anywhere else, their coffee isn't worth it.",1.0 star rating
"I found Contraband just before going to brunch with my date. DRINKSBhakti chai 3.5/5 The chai was very spiced and sweet but it came out just slightly warm. I really wish it came out hotter for me to enjoy. It tasted mostly like warm milk with spices on top. AMBIANCE&SERVICEDespite the cool hipster vibe of the coffee shop, the workers seemed so uninterested and intimidating. No welcome, no ""hi""s, just waiting to take your order. The cashier took our order, said ""That'll be $9"". I handed him a $50 bill, he dismisses me, turns around casually talking to his coworkers for a few minutes, took a group shot (of espresso maybe?), finally turned around and took the $50 bill from my hand. He returns my change with $10. I corrected him to say ""Oh, I gave you a $50 bill."" He returns the correct amount of change with no sincerity and a nice classic eyeroll. The interior has one large community table with limited amount of energy outlets. The music was obnoxiously loud- hard to have a normal conversation or study. The chai tea was just okay- nothing I would come back for. Prices seem pricey for the amount you get. Highly recommend this place getting new workers that like working with people.

"Super hipster coffee spot with lots of natural light. It's small, but there is enough seating for about 25ish people so the space is pretty functional. I liked the display of pastries and unique offerings such as a spiced matcha and a turmeric latte ""golden milk"". I tried the steeply 6$ golden milk, spicy and creamy at the same time. 4 stars for free WiFi but I saw only one outlet?? Wtf. Get an extender maybe?Oh, and most of the seating is elevated so it's sort of a diy standing desk if you so choose!",4.0 star rating
"There are only TWO OUTLETS HERE in the whole place hence only three stars. Other than that it'd be a great place to do work out of. Cozy coffee shop with good service and lots of natural light. It's small so it fills up quickly. I tried the rosemary and sage latte drink and guava piloto pastry and both were very good. The rosemary and sage were an interesting mix that surprisingly worked. The pastry was warm and crumbly. Overall I won't really come back because I like doing work out of coffee shops and even though I like the small outdoors seating, the lighting inside, the fancy coffee machine, and some of the plants, the lack out outlets and large communal table just really turn me off from Contraband.",3.0 star rating
"Cute coffee spot that is quiet and clean. A little sterile and lacking personality though. GF and I came here for a tea date. Baristas were nice. We both had the Bhakti chai tea latte.

"Went here with my family to grab coffee after having brunch next door at Mymy which was also an amazing brunch place. I ordered a regular coffee because I was a little nervous to go outside of my comfort zone when it comes to coffee. I explained all this to the guy who was at the front counter and he was super nice about everything and answering all my basic coffee question.  For my coffee being a regular one, it was so good. It tasted very smooth and now I want to go back and try everything else on their menu! They had succulents all across the long table in their coffee shop and a really cool art wall behind it. It's very cozy inside and not too loud so people can even come here and easily get some work done if they needed too! Will definitely be coming back!",4.0 star rating
First time coming in with high expectation because every time I passed by Contaband it was packed with people. I ordered a pirates spicy green chai which is a very ordinary green latte.  The milk foam was cold and it took up to 1/4 of the cup which it not as worth it for a latte like this. There were two small tables and the rest are high chairs. It is not a preferred place to work because the seats make me very uncomfortable.  The staffs are friendly here. Maybe I will give a second try next time.,3.0 star rating
"This coffee shop was a short walk from the Nob Hill Hotel where we were staying for a few days. The lattes we ordered on our first visit were quite well made by Brett the barista and tasted very nice. The shop has wi-fi, very long bar height community tables, plenty of power outlets, some trendy art for sale on the walls, a clean his  / hers bathroom and some outdoor seating. I came by here every morning for a latte or cappuccino and every time irritating country & western music was being played. The male staff we encountered were a drull lot and couldn't crack a smile if their life depended on it. I usually didn't stick around long as I didn't like the nerdish vibe. There was a bare minimum of food for sale but they knew how to make nice coffees, that's it ! We had breakfast most mornings at Mymy cafe right next door...the food there is excellent !",4.0 star rating
"They have free WiFi!! I literally couldn't find free WiFi anywhere else in the surrounding blocks. Thanks for coming in clutch friends. The man that took my order was really nice! Super informative on all the pastries and coffee. I got an iced latte which was good but it came in a rocks glass, like the little glasses used for cocktails. For the price I was blown away that it didn't come in a pint glass. The little snack I got was a black bean empanada, filled with good spices and had a really great crust! There is seating outside, which I opted for. Inside was filled with tall counter/tall table seating and your girl is little! Be careful sitting out there, it is SF the weather will change and you might not be able to sneak back inside! The WiFi was really fast, and it was a packed house!",4.0 star rating
"A coffee shop that actually open late in this part of SF as we where planning to go to Philz, but it was closed around 6pm. Got myself a latte, the other two got some double shot of something and a mocha latte. It was good, but it wasn't great. The coffee could be a little more hot. Overall, decent place that you can hang out since most of the mainstream coffee shop was closed around 5-6pm.",3.0 star rating
"Hidden gem!Met a friend here this evening and was so pleasantly surprised, what a great vibe! Friday evening and its full of people working on having coffee with dates/friends.

The mugs are surprisingly chic too, very photo friendly, but I did not get a photo.Will return!",5.0 star rating
"I used to go here all the time - I won't anymore. For my $5.50 latte, I asked for a splash of extra almond milk - and the other day I was received with a gruff ""so that'll be the same price as a large"" - mind you, the large that comes with two extra shots  + extra milk. I was shocked - I was charged $7+ dollars, and it was literally just a splash, and had never been a problem before. The man (gruff, stocky one with white beard) person working, who I assumed to be the manager, made a comment about emailing the staff to make sure it was never done again - and they lost a loyal customer in doing so. Also, if you get a drip coffee...half the time they don't fill it up and you're left with a huge gap. $5+ bucks for a drip coffee and not filled up? Thank you, next.Shame when mice nuts are turned into a mountain.Side note: The vibe is off, (although there are some rare, kimchi & dog loving exceptions whom I have made wonderful conversation with.) I would say half the time I go there, no one cracks a smile. Guess positivity is not returned often here. Save yourself a .75 cent almond milk fee & go elsewhere - hopefully they give a damn about their customers & their coffee is delicious.",1.0 star rating

"VEGAN OPTIONS - Yes. Soy or Almond milk.  I ordered the sage rosemary cappuccino with almond milk. The consistency of texture on the drink was just ok. Not the best, but certainly not the worst considering it was made with almond milk. However the sage rosemary syrup is very potent, and there was way too much in my drink. This made the whole cappuccino taste bitter and unbalanced, since it completely overwhelmed the coffee flavour, and honestly isn't a great pairing. I've had these kinds of herbaceous additions at other coffee spots that were done much better, and provided a subtle enhancement as opposed to a palette blaster like this was. Also, the service left a bit to be desired. Overall not impressed and I would not return in the future.",3.0 star rating

"This Philz coffee is located in the cute quiet neighborhood of Noe Valley. I came in on a weekday and ordered the Gingersnap coffee, it was my first time in.

"Main differences between this Philz and the other ones is that 1) extremely family friendly with a play corner for children, 2) street parking isn't too bad, and 3) tends to be semi-full (most likely because it's family friendly and not bring your laptop and work)Service and drinks are the same as other Philz locations. I usually come here if I'm going to just talk and hang out with a friend or two. I tried once coming with the intention to work but the children friendly corner was too much of a distraction for me.",4.0 star rating
"Stopped in a few times for a break in the afternoon, it is busy but plenty of seating even during the lunch rush, love their toasts, though this location does not currently offer the cinnamon sugar toast which is my fave. I liked the set up of this location, since the space is long and narrow there is a ton of seating (and variety of seating types) along the wall facing the bar, and this makes it welcoming to singles jus wanting to get off their feet and sip a coffee for a minute, or two people could also find tables and two-toppers to sit together comfortably. Noice level is quite high I think due to the narrow space and popularity of this location. Staff is courteous, I called in a few times to clarify hours and ask what they had on the pastry menu and everyone I spoke to was polite and positive.",5.0 star rating
"This is a solid neighborhood-oriented Philz outlet that serves the same large variety of yummy coffee drinks as other busier outlets. The coffee here is of the pour-over variety, which takes a while especially during busy periods, but at least you know that your order has been custom-made for yours truly.Folks who gripe about how long it takes to get an order fulfilled are missing the point: good coffee shouldn't be rushed. If you want something fast, go to 7-Eleven or a humdrum convenience store and see for yourself how the quality suffers.",4.0 star rating
"You need coffee?  They make it pretty good here.  They also have a few breakfast items in the bakery case.  Pick a barista and s/he will help you out!The register is by the door, so to get in line, you need to walk down to the end of the shop.  This location has tables and seating if you want to get some work done.  There is also a restroom in the back.  Parking is limited to free street spots.  They don't have a parking lot, so I see a lot of people walk or bike here.",4.0 star rating
"What I like:- their coffee. Always gives me enough caffeine to do my work What could be improved (only applies when I stay to do my work/hang out):- loud music with strong bass. Not great for someone trying to focus on her work. - not enough chairs/tables for the amount of customers that come to do their work. So I would say there's enough seats for 20 people max.

"We were staying at an AirBnB nearby and I was so excited when I found out that a Philz coffee was only 2 blocks away. I first tried Philz about 5 years ago and was blown away by the Mint Mojito, so I vowed to return when I came back to San Francisco.Now that Philz has expanded in this city and beyond, and I am happy to see that the integrity of their coffee has been preserved. I wanted to try something different so I selected Jacob's Wonderbar, and it did not disappoint. The barista takes your order and brews your coffee fresh from their selection of beans. You can also ask them to add cream and/or sugar.My coffee came up pipping hot, and it was pure coffee ecstasy. It was exactly as described: flavors of dark chocolate, smoke, and nuts. If I had a Philz around the corner from my house, I would be there everyday. Luckily, they are opening one in San Diego that is not too far from me.",5.0 star rating

When I asked if they could change it to ice, they made a remark that I was never told them that and that I asked for hot. The employees need an attitude change here.",2.0 star rating
"A great neighborhood spot for coffee. It's got a good feel to it. Whenever in the area, Philz is my go to spot for a morning coffee.  The staff is nice and the coffee is good and strong.  It's a place where you could catch up with neighbors and just read or work.  On a Friday morning I saw a number of parents gearing their kids up for school with a coffee and a toast.  There's a kids reading area as well that my daughter's enjoyed as I enjoyed a very drinkable cup of coffee.  I had a dark roast and the kindly staff asked about the sweetness and cream level.  Sweet and creamy was my choice and it was just as I envisioned.  I really like how the temperature of the coffee is instantly drinkable since why would anyone want to burn their mouth drinking boiling coffee?  Philz gets it on coffee.

"This is a great local Philz coffee in the Noe Valley area. It's kind of far out from any major public transit stops or big destinations, so it's less crowded and not as much of a wait compared to say, Philz Castro or any of the downtown ones. There's still quite a few people who come to hang out and work, though I've never had a problem finding seating. Same great flavor Philz roasts - my favs are Jacob's Wonderbar or Philtered Soul. On more than one time, I did get a weakly brewed batch that wasn't per usual Philz potency so knocking off one for the inconsistency.",4.0 star rating
"Okay what the heck... Philz does not take cash. I won't be back just for this reason. There are other great (better and more inclusive) places to get a good cup of coffee. Not taking cash automatically excludes people who want coffee but don't have a card or phone app attached to a card. It's discriminatory. No Philz, EVERYONE DOES NOT use plastic or the cloud for every tiny purchase. Kids, especially teens, poor people, undocumented people, minimalist people, people who live paycheck to paycheck, elderly people, homeless people... basically anyone who lives a life cash ONLY. This sucks",3.0 star rating
Introduced to the mint iced mojito coffee. So happy I was. It is so good! The minty fresh flavor brewed fresh once order was definitely an eye opening event.

The need to explore the coffee world is now upon me :),5.0 star rating
"Very cool little location with lots of coffee options! Most are pour over which takes a little more time, but definitely worth it! They do have a ""mobile order"" section for those who wish to call in early and just pick up their items. In addition to an extensive and epically curated coffee selection, they have a equally long list of pastry items as well. Be careful with the parking situation as there are very few spots open, and there are signs that warn against double parking and parking in red zones as you will be towed..",5.0 star rating
"I love Philz but this 1 star review is just for this location. They are SOOOO incredibly slow. I have given them the benefit of the doubt by coming at times when they were busy and not - yet somehow regardless of how many people are in there, it takes them close to 20 minutes to toast a bagel and put some cream cheese on it. SMH. They have also messed up my food order multiple times which I let go and don't bother getting it fixed bc they'll probably take too long. Honestly go down a block to 24th and diamond and eat at diamond cafe. Their food is excellent and comes out super fast. FYI - Philz on order ahead app doesn't have all their food options listed.",1.0 star rating

That alone should be 5-star-worthy, because he is very hard to please :-) Nice bonus point: It's right next to the Castro Theater and they were nice enough to let us bring our hot beverages into the cinema (because we are adults and can be trusted with handling our coffee and tea around velvet chairs)!",5.0 star rating
"I've never gotten coffee here. Unbelievable, I know. After all, I've bought the chocolate-dipped appendage on a stick that I lustfully yet respectfully dubbed Mandingo at Hot Cookie, wolfed down the overaccessorized wieners at Dapper Dog, and attended the most essential sing-alongs at the Castro Theater. Besides, I'm a Philz guy who becomes a creature of redundant habits. But I had never been here until I found myself in the Castro early on a weekday morning with a few minutes to spare before a medical appointment up the street.What deterred me is the claustrophobic space and the number of tourists and regulars who venture in but don't seem to come out. On this particular morning, it was almost empty which allowed me to get a pleasing 20-ounce cup of the Hawaiian Royal Kona coffee for just $2.15 (photo: bit.ly/2PJ1Nsg). It gave me a gulp of the tropics before my EKG and motivated me to come back to buy a bag of their beans. They spotlighted at least five different types that morning which I presume they rotate. I was just thinking how good a cup of the Geisha Esmeralda would go with a Mandingo.COFFEE - 4 stars...smooth richness with a different flavorAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...still feels tight in here but I can bear it nowSERVICE - 4 stars...awfully nice considering how long they must be in there every dayTOTAL - 4 stars...indie coffee that worked for meRELATED - Hanging around in the Castro?

Secondly, the place is very cluttered. It doesn't appear to be very organized and is a bit messy, however, the food and drink that can be purchased at Castro Coffee Company still do hit the taste buds in a positive way. There weren't as many tea options as I had expected, but nonetheless, if you don't care about anything else in this review, they make a good cup o' joe.",3.0 star rating
"I was just walking down Castro and WHAM! The aroma of coffee smacked me right in the face! I couldn't resist a hot cuppa joe on this chilly night. So I popped into this cute tiny coffee shop jam packed with coffees and pastries. The guys that attended me were friendly and polite. I had a drip coffee ($1.62) and an apricot bar ($3.25). For drip coffee, it's self serve by the door with 8 to choose from. Refills are like a buck twenty five. Unfortunately, I didn't like anything I bought here. The coffee tasted artificial AF. (Bourbon Pecan is the one I chose). And the Apricot Bar was awful; too dense, not at all sweet...like whatsoever, tasted only of dried apricots and nothing else. Canned sodas are $1 ...so that's good cuz I was thirs tyy",2.0 star rating

The shop has a lot to offer, many different types of coffees, syrups, beans, and pastries. I love their blended drinks. Tried a hot mocha once and have tried their pastries a couple times, they were good. I like how they have a little bit of seating outside. It is good to able to sit down and eat your pastry quickly especially if it is sunny. On my last trip to San Fran the smoke was making me so sick it was a blessing to be able to sit down for a bit.

"I'm not a coffee gourmet, but I'm always giving them as gifts.  I didn't want to buy stale old gourmet coffee for high prices at safeway, so I came here asking for strong but great tasting coffee and the owners were very helpful & knowledgeable- their coffee choice even impressed me along with their spinach cheese empanada!!! Their shop is tiny with only 3 small tables outside so intend to buy your coffee and pastries to drink as TAKEOUT.  But once you know the coffee you like - mine was the Barbary Coast Reserve 1 pound ground for $12- then you can just go in and out and enjoy it at home or work!!  They also have their website you can google where you can order the coffee to be shipped to you if you already know what you want so no having to leave home!!I'd definitely come back!!",5.0 star rating

I love that there's a huge selection of coffee pumps and that they change daily so you can really sample all the wonderful variety of roasts and blends this place carries. I personally prefer a medium or light roast so I get more caffeine to balance my heavy cream. There's always at least two choices, one Latin American and one usually African.

"This is a super awesome coffee walk up right on the main drag of the Castro.Parking is street only, which in the mornings and on weekends is very possible, however San Francisco overall has heavy traffic, limited parking and an excellent public transportation system. So if it's a weekday, or  weekend evening consider getting here some way that does not involve driving or be prepared for a quarter mile park and walk. If it helps there is both a muni station and the a street car stop not quite a block away.There are three or so patio style metal table/chair combos outside if you feel like having your coffee on site, but there is no inside seating and overall this is more of a walk in/walk out kinda place.Decor is what I'd describe as San Francisco utilitarian. The building itself has been here forever (it used to be the Castro Cheesery-but even under that name it was till a coffee place.) and has that settled well used look. The counter is dominated by every kind of coffee the world has to offer in bulk glass displays. While there is also an extensive selection of teas to chose from there are more then a hundred different types of coffee bean in stock. That's all pretty awesome but there's more. The baristas on deck have some mad coffee skills. This is easily one of the best espresso spots anywhere. The manager (who may also be the owner) on scene is turkish and well, he's forgotten more about what makes a great pull then most mortals ever know. If espresso is not your thing this place also puts out godlike latte's  cappuccinos and the like. As you might expect there is nothing wrong with the basic coffee's either and at 2.50 for a meduim-ish it's the total bargain choice.But wait there's yet more awesome goodness here-the pastry counter. When you get up to the cashier section to pay for your drink and some beans (Hey, you're in line anyway. Why not?) there is amazingly tempting treats in a display case. If you need something more breakfasty then the mouth pleasing petit fours/truffles/things covered with sugar and oozing cream/almond paste/marzipan/whatever the croissants are the way to go as the bagels and burritos are just ordinary. Not bad mind you, but not anything to come just for either. Avoid the malt balls though-nobody orders those really and the ones on display have been there a while.So while this is not the best spot to break out the laptop and pretend to work while secretly checking everyone out, this is one of the best high quality, local, quirky coffee spots in a city filled with excellent quirky coffee spots.",5.0 star rating
"No over the top here fancy words here, just a great cup of joe that comes at a great price compared to other coffee shops in Castro.  The shop is so small, but they've got your standard drinks.  They also sell coffee beans too if you need some for home.  I ended up with a latte which tasted great, no sugar necessary and not too bitter.  Great stuff.",5.0 star rating
"Exceptionally good coffee, exceptional price. Many whole bean options (I grind fresh at home each day), and REAL authentic light roasts. If you are a real fan of light only, you know how medium is often passed off as light. These beans here are visible and on display when you choose. Most prices are in the low to mid teens per pound, for a real, actual 16 ounce pound. Whereas other high end roasts are 10-12 ounces, and are priced anywhere from $16 to over $20....If you have a cup of brew from the store, it is not an individual pour over made for you, it's from a pump canister. THAT SAID (because you know this could be not so great, in all reality), yesterday I went in for the 1st time ever, at 3:30 pm, when you'd *expect* that to be less than fresh. I pumped out the VERY LAST cup and it absolutely tasted just minutes old. REALLY GREAT COFFEE. Meaning that, at that late hour, they obviously turn over the product too fast for it to sit long. Also, that cup of amazing coffee was only $1.65 for a small.EXTREME BONUS: among the cream options is heavy cream. I can't really do coffee with half and half-it's just not the same. So really, in a nutshell, I found here all of the things I've never ever managed to find anywhere. Can't imagine myself ever going anywhere else now.",5.0 star rating
"While I am not a coffee connoisseur by any definition, I know when I need caffeine and when I stumbled upon the Castro Coffee Company, I knew what I needed. Lo and behold I was pleasantly surprised to find a pretty incredible cup of coffee awaiting me, good service, and some pretty darn good pastries as well.The shop is small, but the limited seating outside is pretty nice to catch up with a friend on a nice day (which it was). You come here for coffee and it is pretty evident once you set in. For some reason, a hand made cup of coffee caught my eye and unbeknownst to me, you have to pick the coffee to use. Say what!? I don't know where to begin with this...The gentleman behind the counter quickly sensed my confusion and shock and began to ask me what I liked and enjoyed and proceeded to make a recommendation which didn't fail. It was one of the best cups of coffee I ever had. No need for milk or sugar. Just one of the best cups.There is a small selection of pastries and while they weren't the most amazing bites I ever had, but it doesn't disappoint.Prices are pretty reasonable and in my short time at the shop, it seems to be that quick grab and go spot that the locals hit up to grab their coffee before making their way on their daily routines.Would I go back? Sure. It was one of the best cups I ever had.",4.0 star rating

"I've walked by this place many times and never walked in until today, and I'm really glad I did! I walked in on a whim and was immediately greeted by the friendly baristas behind the counter, the immediate service was really nice too!I ordered the Jasmine Oolong Tea For Here and it came out a few minutes after I ordered in a cute tea cup with a little pitcher of the rest of my hot tea. The set up was so cute and it only cost $5! Their big windows are perfect to enjoy the late afternoon sun. There is a little sugar station where you can add what you want to your tea and coffee, but when it comes to my hot tea I like it just the way it is! The little blue seating area that doesn't have any booths or set tables has a very cute community vibe to it and I enjoyed sitting there just enjoying the sun with others",4.0 star rating
"I'm a huge fan of Verve Coffee in Santa Cruz. Unfortunately, this location isn't at all the style I liked at the original location. First, seating is limited, and you can't lean backwards on any of the cushions near the windows without stressing your back. Second, some of the pricing is misleading. Santa Cruz offers you different prices for different sizes but here, the menu at the counter only displays one price for certain items--the larger and more costly size. I'm sorry to say I won't be returning and will instead drive to Santa Cruz. (April 2019)",2.0 star rating
"Ahhhh the epitome of the hipster cafe with minimal space where you're forced to either uncomfortably stand with a sliver of table to work or cuddle with the stranger next to you as you share the only table in the entire space. My favorite! Other than that, love the vibe haha. But really there's not a lot of space and you really have to wait for a spot or just idk leave? I didn't try their coffee as I was all caffeinated for the day. I definitely will be back though! I love this area and it's right near Dolores Park. I would just recommend you come early to snag a spot or come superrrr late like when they're closing lol.OK UPDATE: I totally lovedddd spending my afternoon here. I applied to what seemed like all the jobs listed in the Bay Area and read Michelle Obama's new book! A+! The place starts to clear out around 5pm so if you're looking for a spot then without waiting, that'd be the time!",4.0 star rating
"Great place located at the corner of Market and Church. I love the big windows, wooden panels, plants, bright, and cozy feel of the space. They have free WiFi and tables  for you to read and do work.  The coffee and service is great, of course. There is also a bathroom for what happens after drinking coffee ;)I had a cappuccino with hemp milk (they don't have oat milk here), and my boyfriend had the one&one which is basically a machiatto with an extra shot of espresso. Will definitely be back.",5.0 star rating
"Love this place for doing work, reading a book or just catching up with friends. First off, it's one of the few places that has oat milk as the option. Second, their food options are great! I had the biscuit with a poached egg and my friend got the avocado toast, and both tasted amazing. Pro tip: grab a corner seat and curl up on a rainy day!",5.0 star rating
"I'm not a coffee drinker at all, but needed something to wake me up on my morning walk. The space is aesthetically pleasing with a lot of natural light, which freshens up the setting. They have plenty of plants instilled around the sleek countertops --very neat space and design. I just had a cup of Chai with Almond Milk ($4.25) to-go and was on my way.This isn't the best place to study or work though as there isn't too much space though. On the other hand, great to people watching as it's situated on a corner with floor to ceiling glass windows all around.",3.0 star rating
"A cozy little coffee shop to get some work done! We came here on Black Friday after hopelessly calling a bunch of coffee shops in SF looking for something that's open. It is a small spot close to Whole Foods/Safeway on Market. You can either sit at a table or one of the couches (tables were taken when we came at ~ 10:30 am). They have both WiFi and an xfinity hotspot so you're covered! I haven't seen any outlasts though :/The design is a combination of old brick and wood. It reminds me of New England more than anything. I love the amount of natural light offered by huge windows. Definitely bringing a book next time!We got a latte, a chai, and two cookies. The drinks were good quality even though a little pricey. I found the chocolate cookie a bit overwhelming, but the poppyseed one was great! The avocado toast ($9) was actually very delicious and bigger than what you'd get for the price at most places. Overall, the ambiance is what really seals the deal for Verve. It's perfect to work or read a book on a rainy day!",5.0 star rating
"Verve Coffee Roasters is a small, minimal space that offers your typical coffee options as well as some nice light food choices. My boyfriend and I stopped here one morning during our visit to SF to fuel up for the day. I ordered a latte and a piece of quiche, and he got a pour over and the daily toast, which had ricotta and plenty of greens. The guy at the counter was super friendly, helpful, and patient, which was refreshing as I find sometimes the customer service at places like this can be lacking. The pour over came with a little card that includes the variety's flavor profile notes, cup characteristics, producer, region, process, and cultivar. I'm not a coffee snob by any means but I still thought this was cool. The latte was your typical latte, creamy and delicious. My personal favorite part of our visit was the quiche. When I ordered, I was informed that the slices are served at room temp and asked if that was okay, which I really appreciated. The quiche was so intensely creamy and rich that it almost felt more like a dessert, which sounds weird but it was packed with flavor from the salty bacon and so decadent. Definitely not an every day option for me but a nice vacation treat. The daily toast was just okay, not a whole lot of flavor and I thought it could have used more seasoning. Overall I enjoyed our stop at Verve and would go back in the future, or if I lived nearby.",4.0 star rating

"I have walked by Verve Coffee many times. I decided to visit today and try something. It's a different cafe with its own concept. It's minimal, but there's some different coffee drinks. I saw Americano and espresso, and that didn't appeal to me. I saw something called ""One and One"" and thought I would try it. It was an espresso shot and a macchiato shot. The macchiato shot was creamy and a small shot of coffee. The espresso was very sour and you had to drink it fast. This cafe is modern and comfortable to hang out in. Compare it to Philz, which gets on my nerves. My drink was $4. I wonder if I will be caffeinated for the rest of the day.",4.0 star rating

"Verve is my favorite coffee ""chain"" for espresso based drinks. I was so excited that they opened shop in SF after having only been able to have it through third party shops and when I visit LA. The space is gorgeous (convenient to get to via public transport) and the drinks were solid. Price is typical for California. It was also super busy when I visited so not much space and there was never not a line at the register. Note, this location is NOT idea for studying/working for the many reasons below:No accessible outlets throughout - just in one locationSeating is very very sparse throughout the day but very cozy corners in the back and plenty of standing spotsFree wifi but how will you use it when you can't really sit anywhere?Baristas are friendly but when I went, getting a cup of water after the initial order was hard (not sure if they usually have a water station)-1 star for the store itself - I wish they were much much bigger with much more space to even sit down and chat with a friend - but a full 5 for the drinks :)",4.0 star rating
"If I'm not mistaken - and I often am - this is Verve's only retail presence in the city, and it's a prominent spot at the much traversed corner of Market and Church. Most of their cafes are in Santa Cruz, where co-founders Ryan O'Donovan and Colby Barr base their operations, and Tokyo of all places, where I think I saw one of their cafes in Shinjuku. In other words, they may be Blue Bottling toward Starbucks territory but there was no evidence of racial profiling yet at the Castro location. Just more of a preference for them to serve the local hipster populace from what I could tell from their droning chatter.I suppose I should have gone for one of their coffee specialties since they appeared to have all the shiny hardware necessary to prepare them (photo: bit.ly/2JkpKSO). However, I was in the mood for tea on a blustery day when I was a bit on the forlorn side. I went for a $4 cup of their Rooibos which was advertised as having elements of caramel and nectar and being 'bodied' whatever that means. I waited patiently for the barista to prepare it from a jar of loose leaves, and the result was smooth and, well, 'bodied' (photo: bit.ly/2Hl167X). There is seating in here, but good luck with that as the laptoppers lay siege to the space. In response, I was off on my merry way.TEA - 4 stars...a particularly smooth Rooibos can be sipped hereAMBIANCE - 3 stars...ah, to be young and self-entitledSERVICE - 3 stars...tersely pleasantTOTAL - 4 stars...probably helps to express some nerve at Verve",4.0 star rating
"I consistently have a great experience here. The service is outstanding. Friendly yet unpretentious. The vibe is local with a mix of friends meeting friends, first dates, people working, and people getting a quick drink. It's also a great place to people watch.

The menu is small, but has some great healthy options.",5.0 star rating
"Was ok drinking my coffee when suddenly a frigid strong cold draft starts blowing on me and does not stop. I asked an employee to turn it off or do something since its 8am and why any SF restaurant would need AC on?!

"Decent lattes. Had a new barista working on our drinks. 3 of 4 lattes were overflowing the cup. Although the coffee actually tasted good, there was no need to over-pour 3 of 4 drinks.

"Verve has been one of my favorite coffee experiences on my latest trip to SF.The aesthetic of the cafe includes large windows on most sides and awesome use of lines, light wood, and touches of teal. Love the pop of color. Simple and effective. The counter is long and gives the coffee a front-and-center placement. Not a crazy amount of seating but does include a small communal table and benches and low tables, allowing the coffee culture to shine. It's really a unique space.I went for a Gibraltar, which is espresso plus a splash of warm milk. (It's like a mini latte!) A bit pricey but definitely satisfying and delicious. The barista offered to add more milk orvchange the temperature of milk if we wanted. Not sure how he would have done the latter, but he obviously cares a about a customized cup.There is a small but ample selection of sweet and savory carby foods. The open-face sandwiches, in particular, looked very pretty and tasty.",4.0 star rating

"Eh......Cute place with fun decor and soothing music.   Ordered one of their german cheese plates.   It was good, but it was $12 for a pretzel, three small pieces of cheese and 6 cold cuts.   I ate there 2 hours ago and I am already scrounging my kitchen for something else to eat.   I guess this place would be good if you wanted to meet a couple of people for koffee klatch, but, for me, this place is neither here nor there.   Like, if you are feeling slightly (and I mean SLIGHTLY) peckish AND are feeling like you don't want to commit to any one thing and just pick at something, then this is the place for you.Side note:   I feel like this place is a total missed opportunity.   It's a block from Dolores Park, and literally nothing on the menu except for maybe a pastry is easily transportable.   If there was a sandwich or two on the menu, think about all the take away business this place could do with everyone headed to the park and all.   I can't believe more local businesses haven't capitalized on this.   It's truly befuddling.The Castro is in desperate need for good lunch places, and, sadly, this place misses the mark for me.  What I ate was technically good, but it wasn't a meal, and, from the looks of the menu, it didn't look like there were any actual meals at all.",3.0 star rating
"Unfortunately, updating my 5 star to 3. My third visit here and I brought my husband to grab a coffee and do a little work/reading. I was pretty excited to come back and show him this cute spot, but unfortunately had a ""lesser quality"" of an experience than before. The woman who took our order today had zero patience with us and zero warmth, which was odd because we just got to the counter. We couldn't tell if she was giving us sass or just naturally rough around the edges, but every interaction with her felt like we were inconveniencing her day despite it not being busy.She seemed annoyed when I wanted to clarify the price of our two coffees, then forgot to give us one coffee so I had to ask her male co-worker. She yelled for us to get the second coffee at the counter when I noticed her co-worker dropped off food and beverages he took orders for to tables. When my husband asked for the wifi he didn't quite hear right and went back and she coldly said ""It's right here. Look at it."" and walked away to the back. On top of that, I couldn't help but note she never asked if we wanted our order to go or not, and she didn't ask if I wanted my pastry heated up like I got last time I was there (which I loved!). We got our coffees in to go cups and my pastry in a bag automatically. Everyone else at tables had lovely ceramics--perhaps she subconsciously wanted us to go from the beginning. :]",3.0 star rating
"I have found my favorite coffee shop in San Fransisco! Situated next to Dolores Park, this is such a delightful German inspired coffee shop and just sitting it reminded me of the amazing times I had in Berlin. There is just such good energy in this coffee shop, Aesthetics very crisp and welcoming, the service is amazing, and the coffee is so wonderful especially on a nice sunny day. A lot of their pastries are pastries you would not find typically in America. I had one of their soft boiled eggs with muesli and it was very delightful. It's also very quiet inside and you can do a lot of work inside if you need to. I just love all of the German decorations as well. There's something so nostalgic about this coffee shop and if you are in San Francisco, I highly highly recommend eating here. The next time I come, I want to try some of their German dishes. I've attached some photos of this place because it was so beautiful. They really did a great job creating this Cafe, a treasure near Dolores Park.",5.0 star rating

Who would have thought the corner of Church and 17th needed another cafe? But Mauerpark is a surprisingly welcome addition. I spent a peaceful rainy morning here watching the trains go by.

I hope Mauerpark and Morning Due continue to coexist happily for many years on either side of MUNI tracks.Tschuss!,5.0 star rating

"Have been here twice, both times were perfect. First we had beers and a pretzel roll--yummerz. Besides excellent beer in appro glassware, the ambiance was like we were in a time-space warp: the architecture is straight up 50s, there was a large group of friendly people speaking in German, and the service was so thoughtful and friendly--it's a breathe of fresh air from the frantic, hurried, entitled city pace.We came for brunch the next time and enjoyed three different boards. Mine had muesli and yogurt with cheeses, fruits, bread, and accompaniments. I added a soft boiled egg (where else can you get that treat) in the adorable egg cup. See pic. Everything was perfect. I tried a German coffee which was a delicious dessert treat. We're so glad Salome is here and can't wait to come back.

I arrived just around 8:30a, and since it's near the schools, I was sure it would be packed and I'd find no parking. I was pleasantly surprised to find a spot out front, and a not so busy restaurant inside. I ordered the original ""Jacob"", which I really loved. The service was pleasant, and they also ground up a 1/2 pound of that same roast for me to-go. It's much better than what I had been pouring at my house.

"Philz is definitely the spot to get caffeinated and to start or recharge your day! Whether you're a student, remote employee or just an overall coffee fiend this Ocean Avenue location may just be a new part of your daily routine. The ambiance is really great here. It just makes you want to be studious. An ample amount of seating and comfy chairs that look like they were made to be put into a coffee shop set the tone of this Philz. There's lot of natural light shining through (when it's not too foggy here hehe), but Yelper be warned that even though there is a good amount of seating - seats are likely to be taken quickly! Doable, but also keep your eyes peeled.As always, coffee here is also reliable. If you want something refreshing I'd definitely go for the mint mojito! I know this is basic and really a popular choice of many but seriously it's so good. Unless you don't like mint, then maybe just get a regular coffee jk. But seriously, I love their iced drinks when I need more energy. A few friends also ordered teas here and said they enjoyed their drinks as well.Amazing and quick  customer service!

"I've had multiple bad experiences at this Philz and others. I don't know if it's stigmas against me, or that Philz has really gone downhill over the years, or Philz employees are just snooty, entitled hipsters. Probably all the above. This is probably one of the newest Philz, in one of the most rapidly-gentrifying parts of the city. When I last went to this Philz, it seemed like 100% of their customers and employees were snooty, tattoed, extremely stylish Millenials in their 20s and younger. City College area just gets more bougie and gentrified by the day. Just a few short years ago, that area was still ghetto, cold, sparse, and uncool - what a mere community college area should be like. But with the opening of Whole Foods, and the resultant barrage of hip businesses and expensive housing - the City College area has gotten to be as snotty hipster as the rest of the city. Well. A while ago, I politely asked the cashier for a restroom code, and before I was able to finish my sentence, she angrily muttered the code - as if to slam it in my face. I get that ""cattle"" tone and subhuman treatment constantly - but it's even worse at hipster elitist places like Philz. Um, I'm more Philz than any of you - I've been to Philz ever since they opened in the mid-2000s, and to every location in SF, and I've tried all 12 of their coffees multiple times each. I'm so much more fully Philz than any of you - and you dare think I don't belong, stick out like a sore thumb, and deserve the most demeaning, contemptuous treatment?Another time I went, I was digging in my tote bag for my wallet, and the hipster cashier rudely kept tapping at the counter - even as I profusely kept apologizing for keeping her waiting - for like 30 seconds. The disgust and disdain for certain unattractive Asians like me is everywhere, and extreme, uncalled for, and absolutely unacceptable. At every table and sofa at Philz - all the snooty trendy Millenials avoided eye contact with me completely, and if they happened to see me, they gave a disgusted look and quickly looked away, like they saw the most lowly thing on earth. Remember, I started going to Philz, all their stores, enthusiastically, long before they ever had coffee in their lives. Who's more Philz - me or them?The coffee I got the last time I went was pretty bad, too - so undrinkable, I thought of throwing it out after a few sips. The only saving grace for Philz is that they do purport to hear about your complaints - though I don't know if they actually take action after hearing my complaints. I don't know if they actually try to train staff to always treat ALL customers with the same amount of warmth, fairness, and respect. It's an unwelcoming, rude place for Asians who look older and fobby - and I'm neither old nor fobby (I'm US-born) - but that's how I'm adamantly seen, treated, brutalized, and excluded.",2.0 star rating

Good location with good food selections nearby, and parking is not too bad with Whole Foods across the street and a fair amount of 2 hr street parking.

Literally always reeks of urine (probably because the toilet doesn't have any water in it at baseline, but really God knows why).

So as mentioned, I always get their mint mojito even though I pretend to think I'll try something different. It's hard not to get mint mojito whenever you're at Philz, the next best thing is to probably buy a bag of Philz coffee for home use. You order first, try your drink and let them know if it's perfect for you, then pay. Generally, I try not to make them remake my drink more than twice cause you know, don't be wasteful.

"Philz was so smart to open up this location - right across the street from City College, at the base of a brand new apartment building, and very close to a huge MUNI and BART hub. They have plenty of indoor AND outdoor seating - great place for students, WFH-ers and just passer-bys looking for a pick-me-up. If you haven't been to Philz before, here's the drill: Walk in, order at the bar with an available barista, walk over to the register to order food/pastries and pay for your drink while you wait for your drink to be ready. My usual go to is the Mint Mojito Iced Coffee (basic... I know, but it's so good) my other go to would be a Mocha Tesora which is great. I love that they've opened up this new location on Ocean Ave.",5.0 star rating
"My daughter and I asked several bystanders on the street where Ritual Coffee is in the Castro. We were so glad to find this gem!

"Stumbled upon this place after having brunch at Kitchen Story! My gf and I were super tired after the long drive from SJ to the city that we desperately needed a pick me up. We were walking around and yelped a few places and decided to go into this establishment! Ritual Coffee Roasters is a tiny little coffee shop located in the heart of Castro. It has a minimalistic feel to it which I digged - bright, open, and airy.I ordered the latte with soy milk and a chocolate chip cookie. The latte was very enjoyable! It had a nice sweetness to it, with a good amount of  covering of hot steamed milk. The chocolate chip cookie was also delightful. Perfect amount of sweetness and softness (the cookie is quite large so you can def share it with someone). A great combo! Can't wait to come back",4.0 star rating

"The first review of 2019 goes to Ritual Coffee Roasters. Ritual Coffee has like 6-7 stores in SF including their roastery. I decided to try this spot in the Castro today. I looked through the list and it was expensive. I was wishy-washy until I decided to get the ""cherry bomb."" This drink is a cold drink with ice. It has tonic water, cold brew, and maraschino cherry syrup. It was created by a barista at one the Ritual SF shops. It was alright. You stir it up. It had a cherry kick with cold coffee and ice. It was interesting and $6. I have nothing better to do than amuse myself with SF cafe creations like the ""cherry bomb."" Well, keep on inventing new drinks and people will try it.",4.0 star rating
"Cute little spot on Market Street. Great Cold brew, and a decent selection on pastries. It's just a coffee bar, so there's no lounging around here to enjoy your drinks. Like take your drink and go kind of place.  There are a few benches along the wall though. The woman working was friendly, and I was in and out. There are multiple locations. However, they're not very big yet. I hope they stay this way. Nothing worse than getting bought out by Nestle or another large corporation. I'll completely stop buying their coffee like I have with Blue Bottle.",4.0 star rating
"Yes, Ritual is one of the better coffee chains in SF. They are experts in the craft. I must say, the folks at this location are also a bit pretentious. I asked if a specific drink could be iced, and the guy pretty much scoffed at me. Cool. Generally, I found the menu a little short, and the food items weren't as enticing as other similarly-calibrated coffee shops. But I'd be happy if this was my local spot.My husband's seasonal dandelion latte, which had a special chocolate in it, was very decadent and nice. I ended up getting the daily drip, which was fruity and a good pick me up.Tiny location with a few spots to sit for a few minutes.",3.0 star rating
"If you enjoy good coffee, friendly staff and an occasional sweet treat this is the place for you. Unlike Starbucks or Philz, this is a no frills spot - no big comfy chairs, no spot to park your laptop for hours on end. For me, I see this as a plus!",5.0 star rating

"In a busy city with busy lives, it is a relief to know there's places like this location. It's conveniently across the gym I go to. It's so relaxing to sit, enjoy an espresso, and look out the window. Special shoutout to Joey, who works here most mornings. He's a story teller.

"So we all know the Castro needs a coffee shop like a fish needs a bicycle but I'm a fan of this little unassuming Ritual location.

A small coffee shop in the Castro District. This is a fairly small cafe and it is mostly for those to-go coffee drinkers. Don't expect any tables or working space here!

"Hands down the best coffee & espresso in the Castro (and IMHO in San Francisco -- I am a total coffee nerd so I've definitely done some research on the matter!) Once I started drinking Ritual coffee I could never go back to normal brewed stuff, even the espresso at most places. It's what I always brew at home now. I've literally never had a bad shot here. Macchiato is pure magic, and my standard drink (soy latte extra hot extra shot) is reliably balanced and generally mind-blowing. Even their ""brewed and ready"" drip coffee is good! I haven't tried their cold brew, but I heard it is super strong and tasty, apparently they brew it double strength for 16 hours(!) so that it doesn't get diluted when they serve it over ice. Smart.The vibe in the shop is cool too. The music is always something good. The baristas at this location are pure gold, and by that I mean they are very talented at their work, obsessive about dialing in the perfect cup, and also are just sweet, kind, and quirky people. They got hella pride -- most of the baristas are queer, they have lil rainbow and trans flags stuck in a cup of beans at the door, and their own special Ritual rainbow logo is painted on the wall and printed on t-shirts! (I bought one.) There is a big bench to sit and chat or read, but the place is just too small for tables or laptop-working. Enjoy interacting with your favorite human! Or the baristas! :) People usually come in for their coffee and then move along, so it typically looks quiet inside. For a laugh while you wait check out the postcards on the wall from their biggest ""fan""... Hilarious.10/10 recommend, the best spro in SF, don't miss out.",5.0 star rating

The light roasting with honey definitely adds a great flavor to the bean. Best place to come on a nice day and people watch.",5.0 star rating
"We've now been to our 4th location of this fabulous brand. They are all very consistent in their excellent coffee beverages from location to location. Our cortados have been perfectly made each time, made vegan with soy milk. So tasty, creamy and with perfectly roasted coffee. We plan to hit up all 7 of their locations eventually. Great brand and owned by great people that understand how to make great coffee. This location, much like the other ones always seem to be out or nearly out of vegan pastry options. There was only one lonely scone left at 10:45am this past Saturday (1/13/18). It would be very nice if there were more vegan and gluten-free options as those seem to be very popular. There were several non-vegan pastries and cookies in the case left the day we were there.",5.0 star rating

"Equator not only has high-quality coffee and matcha, but the customer service is impressive. These baristas make stellar drinks--only after listening to what it is that you really want! Let me explain... I'm on a 21 day cleanse (isn't everyone in Nor Cal?) and I'm very limited in what I can drink on this thing. I ran out of matcha at home and was craving a simple, pure, no-sugar matcha latte. Big chains make matcha lattes, but they are laden with sugar!! I was so impressed that the barista took the time to answer my ridiculous cleanse ingredient questions and made me the best matcha ever! I love love love the coffee here, but this matcha is AMAZING! I love that they make cortados, have nitro coffee and sell Underwood wine in a can. The location is perfect with plenty of seating outside if you want to buy a pastry and enjoy your drink (they sell pastries, too!). It's a great atmosphere near Fort Mason. Grab your drink and walk around the marina, go farther along the water to the Golden Gate Bridge or stay around and go to the Farmer's Market on Sunday morning.",5.0 star rating

"This is such a great addition to Fort Mason.  I typically come here on Sunday mornings either before or after the Ft. Mason Farmer's Market.  I was lucky enough to stumble in on their opening day (free coffee!) and I've yet to be disappointed.  I typically order an Americano and add the homemade cashew milk, which is delicious.  For those that care, I don't believe they offer soy or almond milk, only cashew milk.  The staff here is always friendly and generally in a good mood and service is very prompt. The space is also clean, and nicely laid out.  Overall, this is a great spot with tons of outdoor seating, though prices feel as though they're a touch higher than other third-wave coffee spots (but the cashew milk almost makes it worth it.)",5.0 star rating

Even though there were a lot of space because it's tucked in a corner, the orders came out real fast so there was virtually no wait.There is a separate ""room"" area in the back where they have seats just for Ritual customers, kind of like a ""backyard"", which is nice.The only downside is when we asked for one of their tea items on their menu, they ran out, but it happens.

"I went to Ritual when I went to check out Flora Grubb Gardens. Ritual is nestled in a corner of the nursery's store. Even tucked away like that, it seems to have a following. Considering the serene location, I imagine people find it to be a nice retreat. there is only a few bar stools in terms of seating, but you can take your coffee into the garden and sip among the succulents and other green things. I wasn't actually looking for something hot. I just wanted something refreshing.The Cherry Bomb hit the bill. It is NOT sweet. It is a fruity, refreshing jolt to the system that will wake you up and put a pep in your step. It's really pretty, too. It even comes with a cherry on top. After your of buying $5 coffee at Starbucks, I didn't bat at eye at the $6 price tag. They also have pretty good cookies too. A bought a nicely packaged bag of thumbprints for a gift. my Mom offered me one later that day,The cookies were just the right size to hold an entire mini peanut butter cup on top. They were a bit of crumbly of crumbly, buttery goodness. if you live strong coffee balance by serene settings and some good people watching try this little slice of awesomeness in Bayview.",4.0 star rating
A coffee shop located in an oasis like garden/plant shop.

"I came to this location originally because I heard this place was next to a greenhouse, garden and man, this place is awesome. The coffee store is located inside the Flora Grubb store and this location is everything :) The coffee here is similiar to any other ritual coffee roaster. I ordered the 8oz latte with 1 shot and the total came out to $3.75. I feel like the latte here is somewhat cheaper than other places because most latte's are upwards of $4-5. I like how this ritual coffee store is more than a store because it's essentially located inside a garden. Feel free to walk around the store and explore some of the plants and art pieces. I would definitely come back to this location to show my other friends around!",5.0 star rating

"A coffee shop, located in the middle of an urban plant nursery? You have to be kidding me! When we were visiting our friends in SF, they took us to Flora Grubb Gardens to shop around. Being that I didn't want to spend an arm & a leg on overpriced succulents & plants , I opted to buy a coffee & pastry at Ritual and relax on their back patio.2 iced coffees & 2 pastries roughly came to $14.00. Yes it's a bit on the pricey side, but when the coffee & pastries are both equally as good, I can't really complain. Their iced coffee is strong & sweet, while their homemade pastries are to die for. Do yourself a favor and order their homemade oreos - we easily could have eaten 5 of these. Their salted chocolate chip cookie was also decadent. This place is a hipsters, DIY-er's, coffee lovers dream. I mean, even if you don't buy anything here, enjoy sun bathing on one of their many patio chairs that are scattered throughout Flora Grubb.

"What an awesome coffee place. I'll keep this short as picture is worth a thousand word. So go see the ""pix"" here and you'll get a better understanding what I'm talking about.It was dead on perfect timing for me to visit this place as I was recovering from a hangover and I think my BFF and myself overstayed our stay like ""Goldilock"" trying their many lounge chairs (for sale) at Flora Gardens. lmao :pThe actual coffee shop itself is way in the back, way in the corner. It was cool to watch them make coffee pouring one at a time. I had the cappuccino of course and it was good. We also had their chocolate-less brownie which had a very interesting texture and taste to it. I was educated that Ritual Coffee specializes on ""Light Roast"" only. So if you are a dark roast fan, this will not work for you.If you are looking to unwind and relax and want a room with a green view, come visit Ritual Coffee at this location. There are plenty of chairs to hangout either at their coffee patio or at Flora Garden's lounge display that they have for sale! There are plenty street parking and a few private spots in front of their business.PS - they have several locations to serve you including one in Napa and I've been to the one on Valencia Street.Cheers~",4.0 star rating

It is very nice to navigate through the plants and decorations of the nursery, and you can make your way to the back where the coffee shop is.

We along with our pooch found a cute little sitting area to enjoy our coffees and with the sun shining brightly it was a perfect fall morning in SF.

There are a few tables inside and I can definitely see this place getting crowded really quickly. Try this place out and youll be happy you did!",5.0 star rating
"Seeing various Instagram posts about Urban Ritual's matcha toffee made me stop by the Hayes Valley neighborhood to try this drink. Literally. It's a decent-sized boba shop with a couple of tables and a U-shaped bench for seating. I had my eyes set on the matcha toffee and my boyfriend was curious as to what drinks he should try. I mentioned that their creme brulee is one of their popular drinks, so he decided to order it with boba. He couldn't adjust the sugar for this drink, but it was actually not too sweet. It's rich and has bits of the creme brulee pudding & caramelized sugar in it. He pointed out that the boba was a bit on the hard side, though.The matcha with oat milk is really good with 50% sweetness (75% is their default, I think). They use Jade Leaf Matcha and you can tell that the quality of the matcha is creamier than most. Unfortunately, I wish I could taste more of the toffee flavor. There was a huge clump of it on the bottom of my drink after I finished it. Maybe I should have a) stirred it more thoroughly and/or b) order with less ice? Nonetheless, Urban Ritual is a cute boba shop with unique drinks that caters to everyone and has fast service.",4.0 star rating
"I did not try their most popular drinks--the matcha toffee or the creme brulee milk tea. This is because I don't think I would be a fan of crunchy things inside of my drink, getting stuck in my teeth while I am drinking. The cashier, however, let me sample their toffee and it was delicious! It was really good on its own, with a rich, sweet flavor and soft crunchy texture. However, I still don't think I would have enjoyed it in my drink.I got the house milk tea with oat milk and the creme brulee as a topping (no hard sugar, just the custard), and it was really good! The milk tea had a strong tea flavor, which is what I always look for, and the custard inside my tea made it really rich and creamy. Their creme brulee custard is also made in house, which I really liked.It had a simple yet aesthetic interior, good for studying or 1:1 milk tea dates. I might come back and try a different drink if I am in the area, but not a place I would go out of my way for.",4.0 star rating
"They are having a promotion with the Ritual app right now, so my drink was only $1! I decided to get the creme brulee drink because I love the creme brulee dessert.

My friend got a Creme Brulee milk tea drink, which was surprisingly incredibly filling, and tasted like actual creme brulee in a milk tea cup.I wasn't incredibly impressed to be honest. I guess one of the main selling points for it is that it's probably the only boba place located here in Hayes Valley.",3.0 star rating
"Urban Ritual is probably the best place to get some quality boba. Although in San Francisco, on of my usual go to is Boba Guys, it is safe to say that Urban Ritual definitely TRUMPS Boba Guys. I'm surprised I didn't review this place a while a go but there is no doubt it gets my 5 stars in a heart beat. I don't usually go out to Hayes Valley but I do come to this boba shop specifically because my friends and I love it so much. This is like a hole in the wall boba place because I feel like not a lot of people know about it. At my most recent visit, I got the Lotus Flower Bomb.. and boy was this BOMB! This was a specialty drink (and possibly seasonal) so I'm not sure if it's going to be around. In the drink is a mixture of Grapefruit, Lotus flower, & Chrysanthemum tea. All of my favorite things in one cup! This is just such a refreshing drink, you can't go wrong with it -- especially if you like grapefruit. You know the quality of the drink is great because there are even little particles of grapefruit and I can literally see the workers grab fresh tea leaves.Boba is also a big factor of how I decide if I like a boba shop. This place is ON POINT. I've been disappointed by so many places where they just use day old boba (or that's what it tastes like) but at Urban, I can actually taste the yummy squishy boba that is really what fresh boba should taste like. Overall, quality trumps everything in my books and this place has got it! 10/10 would recommend to anyone and this place should get more attention it deserves.",5.0 star rating
"Overall 3/5:Not the best drinks you can get in SF by a long shot. Their drinks were refreshing, but the flavors weren't anything that popped. Drinks:- Matcha Toffee 2/5: Ultimately, my girlfriend and I didn't finish this drink and there were a couple reasons. We couldnt taste the toffee and matcha, which somewhat defeated the purpose of the drink. The drink basically just tasted like whole milk. - Bae-sil 4/5: Thought it was a little bit watered down, but I enjoyed this drink a lot more. The strawberry flavor is definitely the most prominent in this drink, and the basil adds a slight freshness. I don't really think their tea was all that great considering I didn't taste any tea flavor. The crystal bobas I added in complemented the drink nicely.",3.0 star rating
"Cool boba shop located in Hayes ValleyI love how diverse their menu is and they offer a great selection of drinks.Seating is pretty limited. They get busy so not enough seating for a lot of people. There are a couple tables and then next to the window are some bench like seats.Parking is pretty horrible in this area. Only street parking in this busy place so good luck finding parking. Customer service is fast and friendly. Prices are decent and they also offer a great check-in offer for yelpers; 1 free topping which is awesome. Drinks that I have tried are house milk tea and creme brulee. Creme brulee was quite interesting but overall not my cup of tea since it was way too sweet for me. However I really enjoyed the house milk tea which I got 30% sweet, highly reccomend! Overall it is a great quality boba shop that is definitely one of my go-to's now.",5.0 star rating
"Going to be a new ritual going to Urban Ritual! With so many boba shops in San Francisco, let alone the Bay Area, it's really hard to innovate something that already has a strong following. But...Urban Ritual is pretty damn good! With so many different ways to personalize your drink, there are so many combinations to choose from. First of all, the menu is pretty simple. You can either create your own drink with the following options:Tea: Early Grey Black Tea, Matcha Green Tea, Jasmine Green Tea, Honey Oolong, White Grape Oolong, Thai Tea, Hibiscus Herbal Tea (non-caffeinated), Chrysanthemum Tea (non-caffeinated)Milk: No Milk, Dairy, Additional $0.50 for Oat, Pea, or Macadamia Nut milkSweetness: 0/30/70/100 - None of that 120 percent sweetness BS that other boba places offer Toppings: Honey Boba, Crystal Boba, Aloe Vera, Lychee Jelly, Creme Brulee (Additional $1)Or One of their specialty drinks - which have creative syrups and strong herbal flavors to the mix. In the past couple times I have been here, I have created my own with oat milk and found it to be super creamy. I also love that they offer drinks without caffeine. Out of the speciality drinks, I suggest the Bae-Sil, Strawberry Milk Bar, or the White Grape Yuzu. They ran out of white grape when I came last time and they substituted this for Peach and I found it more sweet and fruity and hope they would keep this as a permanent offering! Since there are so many ways to personalize your drink,  it might take a while to find the perfect drink for your liking. To solve that problem, they had a few samples in the front and the staff was super accommodating and allowed me to try out any drink combinations I was skeptical about. The owner David, who also worked the cashier, was extremely humble and welcoming. I learned that he used to be a nurse and decided to finally follow his passion of opening Urban Ritual. It's a risk doing something like this, but I am so happy he did it because Urban Ritual has become one of my go-to places! Located in one of my favorite areas, Hayes Valley, I can't wait to keep coming to Urban Ritual.",5.0 star rating
"I really hate to give such a cool place only three stars, but my order unfortunately didn't live up to the hype this place has been receiving.Let me preface this--I love boba. Ever since I moved to SF, I realized just how few good, reasonably priced boba shops there are within arms reach in the city. This is something I took for granted in suburbia. So when I found this place, I was so ready to love it. I tried the creme brûlée tea with added creme brûlée pudding and pearls. It wasn't bad for the price, and the order came out pretty fast. Conceptually, the drink is pretty cool. It comes sprinkled with that burned/caramelized sugar crumble on top; when I mixed the drink, however, the texture was kind of odd. There was this delicious pudding--which honestly saved the drink because the tea itself was almost tasteless--but the textures clashed and it felt weird to drink. Silky pearls, gooey pudding, and hard sugar... it was kind of a lot going on in just one drink. Every sip without the pudding just tasted like water.Maybe I'll have to try this place out again, but I wouldn't go out of my way if I wasn't in Hayes Valley.",3.0 star rating
"I love the matcha toffee here! Great matcha flavor and the toffee bits are a unique add in. Their drink options are cool, some traditional that you would see in any boba shop but some fresh that more unique like the creme brulee or yuzu oolong. I definitely want to try everything on the menu.Creme brulee pudding is amazing and always worth the extra dollar (imo).",5.0 star rating
"Ordered the creme brulee as a Friday treat on a sunny San Francisco afternoon. Man, did it hit the spot!Who would have thought to blend creme brulee into milk tea? I mean it makes sense - egg pudding is one of my favorite traditional toppings (which is what originally piqued my interest) but wow. The additions of small bits of custardy creme brulee and torched sugar bits was amazing...!But what really put it over the top for me was the boba. It was cooked to the right consistency and scooped in WARM. I only know of one other boba shop that does that and trust me, it does make a world of difference.So hurry, get yourself a drink and cheers!",5.0 star rating
"I ordered the strawberry milk bar and it was fairly pleasant. It tasted refreshing yet really sweet at the same time. I liked the unique taste. It's quite reminiscent of the strawberry syrup at iHop. Atmosphere was cute, vibrant, modern, and bright. Just a little small since there was only 3 tables and a seating area in the corner. Cashier was really nice too!",4.0 star rating
"Wow. I've never been steered so wrong before, but my goodness, Urban Ritual was a terrible choice for boba. Ready to be blown out of the water, I dragged the hubby to Urban Ritual, located on a super busy street in San Francisco (although, what street is never busy?). The parlor itself is boring, but it has one accent wall with their logo and name. The menu is also extensive, having a few specialty drinks and another list of flavors so that patrons can concoct their own.I decided to get their house milk tea while the hubby got The Cloud, a cold brew coffee drink that was advertised to have notes of dark chocolate. Prices are typical, but keep in mind that the cups are downright tiny. However, in our case, we didn't mind the small size because we ended up throwing our drinks away anyway.The house milk tea was hideously bland. If I let it sit on my tongue for a bit, perhaps I could taste the notes of black tea, but it was honestly just water. The only decent aspect was how smooth it was. As for the hubby's drink, The Cloud was just bitter and boring. Yes, the coffee flavor was strong, but there was no creaminess to it and definitely no dark chocolate. It was just a boring iced coffee.Perhaps we chose the wrong drinks. Perhaps we stopped by at the wrong time. But there's one thing we know for sure: we aren't coming back.",1.0 star rating
"I don't care how many times I need to circle around this block and the adjacent areas for parking because I know that when I find parking... I can hit Urban Ritual and go two blocks on Laguna to grab a scoop of honey lavender from Salt & Straw.I'm so grateful that Urban Ritual hasn't, to my knowledge, tried a take on a strawberry matcha latte because that's really one of two main reasons I go to Boba Guys (it's the SML and their Duke of Earl Grey). The quality of UR's drinks in terms of taste and presentation is leagues above the chains (e.g., Sharetea, T4, iTea, Happy Lemon) and I'm actually frightened they'd eclipse Boba Guys in my heart, haha.So far I've tried the Creme Brulee which has spoiled all other creme brulee adaptations at every other boba spot I've gone to. You actually get that rich, custardy goodness AND the caramelized, slightly burnt, sugar topping, too. I also really like their Forever Young and White Grape Yuzu if I'm craving something non-milk based and fruity. I'd say the WGY is a much lighter flavor than FY; FY may be fruit-based but it's pronounced. Wonder what that would be like with real sangria...Props to UR for their specialty drinks and special ones to the person who did the hand lettering on their menu boards - beautiful job!",5.0 star rating
"I wanted to like this place, but their boba was just okay. To be honest, I didn't walk in so I don't know the vibe of this place, but based on pictures and their menu selection, this should have been a winner. On a cold Saturday night after dinner, my bf and I were craving a sweet drink and this was one of the few boba places opened later. Sorry, not trying to drive out of my way to Boba Guys. Saw this cute little joint and had the bf jump out and pick up the drinks.I got a Matcha Boba with Oat Milk (trying to copycat my order at Boba Guys). He got the House Black Milk Tea. It was not bad, but it wasn't great either. I forgot if it was the actual boba or the drink itself that was the meh part. So just based on their drinks itself, I remembered I didn't really like it. But maybe that was a one off.",4.0 star rating

"Best Earl Grey Milk Tea I've ever tasted! I'm always picky about my earl grey because honestly it's a hard milk tea to make well. Too much cream and you only taste the milk. Too much tea and it somehow tastes like soap water. (Teaspoon and Sharetea so far are my boba shops to avoid Earl Grey like the plague!)But, when I first walked into the Urban Ritual, and the nice cashier offered me a sample of their Earl Grey Black Tea mixed with Classic Milk and 75% (or 70) sugar, I fell in love at first taste. I then bought the Earl Grey Milk Tea at 75% sugar with honey boba, which I enjoyed every sip of! The honey boba wasn't too mushy (a nightmare if it is) and the sweetness of the honey was absolutely delectable.I absolutely HAD to buy another cup for my mom to try because she also loves Earl Grey, and carried that cup gingerly with me all the way back to Milpitas! (The cup saw a 1 hr 30min journey of walking to the nearest BART station, being jostled around on the rickety BART, and the drive back home) Needless to say, my mom loved it too and we'll definitely have it again when we go back to SF. I'll also be back to try everything else on their menu and be extremely extra while taking pics again, haha. It will be MY urban ritual to have their boba every time I visit SF!",5.0 star rating

"First time to Andytown. The layout and staff is very guest friendly. Grab a coffee or specialty, sit down and relax.

Went here with my family for coffee/tea.  It's a small place without indoor seating except a small wood shelf/bench.  There is some limited outside seating-a wood bench in a U shape with a few small round attached tables.  They do have a restroom.  They offer mainly coffee and tea drinks and some pastry like scones etc.  One drink is a plover that is flavored and much like an Italian cream soda.  One of us had the huckleberry-flavors change.  I had the real ginger tea that had slices of ginger in it and I really liked it.  It helped to let it sit for awhile to really pick up the ginger taste which I happen to love.  It was a nice place for a short stop.,4.0 star rating

"Hipster coffee shop located a block away from Ocean Beach.Been here quite a few times and it's one of my favorite coffee shops in SF. Their menu is unique because they offer a drink called ""Snowy Plover"" and different variations of it. Personally I skipped it because I'm not a fan of soda water!!My favorite go-to drink here is their Iced Mocha with their house made whip cream. Their whip cream is like crack so yummy and fluffy. I usually also ask for extra whip, a must!Prices are you average coffee shop prices raging from $4-$5 a drink. Usually spend about $10 if I'm with my boyfriend for 2 drinks.Customer service is fast and friendly. In this location they only have outdoor seating, all the way at the back of the store. They also have a nice bathroom which is a plus.Lovely coffee shop to drop by before your day at the beach.",4.0 star rating

"As mentioned before, my housemate and fiancé purchased many items from here in the past but only recently had I actually ventured in and got some things. Staff are so sweet and helpful. I usually make my way here after a few mile walk and get one of their almond latte's with the brown sugar simple syrup which is very tasty and not too sweet. I still love their apple and sausage corn muffin. One of the few muffins I can still enjoy lol. Glad it's an easy pick up close to home. Gonna miss this place when I move next year. Prices are fair and I always tip. They have dog treats that for some reason my housemates dog can't stand (she's picky and SPOILED) but it's cool they have them. Totally worth checking them out if you're close by. It's nice to have something other than a bar in the neighborhood. I'm kind of annoyed at the choices for morning and afternoon fare in this area. I just wish they had more offerings. I think they'd do really great offering a simple breakfast sandwich and small lunch options since they are open as late as they are. Brownies only take me so far in life LOL",5.0 star rating
"Very interesting special drink...the snowy plover is unusual because of the carbonation, but tasty nonetheless. I was hasty in my ordering and picked without reading the description. My first sip was met with mixed feelings, perhaps due to my own naivety. It took me a bit to truly enjoy the drink, but ultimately, I enjoyed it. The whipped cream on top was definitely delicious. The surroundings were clean, simple, and elegant. My friend and I enjoyed the small outdoor space in the back. It was chilly and a bit damp, but the sun came out and warmed up half of the space. I would come back and love to try their matcha drink.",5.0 star rating
"I love the vibe and service of Andytown. The coffee aromas remind me of ritual. It is the quintessential SF coffee shop complete with single brew coffees, $5 toast (mediocre), and specialty drinks (plover). I wasn't a fan of the plover which is soda water and coffee, so this time got the mocha instead. 3.5 stars for the mocha, in which you can really taste the quality chocolate. I wish it was creamier and more chocolatey though. The soda bread tastes like pita and is drenched in butter. The other sliced multigrain is also dense but looked too healthy. If you like dense toast I would instead recommend The Mill.",3.0 star rating
"Andytown adventures in the Sunset! I had been to the Lawton location near Ocean Beach and today I decided to take a trip to the Andytown on Taraval. I decided to lose my ""snowy plover"" virginity and get this drink. It's a coffee with seltzer water and half creamy coffee..also a dollop of whipped cream. It was okay and maybe I'll have a caffeine kick. I'm not sure. The interior is nice. There is no seating inside. You can sit outside in the back. This coffee business is interesting, so I decided to visit. Although, I would probably visit Lawton and not Taraval more often.",4.0 star rating

"Delicious and unique. I have tried Andytown's cappuccinos, Matcha Snowy Plovers, and the Peach Corn Bread and all were delicious. Snowy Plovers are a cold drink (coffee or matcha or whatever they're serving seasonally) with a huge slab of whipped cream on top: It looks almost like a root beer float or an affogato. The whipped cream is DELICIOUS; I wanted to just eat it by the spoonful. I enjoy this coffee shop because it encourages people to sit outside and talk since there really isn't much table space to do work. It's a block away from the beach and the street is full of palm trees. Definitely recommend checking out this location or the one on Lawton!",5.0 star rating
"tldr: The coffee cafe serves a drink called the ""snowy plover,"" and it can be made with matcha or espresso. Get it. Very good. Mix the cream before drinking. The ""snowy plover"" drink is why people come here. The drink is carbonated water, matcha/espresso, and a chunk of sweet cream. Make sure to mix the sweet cream before drinking, otherwise the drink can be off balanced. Less seating than other location, but new garden seating at back of cafe to open soon.

"My husband is a huge fan of coffee and I am a huge fan of independent/local coffee establishments. We finally made it out here to try their coffee. We don't normally hang out in the outer sunset. Located a couple blocks from the beach and from the SF ZOO. Otherwise, it is basically residential and parking is not an issue. I ordered a cafe au lait and my husband ordered a regular coffee. I had cafe au lait earlier in the year in New Orleans and well obviously, this doesn't compare. The coffee is a bit acidic but better than another local coffee joint that we went to the day before. It was a chilly morning but I would have liked to try one of their plovers given how popular it is. Nice interior that is very modern and simplistic. Nice spacious sliding door unisex restroom. Outdoor seating that is more for a limited time. The seats appears moist from the fog so we opted to walk around and drink our coffee in the car. I would come back if I was ever in the area but would not come out of my way.",4.0 star rating
"SF has always been known for coffee, but Andytown has really taken innovation of coffee up a notch. Stopped by with my girlfriend and got the infamous snowy plover. It seemed like it was made with sparkling water, shot of espresso, and topped with heavy whipping cream. After posing a few times to help my girlfriend get a nice Instagram photo of the decor, I finally got to take a sip of the drink. It was certainly different than my normal latte from Starbucks. It was very carbonated, but not too overwhelming. The buttery texture of the whipped cream was the highlight especially since we watched them whip it out freshly in front of us. It is one of those drinks that continue to grow on you and before you know it, the snowy plover was gone. I liked how they illustrated the ""bird theme"" throughout the store and it made it seem like we were just enjoying a cup of coffee right in the outdoors.",4.0 star rating
"Solid artisanal coffee shop in San Francisco, but I didn't really see anything that differentiated them from other artisanal coffee shops in the city. I stopped by around 11:45am on a Saturday, and it wasn't busy at the time. They had two pour over options to choose from in addition to the usual options of latte, etc. They also had a cold brew option available. I opted to try their Yirgacheffe Pour Over ($5), which was super smooth, but had a slightly acidic finish. They roast their beans in the back of the shop, which would be cool if they did a mini tour, or had a display window or something along those lines. Beans are around $14/bag. They also had some cookies available (vegan and non), but no other food options. Parking was easy at that time, and there were good metered street parking spots. I believe there is also one free street spot on the street right before the cafe.",4.0 star rating
"Below-the-radar artisanal coffee shop with an emphasis on single-origin coffee from Ethiopia. Their pour-overs are exceptionally well balanced, neither bitter nor acidic (a sign that the coffee extraction was just about right, neither under-extracted nor over-extracted). They roast the coffee beans themselves. The espresso we tried was from Columbia. The latte is quite smooth with an earthy/fruity profile, the kind you have come to expect from good coffee baristas. Definitely recommended if you are in the area.The only minus is that it was freaking cold in there. The building is an old warehouse of sorts, I guess not very well insulated and not well heated. In this current SF weather, this can get challenging! Bring a coat or try to snatch the one table that is by the front window.",5.0 star rating

"Life sure gets busy. For reasons I don't need to bore you with, I've recently been spending a lot more time in the East and South Bay. Some of it by choice, some of it not really. That means taking leisurely strolls around my SoMa neighborhood don't happen nearly as often as they did before. That also means discovering and hanging out at quietly relaxing coffee spots like Sextant becomes both a pleasure and a privilege. I'm treasuring moments like these a lot more lately, and it actually helps that the neo-industrial vibe of the space fits the neighborhood like a glove, not an O.J. glove, a real one (photo: bit.ly/2zMaSYk).The café and adjoining roastery are run by Kinani Ahmed, who was born and raised in Ethiopia, a fact pertinent to his business. His unique heritage informs the choice of coffee beans as they come from his country as well as Kenya and Colombia.

"As a 65-year old, perhaps I'm not hip enough for Sextant. Yesterday I wandered in and ordered a croissant and a latte. The barista handed me a croissant but forgot that a latte was ordered as well, so I paid again. She handed it to me with the comment, ""latte to go."" I replied that it was ""for here,"" (she didn't ask) but that it was no big deal. When I asked another barista for the bathroom key, she gave me an explanation that I couldn't hear over the grinding of coffee, so I just left.These observations are not major. The coffee was good but it was the attitude that annoyed the heck outta me.  Little interaction, not even an ""oops"" when she forgot my coffee, and for $10.25 for a small latte and a croissant, it's just not worth it.I won't be back and I'm sure they will do just fine without me as a customer.",2.0 star rating

"This place is around the corner from my garage (confusingly called ""The Garage"") and so I'll usually pop in to fuel up before the long walk across SoMA to get to work.They have the most futuristic bathroom system which is computer controlled and has some sort of queuing system built-in. I'm not sure if this is actually useful or just a fun use of venture capital money, but I enjoyed it.Last time I was here, I tried the Wired Gandhi, which is their version of a dirty chai. Like all dirty chais, it was a confusing drink to consume but had the desired effect, which was to dramatically increase the level of caffeine in my blood.The cafe itself is spacious with a pleasant wooden decor and friendly staff. I'll be back!",5.0 star rating
"I came here for the curry, and was surprised at how good it was. I've eaten at a few curry shops in SF, but this is the only one that actually makes a real Japanese curry that's worth paying restaurant prices.I had the regular curry with the scrambled egg. The egg was absolutely perfect. It was a shame to eat it. I'd love to see his omurice. That's probably be the best in SF.",5.0 star rating

"Fairly new to inner Richmond, nestled at the corner of 10th and Geary which you cannot miss. They were out of half of their topping options for their Japanese curry which made me hesitate but the outcome was good, keeping it to a minimal with just the scrambled egg option giving my palate more room to enjoy the flavors/spice in the curry sauce. Definitely took me back to the days I lived in Tokyo-- simplicity at its best. The egg was perfectly cooked and the roux was light to medium that did not leave me feeling guilty that I finished everything on my plate. Although next time I would love to try some of their toppings, seeing photos with the katsu, the batter looks light and fluffy-- possibly panko crusted?They also serve craft beers, draft of six and a couple bottled/canned options. Hope to see more Japanese & Japanese style beers to come!",4.0 star rating
"I came in and knew I wanted a katsu curry. It wasn't too crowded luckily when I came in so I ordered right away. I know other places do curry and it kind of tastes instant, but this one did not taste like an instant curry. I sat down and my katsu curry came to me. It was spicier than I expected, which was alright but not so good for my sensitive stomach. The katsu was crispy and delicious. I was glad that not all the rice was drenched in the curry sauce since I do not like sauce on all of my rice. I do wish there was a little bit more katsu because I definitely had more rice left over to eat. $12 isn't a lot for a meal, especially in SF, but I just wish there was a little more katsu. Other than that, it was a pretty solid katsu curry.",4.0 star rating
"This place didn't quite do it for me... I'm not sure if they have a proper kitchen considering that our curry and matcha cheese cake slice were all served premade / microwaved and not fresh (we saw it and heard the beeps). You can tell the katsu was not fresh either because of how moist and non-crispy the bottom was: evidence of having been refrigerated and thrown into the oven prior to serving. I didn't order the swirled egg on top so can't speak to that, but I just couldn't get over the fact that the food was not made fresh.Utensils were also kind of grimy, so that really sealed the deal...it's a no from me.",2.0 star rating

"Walked into this place ready to love it, but have to admit it was just okay.The Hojicha latte was so weak, and to my surprise, unsweetened.A big plus on the katsu curry was the light, crispy batter on the katsu. The pork was a little fatty between the crispy coat and meat. The portion is a little smaller than most places but it was enough food for me and at $11 (regular curry + katsu), it is a little cheaper than other places as well. The curry was not bad, it reminded me of curry from Tani's Kitchen but it was less savory than Tani's.",3.0 star rating

"Came here with some friends on a weekend. We got: matcha latte, latte, black sesame daifuku, matcha cheesecake, and two toasts. Atmosphere was good, we had a great time talking over some warm drinks and food.2 things that bothered me:- cheesecake slice came out with half of its crust missing. Didn't expect that kind of service here. - the water pitcher tip was crusting from the water buildup. Doesn't look like they clean it. Everything else was fine.The Daifuku sold there is just the 大福 brand unwrapped found in Asian grocery stores. Not freshly made in case anyone is wondering.From other people's reviews, it sounds like a lot of the stuff is not freshly made.Is it called Back Room or... Cutting Corners Cafe?",3.0 star rating
"Back Room is a secret ninja Japanese Curry spot that is hidden in plain sight! For locals that grew up in the Richmond district, the old Coffee Break location was one of the neighborhood places for coffee. The sign for Back Room pales in comparison to the long-standing huge Coffee Break signage. It also doesn't help that peaking in the place still resembles a cafe mostly.I stumbled upon Back Room somehow in my weekly deep dive into the Yelp app. What caught my attention was the swirled egg scramble on top of rice! I have watched videos and old clips of the technique in the spiral egg mountain and have failed to recreate it. When seeing one of the pictures of the egg on this Yelp photo I set my destination for the day.I ordered a Japanese curry with katsu and the scrambled egg. This was one of my favorite curry I have had in SF. The egg was well done and the katsu was juicy with a nice crunch! The curry had a mild kick to it but nothing spicy for someone like me who can barely handle hot Cheetos.I also ordered a iced kuromitsu kinako latte drink but this wasn't anything spectacular. It tasted mainly like a lightly sweet milk that I would have added to a tea to make milk tea with lol.One thing to note... when I came it was one man handling the cooking and register. This was unfortunate as many other groups of customers that came after us waited for 5-10 minutes before first contact and decided to leave. When I was done backup came but it was already too late. I hope this place can get their operations set and push the marketing up a bit. I don't want this place to go away!TLDR if you don't mind waiting 30+ minutes for Japanese curry this little hidden gem is a nice spot.",5.0 star rating

"Really great toast. Thick slices of bread - crisp on the outside but fluffy on the inside. Great balance of flavors on the salmon cream cheese toast. The lemon zest complements the salmon and seasoning offsets the cream cheese. Super fun exercise in balancing flavors and textures. When it comes to toast, these guys are playing 3D chess.

"This. IS. My. FAAAAAV Boba in All of SF right now.Especially the White Gourd Milk Tea. Oh. Goodness. Please. Just try it once. 25% Sugar, less ice with either pudding or boba. It's the bomb I've had Boba's all over SF and in San Jose, but as of right now, I think I would say, it is the best in SF.I have tried their Pudding Milk tea, it was pretty good as well, but I will recommend the White Gourd over it.Honestly, it's too good to the point that I've been coming back 3 times this week.. day after day... that the lady in the shop remembers what I get now The price is your average boba, but parking might be a little struggle.There are a few parking in the front, which is usually not open though - unless you're lucky.The store is quite small, with few seatings.. and so far always clean.Definitely a must try!!! ‍",5.0 star rating
"Little Sweet was a stop on my way to dinner. I ordered two drinks - a regular milk tea for my man and a White Gourd Milk tea for me. When I went to order I told the guy taking my order I don't really like sweet drinks so I wanted to go for 25% sweetness for my White Gourd Milk Tea. He said the drink isn't that sweet and told me 50% would be not sweet already, and I hesitated and he said 50% is the best since they basically water it down to tone down the sweetness so it won't be sweet. So I agreed for 50% sweetness with his reassurance.For toppings, I asked about white boba - like was it the type that's crunchy, bouncy from other places like agar boba? He said the difference was that it is cooked vs uncooked and that he would not define any of the boba toppings as crunchy or bouncy. I was thinking...why would I want to eat uncooked boba aka tapioca starch balls!? Turns out it is NOT uncooked boba - so do not be alarmed since he wasn't good at describing...After I ordered and tried it in my drink I can confirm that it is actually the clear agar boba balls that is offered at other places. I tend to prefer it to actual boba since it is less sweet and has a smooth bouncy crunchy texture - hard to describe but that's what I would say. PS: If you don't like sweet drinks - DO NOT ORDER 50% White Gourd Milk Tea - it is waaaay tooo sweet despite his reassurances - tastes like 100% sweetness. White gourd lovers - we knowww that the drink is sweet already - so I can't imagine what actual 100% tastes like. If you decide to come here maybe opt for 25% sweetness if you have tastebuds like me! The other order of milk tea was decent but nothing to write home about. Would I come here again? No. But if you do, I hope you get a more helpful person taking your order.",3.0 star rating

"Longest line I've ever seen and longer wait than boba guys which makes no sense.45 min - This is the longest I've ever waited for boba. I'm still waiting right now but I can't imagine non dairy milk tea to significantly blow things out of the water.--Just got the boba. High mountain tea and white gourd (winter melon) tea at 25% sweet. The high mountain is insanely bitter with very strong tea flavor. I can't even taste the milk in the milk tea. It's non dairy but it tastes like full blown iced tea on steroids. (think Chinese medicine level bitterness) The white gourd is pretty good and I would order it again.  It has a unique flavor and it is creamy. Either way, this is 45 min I'll never get back in my life. Please, please, please hire another person in the back. It shouldn't take this long to make two drinks when most of these items are premade.",1.0 star rating
My favorite boba spot in the city. I can't believe I kept passing up this place even though I live a block away. The white gourd milk tea is my go to drink. White gourd is a winter melon and it is very refreshing to drink on a hot sunny day. I have never had something like this before. It is very unique.My second favorite drink here is the high mountain milk tea. This is a little sweeter so I recommend getting it at around 50-75% sweet.The day time worker here is very friendly. She always helps me grab the straws and she gets me drink made in a fast and timely matter. Night time workers are okay but that's because this is when it is most packed.,5.0 star rating

"If it seems like I've been going to a lot of new boba shops lately, you're right. Moving to the Bay has meant trying out each tea store on every corner, and I am showing no signs of stopping.For a place called Little Sweet, there's a big crowd and a big menu. But after the week prior's burn with Tancca, my significant other and I decided to go back to our usual drink orders: Thai tea with honey boba and a salted cheese tea. (I still chose to mix it up with some high mountain tea, because I hadn't seen that in a while.) We got to the front of the line and our teas fast given that there were half a dozen parties waiting when we walked in. Part of the delay was that someone ordered a paper grocery bag full of milk teas. Hey man, you wanna be my friend? Anyway, it's pretty cool of them to do bulk orders like that. It would be a great spot for an afternoon office catering trip.The drinks are decently sized for the amount paid. It's on-par as far as the price goes, but I think the quality is in the upper echelon of boba shops in San Francisco. Their tea is strong (it definitely kept me up that night) and the drinks themselves aren't too sweet. I'd say a 75% sweetness level is perfect for me here because I like mine on the sugary size.The only thing I didn't like about this place was the menu formatting. Instead of having prices in a tradition $X.XX format, everything was done up in two-digit decimals, confusing me at first sight. There's also an asterisk and exclamation point legend that makes me feel like I'm doing mental gymnastics when trying to figure out whether my drink is caffeine free.Also, they charge extra if you want your drink without ice, which is annoying. I haven't tested it so I don't know if you actually get more drink with it, but it sounds nonsensical: paying more to get less.",4.0 star rating
"Love when I find good boba spots!My Taiwanese side makes me such a snob when it comes to boba, I get so picky about it. But this place really impressed me. I tried their Brown Sugar Milk Tea with an adjusted sweetness of 75%, which is the highest level of sweet I'd get for my drinks. I loved how my drink came out not too sweet because I was still able to taste the strong aroma of tea. The boba pearls were also cooked to perfection! I don't even bother going to places like Quickly's because you can easily tell how low quality it is compared to here. There was only 1 worker making all the drinks, while the other person was working as cashier. So kudos to that hardworking lady for making my drink bomb!  There was a line though, so hopefully they have more workers.",5.0 star rating
"This has been my go to spot in SF for milk teas and boba. Imo this place is highly underrated and is a local spot for boba connoisseurs who prefer strong tea flavors in their drink. Everytime I come here staff has always been welcoming and accomondating. Drinks are always consistently strong here which i prefer. If you prefer sugary milked down drinks go to the many other boba places scattered across SF. Just recently I ordered their sweet potato fries and my friend dropped them all over the floor. I told the barista and she kindly said ""it's fine I'll clean it up in a bit. Do you want a replacement ?"" I offered to pay for the 2nd batch but she refused. This was during a busy Friday to where she was handling other people's orders. Wow such courteous here. Gives me more reason to be a strong supporter other than their solid drinks Only gripe about this place is every time I come here street parking is a hassle.

It seems like they only have one size for drinks here because all of our drinks we ordered were quite big.I thought my brown sugar milk tea was good. It wasn't too sweet and my boba pieces were chewy and had a good flavor to it. I've noticed that not all boba places marinate their boba with flavor, but it seems like this one does. That is a huge plus! The boba here isn't very hard like a few other boba places I've been to in this city. It as perfectly chewy, without being too hard or too mushy.

The drink is delicious , half coffee and half black tea sweetened with condensed milk. Reminded me of Hong Kong milk tea, flavor was perfect not too overwhelming and definitely refreshing . I had to google what kaya meant since I never heard of it, apparently it's a popular Singaporean item. It's made with pandan and coconut milk - very smooth and not too sweet.

"I've been to Breadbelly a couple of times, and the food is really good, and really pretty. I can see why it's popular with those who are active on Instagram. The food they offer is Asian-influenced. I really like the pandan toast, which is a coconut spread. Pandan is popular in the Philippines. Because it's a vibrant green, it's really pretty in pictures. Another delicious snack offered is their curry, which a fried dumpling with chicken curry inside. I've also tried their sticky bun, butter mochi, and the ham/cheese ensaymada. Out of the three, I really enjoyed the ensaymada. The cheese and ham are sprinkled throughout the pastry, so you don't miss out on any ingredient with each bite. The sticky bun was good too, preferably warm.  I didn't like the butter mochi much. Since the space is small, it gets crowded fast. When I wanted to dine in, the employee said I could ask one of the single diners if they don't mind sharing a table. I was eyeing a table to ask, but after I paid, that diner left. The women next to that table took it, and said their friend was sitting there. So I ended up eating at one of the small counters they have where you have to stand. By the time I was done with my ensaymada, their ""friend"" still hadn't shown up.  Most of their patrons are locals, who definitely take their time, which is fine. But I find the rest of their patrons, tbh, annoying, and so I plan on going back very early in the morning to avoid the crowd, and to get a table.However, the employees are very, very nice! They're very welcoming and are happy to talk to you about the menu and answer any questions you have. They are pricey, but it's high quality and you shouldn't miss out.",4.0 star rating
"I'm a big fan of Asian pastries and when I found out that Breadbelly was finally opening their own restaurant/cafe, I HAD to go. What originally caught my attention was their Kaya Toast. I absolutely love pandan flavored anything and kaya is pandan in a sweet spreadable form. The fact that it was spread atop a fluffy piece of toasted brioche bread sold me. I wanted it. I also wanted to try their porridge but my friends were against eating at Breadbelly for lunch since the lunch menu is limited and on the pricier side for the portion size. So... we settled on ordering almost every pastry :) Kaya Toast: Fluffy brioche topped with a THICK layer of kaya jam. While it was delicious, it was extremely sweet and definitely something to share with others. Aesthetically it looked great!Not Ube Tart: Maybe my favorite! Not surprised since there's purple sweet potato inside. The tart crust was buttery and flakey, the sweet potato filling wasn't too sweet, and the meringue + salted egg yolk shavings added lightness to the pastry. Good use of textures and flavors!Brown Butter Mochi: Chewy like mochi, dense, and of course, buttery. It was good but I wouldn't get it again. If you like butter mochi or haven't had it before, try it!Ham and Cheese Ensaymada: My least favorite and only because I'm not a fan of savory pastries. My bf liked it, I think it was his favorite. I recommend it if you like savory pastries and think the flavor combo is interesting. Choco-Soba Ko-Cookie: Tied for favorite with the Not Ube Tart. I know it looks like a double chocolate chip cookie but it's different! I believe it's made using buckwheat flour (soba), making it a little earthier and sososo good! I would definitely get this again. Persimmon Satsuma Almond Cookie: The cookie base is a butter/shortbread book probably made using almond flour/almond extract? I really enjoyed the dried persimmon in the center. Kinda like thumbprint cookies! Not a must order but still worth trying. It makes me so happy when new bakeries pop up making traditional Asian pastries/flavors more appealing to people who might not have tried these flavors before. The pastry chefs at Breadbelly make their creations tasty and flavorful and combine flavors that aren't typically combined and they become pretty pieces of edible art. I'm a fan! And I'll be back to try their non-pastry items :)",5.0 star rating
"The kaya toast is wonderfully fluffy, served warm, and is ""not too sweet"" when you get the right ratio of coconut pandan jam in each bite :) I enjoyed the not-ube-tart but wouldn't go out of my way to get it again; I ordered it knowing full and well that I wanted taro, not purple yam, but then again... it's in the name.Really friendly service. I appreciate the option of coffee or beer - it's kind of hard to find a cafe/bakeshop type of place that'll serve alcohol, so Breadbelly really hits the mark. Perfect for breakfast, brunch, or just a snack. It looks like the neighborhood's welcomed Breadbelly with open arms, as there's a line out the door in the mornings. When I've stopped by around 1:30pm or so on the weekends, there's hardly a wait and plenty of tables to choose from.My favorite things, hands down, are the savory options. The breakfast sandwiches are fantastic!

"Finally, kaya toast makes it to SF! I'm a huge fan of kaya (been eating homemade kaya toast since I was a kid) and so was initially skeptical of the toast at Breadbelly. It looks a little neon green, but it's surprisingly delicious. The bread is thick, soft, and slightly salted--and the kaya is sweet. For anyone who doesn't know what kaya is, it's basically a delicious, dessert-like coconut and pandan paste. I'd definitely recommend trying it at Breadbelly!I also tried the sesame horchata, which tasted like black sesame milk with some cinnamon on top. Next time, I'll be back to try the brown sugar mochi with peanuts. Cute interior, too! Lots of natural lighting, hipster cafe-like vibes.",5.0 star rating
"It's great to see a pop-up gain such a following that it goes bricks-and-mortar. Breadbelly's founders bring Michelin-starred experience to their new venture, where they serve Asian-inspired pastries and baked goods that are not only packed with unique, interesting flavors, but are also perfect for Instagramming or other food p*rn purposes. The ""not ube"" tart, while quite petite, was dense and subtly flavorful enough to leave a sophisticated impression. The gyeran bbang (sweet corn bread with Korean chili, cheese, soft egg), while also petite, was a slightly more savory way to ease into the morning.None of the flavors will be overwhelming or cloying, but I think this is part of the point. And while you'll pay a pretty penny for everything here, you're getting items that are meticulously crafted and represent an inspired fusion of cultures and ingredients. Exactly what the Bay Area is all about.",4.0 star rating
"I wasn't expecting the kaya toast to be anything special, but it was amazingly. I don't usually like kaya Toast because it's so sweet, but breadbelly's kaya Toast paired with unsweetened coffee is perfect. The bread was so fluffy and buttery. The coffee was strong and had a nice dark roast. The place is a little small with limited seating but if you go on a weekday you should be fine.",5.0 star rating
"A few things! location doesn't have the best parking, however. the atmosphere is very clean and neat. i ordered the sesame horchata which was on the sweeter side and thick. definitely had both flavors! i also got the kaya toast because everyone was raving about it. It was a thick soft toast with pandan cream over it. which was powerful in flavor, however was too sweet after a few bites. finally, i got the red bean anko sticky bun. i really didn't like this one. flavor was weird. overall, this place is okay. took a while to get my drink and toast, given there weren't any other customers at the time",3.0 star rating
"After seeing so many pictures of the Kaya Toast from Breadbelly on Instagram, I was determined to go and persuaded my friend to go with me. We had a lovely time talking and catching up at the cute, cozy cafe, but the delicious treats soon were the only things that were on our minds when we took our first bite. Food:- Kaya Toast--$6My friend and I were absolutely blown away by this toast, and after one bite we were very tempted to buy one more. The toast used Breadbelly's milk bread, which was incredibly fluffy, soft, toasted to perfection, and buttery. The coconut-pandan jam on top was pleasantly sweet and creamy, and the flakes of sea salt sprinkled on top cut through the sweetness and brought all the flavors together. A new favorite toast that I will definitely be back for!- ""Not Ube!"" Tart--$7Another well-composed treat with sweet and salty elements, and a variety of textures. The torched meringue on top was incredibly creamy and airy and was the perfect complement to the chunky yet smooth purple sweet potato filling (hence ""not ube""). Shavings of salted egg yolk on top added a unique salty element to balance out the flavors. The tart crust was buttery and flaky too. Tips:- We arrived around 3 pm on a Friday and there was no line and spaces open at the tables. Highly suggest coming in during an off hour to enjoy the food in the store. The plates, interior decor, and brightly painted storefront must be enjoyed!",5.0 star rating
"Everything about Breadbelly is delightful! The cafe's food is yummy and their ceramic cups/plates are beautiful. We came on a Saturday morning and fortunately there was parking and plenty of tables inside.We ordered their kaya toast, their roasted garlic toast, ube tart, and the black sesame horchata drink. Both of the toasts were delicious. The pandan flavor on the kaya jam was flavorful but in my opinion, there was a bit too much. Ube tart was very sweet. The tart part reminded me of the classic Chinese egg tart pastry- thought it was an interesting twist. Tasted like what you'd expect (wish marshmallow wasn't that sweet). The only downside is that it's kinda pricy. They also forgot one of our orders but they were very nice about it and refunded me.",4.0 star rating
"Finally got to try Breadbelly today, and it didn't disappoint. This Asian American bakery started by two Atelier Crenn alums first caught my attention from Instagram, where they were advertising pastry boxes before the actual store opened. Everything is instaworthy, but the Not Ube tart was the stand out item for me. Interior: small but crowded on a Sunday Food: I tried 3 pastries and 2 drinks for $27- Not Ube Tart: The most delicious thing I had here. It's flakey, made of potato, and topped with the perfect cloud of cream and sugar. -Brown Butter mochi: I wasn't a huge fan of this, especially after the tart, and it tasted okay- Sesame cookie: this was pretty and wrapped up real nicely, but it tasted okay too. The sesame flavor is strong. -Sesame horchata: thick and yummy, with full on sesame flavor, if that's your thing. I haven't had anything like it before. I want to come back for the Kaya Toast since everyone was ordering it, but my belly was too full of bread :p",4.0 star rating
"Super cute cafe with good food and completely worth a return visit! Actually left the place wishing I lived in the area, since I would love to make this a frequent neighborhood spot. It's kind of a hipster Asian American trendy cafe? That's the only way I can describe it but it's so so good - a lot of the food here reminds me of updated takes on food I would eat at friends' houses at home. Highly recommend the kaya toast (coconut pandan jam) - very sweet without being saccharine and the bread itself is also really good. Also recommend the char siu sandwich. The bread is really good and soft and the pork was fantastic. I also got the 50-50 (half tea half coffee sweetened with condensed milk) and the Anko sticky bun!",5.0 star rating
"It's been about 2 months since they've opened their doors and things are looking great!  Awesome weekend crowd and plenty of offerings still available on Sunday around noon.  We came back to get a few of our favorites along with trying their ""not ube"" tart + the 50/50 drink, both were excellent as well.  Loved the salted egg yolk shavings on the tart, it's very unique and a great mix of sweet + savory.Definitely a great addition to the neighborhood.  If you haven't been by yet, go early in the day and give them a try!",5.0 star rating
"Beautiful, adorable breakfast/brunch place with creamy bread and photogenic, quirky baked goods. My friend and I were craving savory food, so we ordered the breakfast sandwich and egg pocket. I also got a black sesame horchata out of curiosity and my love of anything black sesame. Overall, this cute place is definitely worth checking out and splurging on at least once.The breakfast sandwich was warm and toasted to perfection. The red pepper spread was too spicy for me (I'm not a fan of spicy food), but my friend loved it. It's like a gourmet twist to a breakfast classic, a bit expensive though for the size (like $8).I was a little skeptical at first of the egg pocket being cold (I'm not a fan of cold asparagus or cold bread) but the biting into the freshness of the bread combined with the creamy egg salad made me forget all of my initial doubts. I inhaled that delicious egg pocket.The black sesame horchata was the most delicious (then again, it's literally a hybrid of two of my favorite flavors, horchata and black sesame so I'm biased). I'm so glad that I wasn't ""cheated"" as usual and the tall glass had the perfect amount of ice in it rather than way too much. It was creamy, sweet but not too sweet, and tasted like rice-y black sesame. I was okay with not being able to taste the cinnamon, since I'm pretty sure it would clash with the sesame.If I come back to treat myself one day, I will definitely try their famous pandan toast and yummy-looking cake.",5.0 star rating

"Such a cute little place!! Came here on a Friday afternoon. Was on the search for a place that had Oatly oat milk (most places have run out and are unable to restock due to a shortage). FARLEY'S STILL HAD OATLY!!I got an iced latte with oat milk and WOW. That's some good espresso. The latte tasted bold yet super smooth!! Not bitter at all!! The drink was less than $6, which is kinda rare for an oat milk latte!! Around $5 is still a lot for coffee, but it's kinda actually not terrible based off of prices in the area. The barista I ordered from was super friendly!!There's an outdoor parklet area that's wonderful for people watching. There's also a huge magazine corner inside with a Bottom line: Amaaazing latte!! Such a nice place to get some work done. Or to wait for a table at Plow...write your name on the list and head on over to Farley's to kill time during your 2 hour wait for brunch. Or get your drink to go and walk up and down the 21% grade streets of Potrero Hill. That's how we do it in SF. We wait for brunch like our lives depend on it. Anything for some good breakfast potatoes. ANYTHING. We also like to complain about the hills. I'll be back!! I really wanna try the golden milk latte!! Kinda pricy. But better than what you'll find at a lot of places in the area",5.0 star rating
"Dropped by on a Monday morning while waiting for a table at Plow. I was about to get my usual (a cappuccino) when I saw that they had a Golden Milk Tumeric Latte! I got excited and ordered it with oat milk - Oatly is the best! The woman at the counter was super friendly which made the experience all the better.  The shop itself was filled with people working on their laptops, reading, playing games, and families enjoying each other's company.

"My favourite place to study so far in SF. There are plenty of seating and the entire space is cozy, modern and clean. Parking is 2 hours on weekdays but there are plenty of 90 degree spots around the neighbourhood, so I wouldn't worry about that. I also like the fact that the neighbourhood is not too busy, which is a big problem for me when I go study, when there's a ton of traffic and people constantly coming in and out. At the same time, this is not one of those tiny cafes with extemely crowded space where you get distracted either by dead silence, or can hear every word of the conversatoon from the table next to you.",5.0 star rating

The cafe is pretty poppin so it may be difficult to find seating inside (especially on weekend afternoons), but I recommend this cafe if you're looking to chill with a book (no outlets)!

"One of my favorite spots in the city! A very cute Portuguese style cafe with good coffee and even better food. My favorite things to get are the breakfast board, banana bread, the chia bowl, and my guilty pleasure - a mimosa! The breakfast board comes on a chopping board with a few slices of ham, a warmed baguette, softened butter, and Portuguese cheese (I don't know my cheeses, but I'd say it tastes like a creamier Parmesan). For $7 it's quite filling, though the only downside is you have the slice the baguette yourself, which is a real arm workout since we were only provided with a butter knife. The banana bread warmed up is amazing, especially with the warmed butter it comes with. They're also quite generous with the mimosa, filled to the brim for $7! Check this place out if you're looking for a chill cafe in the Mission. It's a good place to spend a few hours studying at as well since there are outlets on both sides of the wall! No laptops until 2PM on the outlet tables on weekends though!",5.0 star rating
"I have a Sunday ritual of visiting a different coffee shop every weekend and enjoying an Americano and a good lunch. I thought I should start leaving reviews on these based on three criteria (5 being the best): Food, ambiance, and extras. You're probably wondering why I'm not grading on coffee? Well because I'm not an expert, but what I do know about is the above topics. Food: 5They have a tasty variety of options that range from small bites like a toast or for larger appetites they have sandwiches and salads. I had the avocado toast which was good, fresh, and I liked the chili oil that was drizzled on top too. I had been here once before, and I'm pretty sure I got a salad and was happy with that also.Ambiance: 4This cafe was so cute and bright. Plenty of seating and plugs along the walls. There wasn't anything super special about it, but I was comfortable, and the natural light is critical. They did have a little bit of a fly issue... but they flew pretty high that they weren't a real bother. Staff was friendly didn't go much out of their way, but helpful when asked. Extras: 3They had reliable free wifi, which is a must and they had a table or two outside in case of a beautiful day. Other than that, there wasn't much more to tout about.",4.0 star rating
My rating is for the Latte only.  Have not tried anything else yet.I usually buy coffee at Pete's or Starbucks but I was in the area and my friend offered me a Latte.   I was looking forward to it because the Cafe has good ratings.   Unfortunately the Latte did not live up to my expectations .My friend got a coffee and food item and was happy with their purchase so I guess it's just hit or.miss.Back to Pete's for me,2.0 star rating

Quick take: Love this spot for a lazy Sunday brunchThis place has really great breakfast and brunch items. St. Jorge is a CA/Portuguese inspired cafe. Very fresh and organic foods. This place is a small spot. We have been lucky and got a table both times we came in. The line moves fast but you do have time to decide what to order while waiting in line.Baked egg breakfast slider: Add ham/avocadoOrange blossom waffle:Add fruitOrange SumoSpicy Chai LatteWe ordered a panini sandwich....it had pesto in it.

We got the vegan almond butter chocolate chip cookie ($3) which had good flavor, but slightly dry, crumbly texture.The slices of vegan strawberry cake and coffee-chocolate swirl cake ($4 each) were phenomenal, though---they were moist and substantial and nicely sweet. Everyone loved these.We also enjoyed our almond latte and capuccino. Come to Cafe St. Jorge for a vegan Portuguese treat.",4.0 star rating

"My girlfriend and I love this cute little spot! With a bright, cozy yet airy atmosphere and delicious vegan options, you really can't go wrong. Our go-to items are:-- Avocado Chili Toast // A little pricey for what you get, as with all avocado toasts, it seems, but really delicious with the lemon and high quality bread they use. We've had it with the gluten-free sourdough as well, and it's a little smaller but yummy! -- Orange Blossom Waffle // A vegan waffle with real maple syrup, we usually add the fruit for $3 and it's totally worth it (check out the photo). It's a beautiful presentation and nice amount of fruit that really bump it up to an actual breakfast. We've also tried a few of the vegan pastries, like the Nutella muffin and coffee cakes, all of which have been very tasty. Looking forward to trying their chia pudding and other offerings soon. Overall this is an unassuming location with more than you'd expect held within its doors, so I highly suggest you give them a try next time you're craving some coffee and a nice pastry or light breakfast!",5.0 star rating
"This review has been in my ""unfinished review"" queue for quite some time, so it's time to clean house...I visited Cafe St. Jorge with my vegan Yelp friend, Regina, back in February. She was very gracious and met up with me when I needed to work and she found a place with vegan options that was laptop friendly. She actually did a very good job reviewing this place for the both of us, so I'll keep the rest short.Yes, they don't offer vegan matcha lattes, they should consider adding these to their menu since match is exploding in popularity these days. Moreover, while they offered a number of vegan baked goods, I found them to be average.I'd work from this cafe again if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so since they only offer tea and no tea lattes.",3.0 star rating
"I recently traveled to Portugal for a few weeks and was blown away by the delicious food. They are most known for their egg tarts (pasteis de Belen or nata) and I probably had about a dozen of them while I was there. So when my friend and I saw this café on yelp, I was skeptical.

"I live walking distance from this spot so I'm here quite a bit either to grab coffee/pastries to go, breakfast with a friend, or to work on days when I work from home (they have wifi). Overall I really enjoy Cafe St. Jorge because; everything I've tried has been tasty and isn't super heavy, it can get crowded but there isn't usually a wait, and the unique Portuguese spin on many of the dishes. My favorites include:- Chia bowl w/homemade granola: light, sweet, tasty.- Orange blossom waffle w/fruits: visually pretty and yummy- The goose is loose: sweet and savory, a little heavier, good for lunch and you can get it with a side salad- Baked egg breakfast slider: savory and a little sweet, small portion",4.0 star rating

"I was looking for a vegan friendly place to meet up with my friend where we could get coffee/tea and which was known to be laptop friendly if she wanted to stay and work on her computer afterwards. I also wanted a place that had at least some vegan food since I hadn't eaten breakfast yet. This place seemed to fit all of those criteria and had a high rating, so I recommended that we go here. This place is located in Bernal Heights and street parking is free on Sundays, but you will likely still have to park a couple blocks away and walk. They don't have matcha lattes here if that is your drink and while they serve Stumptown Coffee, my mocha turned out so bad it was practically undrinkable. While they had clearly marked vegan options on their menu, most of them where on the sweeter side and I prefer savory vegan breakfast a lot more. For food my friend ordered a vegan blueberry muffin and I ordered avocado toast and vegan banana bread (which they ran out of and I switched to chai coffee cake). My avocado toast was good, but nothing I would go out of my way to seek out again and the coffee cake was just okay too. Really if the coffee sucks, it's pretty much impossible for me to give higher than a 3 star review. The only thing keeping this review lower than 3 stars for me was their menu was vegan friendly with clearly marked options. I don't plan on coming back.",3.0 star rating
"I have such lovely memories of coming here on Valentine's Day in 2016 with one of my best girlfriends. Granted I have not been back to visit since, as I moved to Los Angeles later that year, but I remember we had the best time. Our server was a jolly woman who was nothing short of perfect and offered us glasses of champagne while we admired the variety of teas and treats on the menu. I would have never thought that a tea room in such a modern building would be enjoyable, as I have always experienced high tea in cozy, quaint shops, but we had an excellent couple hours, enjoying all of the positive, happy vibes bouncing off the walls. Also, the parking garage across the street was great and made it possible for us to fully appreciate our experience, as there is nothing more aggravating than having to drive around for ages trying to find a spot.I would definitely stop by Crown & Crumpet again, the next time I'm in the area!",5.0 star rating

"I really enjoyed Crown and Crumpet! A friend and I visited this tea stop cafe on a Wednesday early afternoon and there were only a few people there. The LivingSocial deal was great. It was $48 for 'Afternoon Tea' for two people (on a weekday) which is a good deal because regular price is $34 a person. I didn't realize it's just inside of the New People building. The ambience was kind of awkward just because it's out in the open and anyone walking by can look at you.  Minus one star for the environment.I loved the 3 tiered stand with all the goodies. Bottom tier had a variety of tea sandwiches and salad, middle tier was warm biscuits with 3 different spreads, top tier was chocolate covered strawberries, brownies, and other little dessert treats. Everything was delicious! I thought I might be hungry afterwards, but there was so much food included in the package that we even brought some of the desserts home.I tried the Paris tea which was delicious! Perfect balance of vanilla and caramel and... tea! Added a little milk and sugar to top it off. My friend had the lychee tea. It was a bit too strong of Lychee flavor for my taste, though.Customer service was great! Our server topped off our tea after a while to make sure it was nice and hot. He periodically checked on us to ensure we were enjoying ourselves. Since the location is in Japantown, it was a bit difficult to find parking. There are meters close by and also hour-limit parking around too.I will definitely come back and bring other people to this spot. This was my first tea party experience in San Francisco and I was really satisfied with this venue.",4.0 star rating

"I have been here before with my boyfriend on a date nearly 3 years ago. It's a very tiny space located in the lobby of the New People building of Japantown. The decor is very girly and cute, reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland. The food doesn't really stand out here. It's nice, but not stellar, and not worth near $40 in value. I was also disappointed that they had no petit fours, which is my favorite dessert to have with high tea.I only chose this place to come for my most recent high tea experience because my friend had never been here before. We both enjoy high tea, so this was a place for her to at least try.Despite being 15 minutes late to our reservation, I appreciated that the waitstaff was still so accommodating. My friend ended up being half an hour late, and while waiting for her, our waiter was so nice and patient to explain the different teas to us. I was intrigued by the Alice Drink Me Tea, which is a super floral black tea. I found the scent to be very fragrant and lovely. The waiter warned it could be in your face, but I appreciated the strong aroma.While the waitstaff was nice, they have to kick you out since they need to adhere to time limits for everyone.

Their lemon ginger scones served with Devon cream, lemon curd and strawberry preserves were scrumptious - I've had scones all over the US and England, and these were exceptional. Highly recommended.",5.0 star rating
"For some reason, my friend and I keep coming here every 2 years, but this will be my first time writing a review.Despite it's horrible location (awkwardly on the first floor lobby of a ""mall"" and there's no parking except for street and the expensive garage), this place is wonderful. They make the space work and keep it cute! Service here is always 200% amazing, and the food is always good. They take reservations through Yelp which saves so much time because they are usually busy. I usually order the Afternoon Tea for One and special request for vegetarian and fruit free (stupid raw fruit allergy), and they always make it work. Thank you for that because I know it is inconvenient for the kitchen. My only complaint are the desserts they pick for the Afternoon Tea sets are too sweet and don't fit with the high tea vibe. I wished they would consider something like jam cookies or maybe a slice of cake. Other than that you guys are great, and I love coming here!",5.0 star rating
"This place is really cute! We had a reservation so we sat down right away. We also came during the holiday season so there was a holiday menu, cute decorations, and a photo area for pictures! We also got cute little prizes with the holiday ""cracker"" as part of the holidays. Our server was really nice and he was understanding of how we wanted to take pics and helped us take our pics too! Good ones at that :) we came for my friend's birthday and sang happy birthday!Platter favorites:-blueberry scones were amazing! I really liked the lemon curd and cottage spread! Very tasty-turkey and cranberry tea sandwich and egg salad because I like tiny sandwiches-salmon toast -fudge brownie dessertTeas:-merry matcha was very fragrant and had a sweet taste. Tasted better on its own -earl gray was pretty standard-peach green tea was light -grapefruit green tea was light and tasty! Very refreshing. No need for sugar or milk-English black tea was good! I like to put milk and sugar for it to taste like milk tea hahaOverall, very cute place! I think it is worth the money since you leave feeling full! They even offered to box up our leftovers and gave us a cookie to go :)",5.0 star rating
"Yes, yes, and yes! This place is hidden (literally) in Japantown and is very cute.  I was confused when the Uber driver dropped me off because I was not expecting this place to be in Japantown.Regardless, anyone who fancy tea time needs to come try this place out.  They have ""Afternoon Tea for One"" for $32, which is very reasonable.  This  option comes with your choice of loose leaf tea, sandwiches, one scone, one crumpet, clotted cheese, lemon curd, jam, and a few bites size sweets.  My favorite was their blueberry scone.  Nom. Nom.  The Tea for One really does fill you up. If you have a group of friends, you can enjoy different types of tea.  We tried the Lychee Black Tea, Chai tea, their premium black tea (my favorite), and a green tea (that I don't remember the name).  So put on your pretty dress and make a reservation via Yelp and enjoy some tea!",4.0 star rating

"My daughter and I went to Crown & Crumpet this morning for her friend's birthday tea party. It's located right in the middle of Japan town (so you can do your shopping at the Asian supermarkets or Daiso before or after tea)! So the tea shop is located on the ground floor with cute little tables and lovely decor. They have a party room upstairs and this is where we were seated. The decor is wonderful! They have a wall of china plates which they call The Great Wall of China (get it?)!!!! There is a large cardboard cut out of Queen Elizabeth so you are at tea with the queen! They had the table set up with crafts for the girls on one end and a few seats for adults on the other end. Our hits very graciously ordered high tea for parents as well! The hostess for the tea party takes care of everything...so parents can sit back and enjoy their tea as well. The girls made little craft bags and they were given an option of swamp tea (a tropical punch) or blue eyes (which was a pink punch of some sort).Their menu is quite extensive and they have a range of teas to choose from. The food trays arrived and we had an assortment of sandwiches, scones and sweet treats! It was thoroughly enjoyed by all!After we were done eating, sone games were played:  tea bingo and pass the parcel. After this, birthday cupcakes! All in all the girls were entertained for a solid two hours. This is a great place to take your friends for tea, have a birthday party or a baby/bridal shower. We will definitely be back!",5.0 star rating
"Super random location, but affordable and great service.  Crown & Crumpet occupies this random front entrance to the mall, by the New People door sign.  Even as you sit there, it feels odd, random, and out of place- but it's kind of this awkward quirkiness which makes me like it. It definitely feels very Japan. They have a photo booth and photo booth wall with cutesy little chairs and table covers.  They have a wide tea selection- our whole group got the nursery tea (the one for children, heh) because we wanted a wide sample of food. Our server was super friendly about it and we were super happy with the selection.",5.0 star rating
"I love Crown and Crumpet so much! It's a perfect place for a birthday party (for any age) or a date, and sits in the heart of Japantown, right across from Benihana and the Kabuki theatre. Inside the building are Japanese shops to explore. As for tea, they have Afternoon tea which is the classic high tea option, which is cheaper for children! They also offer lunches and cheaper tea options if you don't want to go full high tea. They serve sandwiches of the day but always have vegetarian options prepared, you just need to ask!Don't forget to tell them if it's your birthday ;)",5.0 star rating
"Heather L. and I decided to splurge on an afternoon tea date. Customer service here was excellent. I asked for iced tea and they were able to accommodate my request without hesitation. Our waitress was also attentive to us and our needs/questions. A++++ My favorites from the afternoon tea spread were: all the sandwiches, blueberry and oat pastry, salted caramel brownie, scone, and crumpet. I was excited to see crumpets because I've never had one before. The texture was soft and fluffy! Yes, please. We were pretty full before we even got to the pastries! We ended up taking all of the pastries to go. Also, be sure to ask for refills of your tea. It's included! It's pretty pricey, but the overall experience was nice. I love having afternoon tea with the girls, so I personally think it's worth the price tag.",5.0 star rating
"If you are in the market for an afternoon tea dearie, you'll likely find Crown and Crumpet an adorable and cheeky option in the city.Its located across the street from Japantown's Kintestsu Mall (the Japantown Peace Plaza) in the lobby of the modern, glass fronted New People Building. Despite their lobby set up, they have managed to make the space here feel cozy and as charming as is possible to given space constraints.  We had the afternoon tea for $32, which is near impossible to find anywhere around town elsewhere on a Monday.  (Many places in the city offer high tea on weekends only, or W-Sunday.)Our tea server was friendly and knowledgable, and was being served up with a British accent by owner Christopher Dean.  Our tea included chopped egg & turkey, smoked salmon and pesto tea sandwiches,  a petite cheese scone, the never eaten salad.  On the middle tier, we were served crumpets and scones with clotted cream, jam and lemon curd.  On the top layer, desserts, including matcha cake with strawberry frosting, caramel chocolate brownies, rose infused shortbread, and a chocolate covered strawberry. They have a fairly concise tea selection here, but the list included many herbal and black tea options.  Charming spot, full of groups of ladies in summer dresses having tea!",4.0 star rating
"In the past I have hated on crown and crumpets but I recently went again and I actually quite enjoyed myself. It is still definitely one of the more expensive high tea places and doesn't give that much food, however the food I had was really really tasty. Specifically, I LOVED the scone and crumpet. The scone did still have that dryer texture but it tasted really good. Plus I love that they give you a crumpet because that is more unique. The crumpet was perfect. The cucumber mint sandwich was very tasty as was the turkey blt. The sausage rolls smelled really good but were meh (we didn't need to get a separate order of sausage rolls.) The desserts were good as well. I had a great time chatting with my friend and sipping tea. Oh! I got the Marie Antoinette tea and that was really super tasty. I would come back again!",4.0 star rating
I think this place is over-rated. The establishment is really small and located in the lobby of a hotel. It was very hard to find and they do not answer their phone when I tried to call them when I was lost. I called three times and no answer. I asked them why they did not answer and they said they were busy and rarely answer during peak times. The assortment of teas was alright but the tea came out lukewarm​. The food was decent but I would have liked more variety of​ cakes and sandwiches for the price.,3.0 star rating

"Love This Philz Coffee In SF's Potrero Hill Hood...SITREP.,.in marked contrast to the Philz here in Sacramento that is much more...uh... *meh.When I'm visiting in Potrero Hill, this is my 1ST choice to come to for coffee, and I have to give thanks to the Yelp app, since I found this spot with it.  THE SETUPSituated just to the right of the I-680 Freeway, this was only a 10-minute walk from buddy's home where I was staying.  It kinda is in an industrial area, of sorts, but this neighborhood has a lot of work/living loft arrangements and a lot of businesses in old warehouses.The advantage of this is that this Philz is quite spacious!  Lots of room inside.  And lots of room on the outside front patio.I would have preferred to have been outside, but I specifically posted here for a few hours to give my iPhone X a chance to update with the new iOS 12.1 operating system without interruption and I wanted my laptop to be juiced up for the entire time, so I chose a table with outlets.COFFEE & QUICHE!While here let my laptop and phone update themselves, I casually wrote some Yelp reviews, and enjoy some of the taste treats here:* I had their coffee ""Ambrosia of God"" - a delightful flavor.  What I am put off by, though, is their strict barista regulation of all ""input"" into the coffee.  By that, I mean, THEY also put in the sweeteners, and THEY also put in the Creamer, and THEY also put in any of the powdered flavors you want in your coffee.  yelp.com/biz_photos/phil…   I like doing that myself, no offense.  * I also had their artistic looking vegetable quiche - it was stylish & tasty, if a bit more pricey when compared to other coffee shop quiches I patronize.yelp.com/biz_photos/phil…WIFIDefinitively yes.  But after all, ""WiFi"" IS a filter I include in my search so I would have been sorely disappointed if they hadn't.DECOR!Both beautiful art and contemporary decor make this a pleasant place to gaze upon while contemplating what to write.Their lighting is also cleverly created to show ""Love"".yelp.com/biz_photos/phil…THE LOWDOWNThank you, Philz, for providing a nice spot to both relax and get some work done, while enjoying some coffee & taste bites in the meantime!",4.0 star rating
"Today's order:* Dancing Water        * Straight up (no cream, no sugar)Pros:* The drink was as good as to be expected from     any Philz  * The baristas were quickCons:* The location (which is also their corporate office)     didn't give off the most inviting feeling* It may be because their bosses are right upstairs    but the baristas didn't seem as cheery and jovial    as I've experienced from many of their other      locations* Due to the vibe from the workers it didn't feel like     this was somewhere I would want to plant myself      and get work done",3.0 star rating

"If you're an avid Philz fanatic, there are a few locations you NEED to visit--the first one being the OG first ever Philz in the Mission on 24th St and another one being THIS ONE!! The Philz HQ!!It's tucked away in a kinda quiet industrial neighborhood, so you won't get any of the usual crazy hustle and bustle of SF. There's some outdoor seating, as well as tons of space inside!! The inside is SUPER HIP!! So nicely decorated, and it has a nice modern vibe!!My go-to drink orders:- 1/2 yerba mate, 1/2 chamomile, iced, medium creamy with almond milk and light sweet with honey- Iced Philtered Soul, straight upIt is the headquarters, so they test out new food items here. They had the ricotta & pistachio toast, which isn't something you can find at all the locations that serve food (not all locations have toast/food selections other than what you see in the bakery display case)!! The ricotta & pistachio toast was kinda missing something?? It was served on Starter Bakery bread and came with honey and sea salt, but it kinda lacked the flavor I was expecting?? It was tasty with a hint of sweet and salty that complemented each other nicely, but I think I'm going to stick to my usual: avocado toast with no eggThey had a creamy hazelnut toast on the menu, but I didn't see it in the display case, so I asked if they were still serving it, and the worker said they ran out of hazelnuts and that they stopped because it wasn't super popular :( I also saw a few energy bowl options!! Hella rad!!Bottom line: Love this location!! The workers are super friendly, and there's tons of space if you're looking for a place to work. I'm a HUGEEE sucker for those cute little hip local third wave coffee shops with ambiguous names that leave much room for interpretation (SF's specialty!!!!!!!), but Philz will always be #1 in my heart",5.0 star rating
"The consistency doesn't drop here, like all the other Philz in the area this place doesn't let you down for the perfect cup of coffee. All menu options are the same as the other locations and the coffee is always handmade by the delicious cup.

"Philz Coffee in dogpatch is a staple of this industrial neighborhood. The space has an open floor plan with high ceilings, well lit and plenty of workspace. It's typical to see several people working on their laptops and reading books at Philz. In addition to the wonderful workspace, wifi and kind staff members, the coffee is INCREDIBLE!!!!For the coffee snob that is into PURE black coffee, Philz will not disappoint the highly developed palate of yours. My go-to is Aromatic Arabic. A darker blend with tones of walnut and a smokiness to it. No cream, no sugar needed. Just a good cup of coffee to get the caffeine surge you need for work, and wonderful taste to keep your soul happy. In addition, the breakfast burritos, banana nut bread and complementary cucumber water are frosting on the wonderful (coffee) cake that is Philz. Bottom Line: Best coffee in San Francisco.",5.0 star rating
"Unfortunately and unnecessarily long process. Spent 15 minutes waiting on a small coffee and it wasn't busy.

"I was introduced to Philz this past week when I was visiting the Bay Area for work. I have travelled extensively both domestically and internationally, and I can confidently endorse Philz as one of the best coffees I have had . . . ever. Their extensive list of 20+ choices is more like a wine list than a coffee shop touting their one or two daily roasts. And with each cup individually ground and brewed when you order you always know you're getting a fresh cup. Staff are friendly, and I loved that they're not a bunch of coffee snobs. They simply brew world-class coffee. Enough said. If you've not yet tried Philz, you're missing a wonderful cup of joe. Enjoy!",5.0 star rating

"Quick Summary:- Recommend the Cafe Au Lait because one gets to personalize their coffee (you will see what I mean once you visit)- Unique coffee ordering experience- Cute decoration (the train caught my eye)- The aroma of roasted coffee beans is spectacular- We came at a right time, but a line grew while we were drinking coffee- More of a grab and go coffee place because of limited seating spaceWe were lured into the cafe by the cute coffee bean roasting train near the cafe entrance. Since we were looking for a place to sit down and drink some coffee, we decided to try here. I was first surprised and confused at the four different coffee dispensers at the area, where there are sugar and creams, and I later realized why. I ordered the cafe au lait and when the received my order, it was a cup filled with foamy milk. I probably looked dumbfounded because the cashier gestured and told me to pour coffee from the coffee dispensers. There were four different types (one being decaf), and I selected the darkest roast. The coffee was SO GOOD! My favorite type of coffee is the taste where it has no sour and bitter notes. The french roast didn't include any of these, and after I took a sip, it left a lingering toasty aftertaste. Even my relative, who can't drink coffee because they don't like the bitter taste, was able to drink a share. I was even tempted to purchase a bag of coffee beans, but that will be for the next visit.",5.0 star rating

He even walked over to me to offer me the wifi password, seeing that I took out my laptop (outside!). Super considerate and super good vibes.Beautiful environment with outdoor seating.

The space inside is a little cramped, the tables are kind of close to each other. The only downside is that there are no outlets to plug in anything, but there's free wifi!

"Wow.  I want to say my heartfelt thanks to the barista that turned my day around today.  Here's how my day started: I got a $76 parking ticket just 3 min after my meter ran out.  I even talked with the issuing officer and she was rigid as expected and wouldn't take back the ticket.  I was so furious I may have popped a vein or something!Then I had to make it to a visa appointment and literally sprinted to make it.  They asked for some silly documentation (like photocopy of the passport that they were holding in their hands!) that required me to go back in a couple of hours.  I decided to go to the UPS store next to Blue Bottle to print some docs.So as you can see I was in a very foul mood.Before I go to UPS, I decide to sit in Blue Bottle and organize some of the silly docs the embassy asked for. I walk into Blue Bottle and the barista asks me how I was.  I hesitated but needed a place to vent so I told him I was a little annoyed that I got a parking ticket.  He said he would take care of my drink and WAIVED THE COST OF MY DRINK!!  WOW.  I was so touched.  I immediately asked to break my $20 bill into 5s and tipped him a $5.Seriously, blue bottle, you guys are my new fave!! Thanks for the personal touch today.  And the barista who did this, I wish I asked your name.  Because what you did today really cheered me up and turned around what was a crappy and unproductive day.  You had the power and you used it so well.  Thank you!",5.0 star rating
"Drip coffee wasnt anything special but had a light aroma good for the morning, about $5.25 with tax. Nice seating inside good for studying or catching up with a friend. Not a large selection of pastries. There might be other choices that are better suited for coffee snobs in the area :)",3.0 star rating
"Blue bottle is great for coffee, tea, sandwiches, waffles, pastries and so much more. My friend and I stopped here for tea before exploring the area. We ordered at the register and picked up our drinks on the left hand side. I noticed they had lot of staff working at once but it's because they offer so many things on the menu. The girl that was working at the register was so nice! She greeted us the minute we came in and also made recommendations. She was also very polite. This is the type of customer service every restaurant needs to have.It only took us about 10 minutes to get our teas. We sat down at a table facing the street. I liked that this restaurant had an open layout with so much space. There were tables distributed across the restaurant and I loved that they weren't so close together. The restaurant was very clean and pretty much everything you'd want from a coffee shop. Additionally, I noticed that you could also buy some blue bottle branded goodies here such as cloth handbags and cups. Overall, my experience here was great. I loved everything about this location.",5.0 star rating

"I've been a fan of Blue Bottle since the first day I was introduced to the concept in the ferry building. I'm beyond pleased that a location has opened up on Fillmore! The pour over coffee is excellent. The baristas lost a star because during a visit they forgot to start my poor over order and it ended up taking 20 minutes for my coffee. (A smoother, systematic, operation process could help reduce the chance of this failure mode) Anyway, I'm also a fan of their cappuccinos, which, by the way, arrive looking like a work of art! They are almost too pretty to drink.The avocado toast is my special splurge treat. It's thick, avocado-y, and the sprinkling of magic spice salt tops it off in a divine way. Check out the cool gift sets available for purchase!",4.0 star rating
"I always enjoy my experience at Blue Bottle Coffee. They are everything to love when I seek coffee crafted with care, made with love and artistically finished. I go for my usual snickerdoodle and a latte when I go to a Blue Bottle Café. Although there are times when I do opt in for the Belgian wafel for the locations with this item in their pastry selection.I highly praise the staff for being friendly, delivering prompt and courteous service. The facility is always clean which provides a warm welcome to customers. Each location and every visit always finishes with a positive experience. I started going to Blue Bottle Coffee in 2012, first two visits were coffee beans purchase. First visit was in Hayes Valley, then the next two visits were at the Mint Plaza location. Upon the third visit, I dig into getting something to drink. I have been patronizing Blue Bottle Coffee ever since. Blue Bottle Coffee happens to be one of the coffee shops on the top of my go to list. The latte art I see is culinary creativity. Therefore, this is truly coffee that is really worth enjoying.One thing I always notice is the staff team's friendliness. They are polite and friendly, this comes with the warm greeting.Reasons for rating:- friendly staff- excellent service- clean, spacious facilityLooking to get a cup of coffee that is carefully crafted, made with love and artistically finished? Blue Bottle Coffee is your answer.I don't recall experiencing a super long wait. Sometimes there may be a line, but they do make it move fast. The work always get done fast and right. It is obviously notable that customer service at Blue Bottle Coffee is always on the mark for excellency. This is truly something that motivates me to patronize Blue Bottle Cafes. Props to dedication and excellent work.",5.0 star rating
"My family and I ended up coming here after a terrible experience trying to find the Mint St. location in San Francisco. Let's just say that we gave up after getting a ticket for accidentally driving in the bus/taxi lane.Man, there are too many signs in SF streets that you got to be on high alert if you want to even turn the corner.Anywho, after NOT even getting to step into a Blue Bottle AND getting a stupid ticket...we decided that either we would put off Blue Bottle for the rest of the day OR for another week...maybe even a month. BUMMER.As the day progressed and we celebrated our grandma's birthday, which was what we initially came to SF for that day, we discovered that there was another SF location that might be more convenient...Fillmore!The parking game, though still not the best, was much better near the Fillmore location (I don't want to emphasize the ""much better"" cause how much better can parking in SF get?).First off, the streets weren't as confusing as Mint St. Secondly, the walk down Fillmore St is a must for those visiting SF. There are so many little stores and eateries along the way. Note: The walk contains quite a few slopes, so I would advise those who might have difficulty with such walks to just drive.Back to Blue Bottle: The Blue Bottle on Fillmore is located on a street corner (it's quite visible). It's super clean and simple inside. There is absolutely no clutter, and there are light-colored wooden tables spread out in the vicinity. It's pretty bright inside both from the natural light coming through the windows as well as the artificial lights inside. Plus, they have a great selection of music (ahem...Lauryn Hill...Yuna...I repeat...GREAT).The menu, much like the place, is simple. There are a few varieties of drip coffees but everything else only has one option (e.g, there is just one ""caffe Latte"" or one ""caffe mocha""). We were discussing this, but it's interesting and great that although the quality of Blue Bottle Coffee is known for being excellent, the price for a cup of coffee doesn't differ much from that of chains like Starbucks or Peet's (except for the Affogato-ice cream in coffee...oh my gosh, I need to get this next time, but it's like 600 calories, and it is close to $6).I ordered the Caffe Latte (which came with a pretty design), and the best way I would describe it is that it is ""whole."" There was a deep taste (richness) without being overwhelming (thanks to both the froth and the quality of the Latte itself). I do think it had too much foam/creaminess on top-it took a little while to get to the liquid).I also got to try my sister's Cascara Fizz (a lemony-sweet soda). Wow, I really enjoyed it. It had just the right amount of sweetness and tartness. Even the sparkling water they used was not harsh on the throat (a more diluted version)? It was a bit pricy for the $4ish we paid though. Without the ice cubes, the drink probably amounted to less than 8 oz.The customer service was okay. The guys were professional in that they answered our questions and got our drinks right, but it was decent-no complaints. They did their job without any frills. Anyways, my experience at Blue Bottle (and the adventure getting there) was a memorable one. So here's four stars!",4.0 star rating

"*8/6 Update*: Added a star because of a kind note from the manager regarding my experience.A respectable coffee shop at the corner of Fillmore and Jackson. The interior decor was contemporary and felt comfortable. The New Orleans iced coffee was quite good. 3-stars are for the amenities and atmosphere inside. Ever since Blue Bottle Coffee was acquired by Nestle for $700M, I've wanted to swing by to see what this new concept was about. This was my first Blue Bottle experience because I happened to be in the neighborhood. I did not come with high expectations. My thinking was that unless you're a coffee connoisseur, you would likely miss the hype train that everyone else had been on. I was gladly proven wrong regarding this point. The iced-coffee here was noticeably better than any other iced I've had in a while. The perfect amount of sweetness with a smooth finish. I was very happy with this order. The location itself leaves a bit to be wanting. There was no WiFi (!) in the shop. I understand faster table turnover is an important business metric, but this may be trying a little too hard. The baristas sometimes don't seem to have that much attention to detail either. I was sitting next to a table of empty mugs with some liquid spilled on it. The barista came over, took away the mugs, and didn't look back at wiping the stain. 3/5.",4.0 star rating
"Disclaimer: non-coffee drinker here.But when I first noticed that blue bottle was opening in the neighborhood, all I could think of was ""open, open, open!""Sure, call me a groupie, but I can't resist jumping on the third wave coffee bandwagon. Granted, the cheapest cup of Joe is $3.75 (Single origin, made one cup at a time, yadda, yadda) and their TCHO laced mocha drink clocks in at $4.75, BB is pricey. And of course, when the barista smiles at you, that's an least an extra $1! I usually get a decaf Americano or decaf iced latte (decaf -- A waste of time AND money! don't do it!) i try it first without putting all that garbage (sugar and milk) and declare it delicious. But then, I can't handle the bitter taste so I augment my coffee to the point that my $3.75 cup tastes like a sugary mess. AAAHHHH. Like I said, non-coffee drinker here. I should just stick to their iced cascara fizz next time.",4.0 star rating

"Cashier who took order was not friendly. Cappuccino is served in a small cup. Way too much milk for a cap. With the amount of milk they included, coffee was too milky and tasted more like a latte.

It's over priced but taste of coffee was good simply too much milk for a cap. Might go back to try a dry cap but for an everyday spot. I don't mind paying a high price but would expect a delicious true cap not a mini petite latte.",3.0 star rating
"I've never had a bad experience at a Blue bottle before until now :/ I wasn't too impressed with their service today. I ordered a NOLA and an iced latte and they messed up my order.

It didn't taste the same and the chicory was overpowering. Not the best blue bottle cafe and they need to work out the kinks in their communication.",3.0 star rating
"REVIEWER # 12I've experienced the Blue Bottle Coffee near Market and near the Twitter Building; for the most part, I enjoy it and love that the space is always kept clean. Customer service is always flawless, and everyone is very accommodating.  I was happy to see that another Blue Bottle Coffee opened right in the Fillmore area, trust me-it is needed. I'm sure many people get tired of seeing the same ol' Pete's Coffee and Starbucks. Blue Bottle Coffee makes drinking coffee more exciting. This new location recently opened in June 2017 and has everyone excited over the grand opening. As from what I notice, there are no discounts or specials happening. The location is very spacious and as of now, there is no signage located outside indicating the name of the business or announcing the grand opening. I literally only found out because I walked pasted it during the Fillmore Festival. The interior of this location is different from other locations. There is natural light that comes through the windows, but it reminds me of a retail store. It's not as welcoming as I would expect. I love that this location serves the Waffle and Avocado Toast! OMG, you must try one if you are here! Overall, a great place to stop for the coffee feens. It's much tastier then the normal Starbucks and Peet's Coffee.",4.0 star rating
"So excited about having a Blue Bottle in the neighborhood. So excited in fact that I went there twice in one day. There's a saying in German that literally translates to ""it's hard to stand on one only leg"" and figuratively serves as the justification for the second beer/wine/jello shot. I believe this also very true for coffee in general and the Blue Bottle New Orleans in particular. I've been raving about this one on several other occasions/locations throughout the city, and the lovestory continues in the Pac Heights location. Creamy, icy, lightly sweet deliciousness in a glass! More to love about this location: spacious interior, pretty minimalistic, but not too cool. Waffles and Avocado toast on the menu. Lots of coffee gear to check out and wonder about how great they would look in your own kitchen. And of course all the different grinds and blends for your own coffee maker of choice. I like the little packages that serve 1, great to try different blends without committing to a whole bag. Chances are high that you'll find me here more often than my wallet allows.",5.0 star rating

"So thrilled to see a new coffee spot open up right by my morning bus stop, but I questioned how good it'd really be. It is flippin' DELICIOUS!!! Having been back at least 3x in the week, I can confidently say they serve one of the best vanilla lattes I have had to date (the whole milk one was best, but nonfat milk works well for more frequent latte fixes). The pastries are from Craftsman and Wolves and perfectly pair with the caffeinated beverage of your choice. My fav so far? The apple cider cake donut. Last time I popped in, I noticed a breakfast menu (they also have lunch-y foods like avo toast)- will need to try out something the next morning I'm there.",5.0 star rating

They have a selection of pastries that look quite nice including kouign amanns, and a variety of coffees. Unfortunately there weren't too many options for non-coffee drinkers like myself, and the prices were a bit on the expensive side (most coffees were around $4, shakes were $7-8, and pastries were $4-5).

"One of our favorite coffee places!! They originally started in SoCal. LA to be exact! Everytime we were in LA, we would make it a point to stop in. They've recently opened here in SF (Franklin St). Soon to have another location in the Mission. This is going to sound funny (and I happen to be severely lactose intolerant). My very first time at Klatch, I ordered a mocha shake. Back then, pat milk was just starting to hype up, and I saw they had oat milk on their choices of milk. Me getting too excited, I told the lady I wanted a mocha shake with Oat Milk. She looked at me kinda funny and started to explain that their shakes are made with ice cream that contains dairy....I thought for a second, and said, what the heck! Let's make it anyway! She smiled and said ok!! That was the start of the love life between oat milk and mocha shake at Klatch!!! Lactose intolerant or not, best mocha shake ever!!! At this location, they serve pastries from Craftsman and Wolves, another one of my favorite places!! Come to Klatch Coffee for some really good coffee. Oh hubby loves their cold brew as well!

The coffee is very expensive ($6.50 for an iced coffee with milk) and I went back wanting a plain iced coffee and they were out of cold brew (coffee shop doesn't have coffee?) so they offered me an alternative, nitro brew, for a dollar extra ($5). The first thing I noticed was it was sour. Upon notifying the barista, she assured me this was the intended flavor of the coffee (I trust her if she said it was, but I personally don't enjoy sour coffee, maybe that's just me).

"I've been here a few times, and don't think its worth it. The tea is good, but if you're Asian, you know how to make better tea at home.The food is solid, but not something I'd go out of my way for.That leaves the experience... the decor and ambience both indoors and outdoors is hard to beat, but I've been here twice for lunch on a weekday almost 12 months apart and both times I sat for over 60 minutes before my food came out. The first time, I had to get a few items boxed and left early, and yesterday, my group was about 5 minutes away from it.I understand long waits for full service complicated food, but the sandwiches and bowls on the menu hardly warrant it.I'd really suggest to management that they find some sort of appetizers that they can make in less than 30 minutes,  and consider serving them in larger quantities,  or put out complementary table crackers.  Waits are fine, but not if you sit for 30 minutes before even appetizers and tea even come out (literally we sat there for 30+ minutes... )",3.0 star rating
"I love the location of Samovar and the food and drinks are pretty good, but I'm growing frustrated by the deceptive pricing and hidden fees.First, I have found on three different occasions that the price on my receipt was higher than the price on the menu.  For instance, the Cold Brew Matcha is $7 on the menu, but is $8 on the bill.  They are always shocked when I highlight these discrepancies and only fix it with a one-time discount on the bill - they don't seem to fix the POS.Second, they charge an ""SF Employer Mandate,"" as so many restaurants do.  As you hopefully know now, this is not a real tax and restaurants charge an arbitrary amount to cover costs to comply with the new law requiring businesses with over 20 employees to provide healthcare for employees. Samovar charges 5% of the bill, which is far more than would be required to comply with the $1.89 per employee hour for healthcare.Third, they now also charge an additional mysterious ""Back of House Service Fee"" which is 4% of the total bill. It's unclear what this money goes towards, but presumably compensation for the cooks and cleaning staff.  But shouldn't that come out of the revenues? Or the tip?Don't get me wrong - I'm strongly supportive of increasing the wages for restaurant workers. But I would much prefer that the restaurant raise prices than add these hidden charges to the menu. And charging more on the bill than the menu for items is just unethical and illegal.",2.0 star rating
"Samovar once was a great tea shop near Dolores park. Like so much of post tech sf, it's gone way down in quality and way up in prices. Today - the final straw - I come to a nearly empty place and am told I can't sit for tea until my friend arrives! Sabrina was very nice, and said it was what she was trained to do. I was quite bothered but take her at her word that Jesse (the owner though she didn't mention his name) must have wanted that. Some of the tea is still very good like the blood orange puer and  the incomparable green ecstasy (sencha snd matcha). But even that has gone downhill from the original preparation and now quite bitter. If you buy the tea leaves, the instructions are often way wrong - like the green ecstasy should be cold brewed then ten seconds in 185 water - not two minutes boiling! The tempeh is great fir vegetarian but sickly sweet. Other nice dishes are the Japanese tea service. Once the tech bubble bursts, I imagine the shop will regroup and go back to its previous quality. In the meantime, buy Japanese tea as asakichi in Japan town. The matcha is much cheaper and much better. I buy the very best orange dot but it's the priciest. Jesse, please bring back the old samovar standards",2.0 star rating
"One of the prettiest cafes/brunch places I've been to in SF! The food is unique and delicious as well. Perfect for a not-so-heavy brunch on a nice day.I came here on Sunday at noon and there weren't that many people there so we got seated right away. The restaurant has massive windows with a lot of sunlight and super nicely decorated. The staff were all really nice and attentive. We got the duck & egg jook, the smoked duck hash, the chia seed pudding, and the chai. The smoked duck they use in the jook and hash is so good, and I'm not even a fan of duck, but it was like bacon but better and not oily. I might try something else when I go next time though, because I wasn't like coo coo for coco puffs for the jook or hash. The chia seed pudding and chai were amazing though - definitely will get those every time I go.This is a great place for conversation over a casual brunch where you don't have to wait in crazy long lines.

"The sparkling matcha limeade was a beautiful, unexpected explosion of complex flavor in a drink that's made of seemingly contradictory components. The sparkling limeade component towards the top of the drink gives a very refreshing and cool taste, whereas the heavier matcha component that sinks to the bottom provides a sweet, earthy, and full contrast. Beautifully crafted tea cocktail. The building is very pretty with lots of natural light as well. The service could be improved, and the prices could be lower.",4.0 star rating
"This location of the samovar tea bar has a beautiful interior and exterior with open space, high ceilings, natural light and plants. This is a good place for afternoon tea if you want to get together with friends or if you want a relaxing place to study/get work done. The food and tea were pretty disappointing. I got the earl grey tea smoked chicken sandwich and I couldn't taste the earl grey tea at all. The the chicken salad was very salty and there was nothing too special about it. I wouldn't recommend this sandwich. I also got the vintage 2009 tea which was $15. The description of the tea was ""dark chocolate, caramel, pecan pie"" so I thought the tea would be sweet. It is definitely not a sweet tea. It tasted more like an herbal tea if anything. So if you want a sweet tea, I suggest trying something else!

"Overall, I'm disappointed in the service my friends and I received while dining here for Sunday brunch. First, when I asked what was vegan on the menu. The waitress just mentioned the sandwich and nothing else, which didn't give me many options. Then after ordering, I was served a cold tea when I asked for it hot, and the waitress snapped at me when I asked about getting the hot version, saying that was why she asked me if I wanted iced or hot. I'm 100% sure I said hot when she asked for clarification and my friends agree. When my friends asked for more butter for their toast, it took quite a while before it came.The whole time I felt very unwelcome dining here, which is very unfortunate since we were looking forward to the event. I had heard that the place is pretty vegan friendly but I'd say the options are pretty minimal. None of the brunch menu was vegan I think. Some vegan options were labeled as vegetarian (I had to ask for clarification), which was pretty confusing. I appreciate that the menu has pretty healthy options with simple ingredients and that there are many tea options for tea-lovers. If I ever go back again, I hope the service can be improved and the menu can consider adding some more creative vegan options!",2.0 star rating

We ordered the duck reuben, the salmon bowl ( we were going to get the jook but they sold out! ), the squash potstickers, mochi cakes, and the chia pudding. The food is simple, but Samovar delivers what is promised flawlessly and full of interesting flavors.The tea was delicious as well although I wish there was an option for tea flights so that we could have tried a larger variation. At the end of the meal we were stuffed and the bill came out to a little less than $100 including drinks. Definitely a solid spot in my book and I'm really excited to have an excuse to come back.",5.0 star rating
Absolutely amazing. Came into the city to do some shopping but wanted something to eat first. Stumbled upon this place and decided to give it a try. Decor and atmosphere is so cozy and has an amazing view of downtown SF. Started with a chardonnay and Maiden's Ecstasy. Everything we ordered tasted amazing. - Butternut Squash Platter- Grilled Duck Reuben- Salmon Egg Bowl- Chia Pudding - Mochi PlatterDefinitely Recommend and will be back to try the Jook!-B,5.0 star rating
"I had this place on my list of go-to places for awhile but to be completely honest, this was not my best restaurant situation, here is the breakdown:Service (2.5/5): When we were seated it took some time before we actually got any menus - we had to call a waiter over to ask for menus because had waited so long and were quite hungry. Things were also a bit rushed when it came to ordering and paying the bill. We were given the check before I even finished half of my tea and I didn't understand the rush because there was no line and plenty of open tables. So yeah, service wasn't great and our waiter didn't really check up on us. Food (3/5): Presentation-wise, the food looked great. I ordered the Jook with duck and eggs, because I had seen other order it on Yelp and was excited to get some flavorful duck and rice porridge. However, I found the dish to be quite bland. There wasn't much seasoning in the porridge (even with the addition of the sauce on the side) and the duck. My friends got the smoked duck hash and eggs benefits and also said that their food was underseasoned. So overall the food was underwhelming. Drinks (4/5): I got the velvet cacao because the tea I was originally going to get (a blood orange flavored one) was out and the waiter recommended this. It was fine - a bit bitter towards the end if you let the leaves soak too long. It had a nice faint cacao taste but it wasn't anything mind-blowing good. Setting (4/5): The space was nice and well lit. There was plenty of seating with both indoors and out.",3.0 star rating
"Ok I love the location of Samovar, the look of Samovar and its setup. I also love the variety of teas that Samovar has and appreciate that they pair the teas with meals. BUT I think the value of the food is not worth the price at all. My SO and I ordered the California rose and Japanese sencha teas and enjoyed the teas very much. However, the potstickers, vegan roll and sandwich were underwhelming in both flavor and capacity. Of course, the lightness of the food goes well with tea-- you want smaller foods to truly appreciate the taste and texture of the tea. But I just don't get the pricing or the value of it. I'd come back for the tea for sure, but probably eat elsewhere.",3.0 star rating
A good place to go for tea service with the big floor to ceiling window panes. (Plus they allow reservations for tea time which is a bonus).A lot of natural lighting for good photos!Food itself was pretty decent and tea was good too.I had the squash dumplings with veggie/duck stir fry and blood orange puer tea. Service was also good.,4.0 star rating
"Catching up with friends is always better with a yummy brunch! So glad they had vegan options! I had a veggie sandwich and indulged in some yummy treats to share! The tea selection was honestly overwhelming but the staff seemed very knowledgeable when we asked about the different teas! The atmosphere was absolutely gorgeous!! Since there's mostly windows the lighting is amazing for picture taking! All in all, I would definitely get brunch here again and can't wait to try the different teas off the menu!",5.0 star rating
"Arrived with a friend around lunch time on a Saturday during President's Day weekend. Surprisingly there was no wait! | v i b e |Located in the BEAUTIFUL Yerba Buena Gardens. I love the big windows because it allows so much natural light into the restaurant. The restaurant was smaller than I expected, but there is a lot of seating both inside and outside. The decor is minimalistic and clean, and even though it looks super fancy, the vibe is actually pretty casual.| m e n u |FYI: Brunch menu is served until 2pm. Here's what we ordered:1. Smoked duck & egg jook ($15): hit the spot because my friend and I wanted something comforting and warm. The porridge is thick, and I enjoyed the toppings it came with. The rice porridge itself is unseasoned; it's served with soy sauce and sriracha. I did sprinkle a little bit of soy sauce in but wouldn't have minded it unseasoned. 2. Salmon + egg bowl ($13): This too was unseasoned and came with soy sauce to add in. We added some avocado too. I recommend drizzling some in to add more flavor to the salmon. Good if you're in the mood for something clean and healthy. Don't know if it was worth the price. 3. Iced matcha latte ($6): Ordered with almond milk. Super refreshing! Comes UNSWEETENED. 4. Tart peach tea ($10): Comes in a lil teapot with a little tea cup. So cute. The tea itself is light with a hint of peach. You can drink it with milk and sugar, but we prefer our teas straight. | t l ; d r |Very cute and aesthetically-pleasing restaurant that serves wide variety of high-quality teas and solid food! Definitely worth a visit, and while you're there, take a stroll through the park as well.",4.0 star rating

"I have had this place on my go to list for a while, and I finally made it here today. Absolutely impressed with the location, view, service, and wide array of exquisite tea types and nibble options to go with it. MENUIf you have been working up an appetite, you can opt for one of the full tea service packages - English, Japanese, Chinese etc. They all come with tea options and some decent sized food portions to go with. I wasn't too hungry when we got here, so I went for a Cranberry eucalyptus tea pot and we shared a sweets platter. The Sweets platter  included, mochi cakes, chia pudding and dates stuffed with goat cheese with a hint of mint. Amongst the nibbles, the dates were outstanding and everything else while not outstanding was definitely delicious. Since, we were four of us I also had a chance to try the peach tea and the matcha latte. The matcha latte is unsweetened, which I liked, but you can add a sweetener of your choice if you prefer a sweeter option. The peach tea was phenomenal too.AMBIENCE We went on a day when it was drizzling, so it was beautiful to sit at one of the tables next to the window pane watching the drizzle while sipping on hot tea.SERVICEThe staff was friendly and prompt. I am definitely going here again.",5.0 star rating
"I've lived a couple blocks away for months now and finally tried Karma last week. I'm so mad at myself for not coming sooner!The cafe has a great ambiance- two floors, plenty of comfy chairs and little nooks to hang out/read/do work in, and beautiful decor. The cafe is warm on chilly days. They offer water infused with lemon, cucumber, and ginger!I've only had a chai and a pesto panino here.... but both were great and I'm looking forward to exploring more of their menu while I work here. The weekdays are not bad at all, pretty quiet, and there's usually good music and a dog hanging out to perk up your day.",5.0 star rating
"ONE OF MY MOST FAVORITE CAFE SO FAR!This is a 2-story local cafe in the corner of the street. When I first walked in I saw the sign 'GOOD VIBE ONLY.' I knew suddenly I was in the right place. On the wall of the first floor, you will see tons of dogs' pictures frame hanging on the wall. These are all the dogs that have visited this cafe. I love everyone who takes dogs seriously lol There are so many food and beverage selections. When I ordered my iced mocha, he asked specifically how I wanted. I love dark mocha and that was just exactly what I needed. IT'S JUST RIGHT. You can enjoy the lively vibe downstairs or walk to the second floor where you will see a huge lovely octopus on the wall. You can peacefully work on your project quietly there.Will definitely come back next time I visit San Fran!!",5.0 star rating
"I don't know what it is, but their bread tastes like soap/cleaner. So far I tried their banana bread and focaccia bread (two weeks apart) and they both had the same soapy/cleaner taste. At first I thought it was a specific ingredient, but now that I see BOTH the items taste like it, unsure what it is.Ambiance is cute and laid back, a beautiful cafe.

Feeling healthy but wanting something delicious? Well karma cafe is the place to go! All the drinks here are absolutely delicious! A bit on the pricey side ($7.50 for a smoothie...?!) but understandable because of the ingredients used. One of my favorite drinks here is the lavender lemonade. The floral crisp taste is perfect for a nice sunny hot day. It's refreshing and delicious! The mango avocado smoothie is very subtle in flavors but it does make me feel super full after drinking half of this. They had samples of their PB&J and this was amazing. It felt like I was eating a PB&J sandwich without the heavy carbs. Can't wait to try the other items on the menu. Highly recommend for the drinks. And who doesn't love the cute puppy running around. This deserves 5 stars on its own!!,5.0 star rating
I love it already! Got a little excited and ordered double drinks this morning: the golden gate smoothie and house coffee. Finally that corner is serving good coffee!

"A very cool cafe decorated in a very charming manner, with upstairs and downstairs seating  and featuring breakfast selections,  lunch options, snacks, smoothies, coffee and espresso drinks and fresh juices...  The proprietor is a culinary school graduate who is personally responsible for most it not all of the food offerings and who has otherwise placed her personal stamp on all aspects of the cafe's operation.  A great place for a meeting or date if in the area.",5.0 star rating
"Cute Cafe in a residential area, plenty of people hunkered down to work for the day and it's a comfortable environment so I can see why. The smoothie I had was good, might not be worth going way out of your way for but the ingredients were fresh and it was served with a smile.",4.0 star rating
"There are few coffee places that can really amaze captivate, and astound. Karma Cafe is one of these. They create a unique ambiance that's situated in a quaint and quiet neighborhood.

"I am a very very picky coffee drinker. I'm a borderline coffee snob. I love Henry's place.The coffee here is always hot and tasty as heck. They roast on site so you know the quality and the freshness is top-notch. I can't say enough about the staff that work here. I am very demanding on service, and the staff here never lets me down.

"My friend had told me that this place had really good chai so I came to try. I got: -Chai latte: While the chai was flavorful, it was too sweet for me - that the first thing I tasted was the cane sugar and then the chai. -Croissant: ehh, very buttery and flakey but didn't really have a body.-Pour over: YES get the pour-over. I hear the Bella is really good and the barista told me that his favorite was the Conquistador. I ended up getting the Thailand which was described as nutty and smooth. For me, it wasn't so nutty, but indeed very smooth with a subtle citrus tone and chocolate finish.",4.0 star rating

Finally I got to Stop by last weekend right before going to the Golden Gate Park for a walk. I tried the cappuccino and loved it. Delicious coffee and danishes. Everything we got was good and fresh. I noticed a lot of locals coming in for to go coffee and hanging out at the shop for conversations. Loved the atmosphere. Friendly staff and neighborhood.

"Henry's is pretty close to where I live and they just recently remodeled their coffee shop. I needed some coffee in the morning and decided to get some Espresso from here. I came on a Wednesday and there were people outside chatting and people inside doing work. The cashiers were friendly and the Espresso was great. For $2.50, it's a steal! The prices here are really reasonable and I was in and out in like a minute. They do accept Apple Pay here which is really convenient for me. I believe they also roast their own coffee on site and you can smell the great coffee aroma once you enter. I like Henry's because street parking is easy to find and I can get a jump on my day pretty fast. But if you want to sit, they also have that option and have pastries and breakfast items for you to enjoy.",4.0 star rating
"My favorite coffee that I get delivered to Alaska. Armenian coffee is a must, with that extra fine grind. I also like the Bella coffee, rich and chocolaty dark. I've ordered for Christmas gifts from here, and I received my package 4 days after ordering it. That was fast, so I gave it to them to enjoy early this year! If I make to San Francisco I will definitely stop in.This is my 1000th review, and it's so worth it to spend it on reviewing this place.P.S.

"I came in for the first time on a late Monday afternoon and the shop was pretty empty, though I noticed quite a few people stopped in for togo orders. It's a cute spot and though I didn't test out the wifi, just based on table size and the volume level that day I think it'd be a good place to study or get some work done. I ordered a small mocha (hot) and really enjoyed it! The drink wasn't too bitter nor too sweet - it was honestly just right and definitely one of the better mochas I've had. On top of that, in comparison to other nearby coffee shops, the prices here are a bit lower which is great because coffee spending definitely adds up. Service was also really friendly!",5.0 star rating

"I honestly don't understand how this place gets such great reviews. Just went and had a mediocre cappuccino (at best) and the driest bagel. They have no fresh produce to put on the bagel which is questionable.

"I start my day by drinking a cup of Armenian coffee everyday and also a few more shots of Armenian coffee throughout the day! I have tried several different Armenian coffee in Los Angels but I have to admit none of those can beat Henry's house dark roast Armenian coffee! Two of my friends recommended Henry's House Coffee and I was very interested to give it a try. I checked their website and ordered half n half Armenian coffee and Dark Armenian coffee. Confessing that Henry's House Coffee is an expensive coffee, $17 for for a pack of coffee, it's kinda pricey; but worth giving it a try! The taste of dark one is pleasurably wonderful. Flavors that I am getting out of Henry's coffee are rich, fragrant, and blissfully smooth; even though it is dark but it's very smooth and no bitter taste (for Armenian coffee drinkers). Henry's House coffee takes the daily coffee ritual to a new heights. I highly recommend it!",5.0 star rating
Such an awesome place! We came here from downtown SF using the bus which seemed longer than it probably was (next time i plan on just driving). The coffee was exceptional!

"We've been on the hunt for a good, third wave coffee shop to buy our beans from and we've finally found it~ Beans from Philz' for example lack quality -- they don't even have the roast dates on the bag and are just mass produced to cater to the hype. And many of the shops in SF overprice their beans or advertise a pound when they really sell it in 10-12oz quantities, lame. But behold!! We loved the beans we got from here AND it's actually a full 16ozThe female cashier was really informative about the pour overs and helped us picked 2 different ones, both of which we loved. We ended up getting a bag of their Gypsy(?) bean and have been doing our own pour overs at home. I'm wondering if our ratio is right though, we'll definitely need to ask next time. Also! Each bag purchase comes with a free brewed coffee I believe. The shop itself is small but we were lucky to grab 2 seats, they also have a variety of coffee gear to sellExcited to stop by again in a couple weeks to try a new bean~",4.0 star rating
"Wow, would not normally review for a single visit, but the latte was remarkable. I like to judge a place on how it handles basics -- in coffee shops, I try espressos, lattes, cold brews... The latte here is excellent! I would definitely come back to try their other drinks if I'm ever in the neighborhood again.I really appreciate the vibe of the store as well.

Which i wasn't opposed to since all the coffee shops in my area are chains.The menu is easy and simple. I ordered a Medium Mocha. It was very pleasant, perfect blend of cocoa and coffee. Some places just cannot get it right. My friend went for the cold brew and also tasted great.Love that it's a family run shop. I read more on their website about how they got started and I think it's great that father and son are working together on this. I heard it's newly renovated.

"I walked by this bakery on my way to the hair salon Saturday morning and figured I would stop for a quick breakfast since I was early for my appointment and the line inside implied it was a decent bakery. :PThe smell, once I got inside, was phenomenal and the selection of savory and sweet pastries was enough to make me salivate. I ended up getting just a savory croissant (ham and cheese, I believe) and a house coffee to go, but it was reaaalllly tough to harness my self control! I mean..what can't I use a whole loaf of bread for? Anyway, I'm not sure what they brew, but their drip coffee is quite good!

"Ive always heard the third time is the charm. On my personal tour de San Francisco almond croissants, looks like we have struck gold(Hoping someone catches the history reference here). The exposed brick, the rustic furniture...its likehome n Country magazine come to life. Parking is somewhat of a challenge(yes some people actually drive around here), but it's so worth the struggle! Thorough bread and bakery is a picturesque cafe featuring mostly French inspired pastries and freshly baked breads. There are also lunch items like salads and sandwiches.Almond croissant - super flaky, buttery, and straight up delicious. The almond filling is not too sweet, featured inside the croissant, and brace yourself for this one...ON TOP of the croissant. Let's marinate on that for a few seconds....Ham and cheese croissant - again with the buttery flakiness. I have no idea what the filling is, but it's certainly not simply ham and cheese. I would guess some sort of bechamel? Either way, simply delicious! San Fran is loaded with world class bakeries, but with Thorough, Ive landed on my favorite thus far.

"If you're looking for a good cup of coffee, some lovely pastries and an amazing backdoor patio then this is a great choice! Before I get too far into this review I should note, it was not written from the location as they don't offer free wifi. Kinda strange for a coffee shop but, hey maybe they don't want people overstaying their welcome :) Anyway, I ordered a tall cup of joe (drip coffee) and a plain croissant. The coffee was tasty and the croissant was above average, not spectacular. I will say that the other pastries in the case looked delicious and the baked bread was on point. The best part of the space was the backyard garden area. It's peaceful, well lit and are tough to come by in SF. My advice...grab a coffee, disconnect and enjoy the scenery.",4.0 star rating
"My husband gets a loaf of fresh bread wherever he can and this was his favorite loaf of bread ever, including what we've gotten at farmer's markets, acme, whole foods, etc. It's surprising this place doesn't have more of a wait since we waited in line on the same day at Tartine forever and thought the pastries and bread here were much better!They have a cute little cafe garden in the back too.",5.0 star rating
"Ok, I just read this one review before I'm starting my own review of this place & I'm unpleasantly surprised to learn that they use day old croissants to make their almond croissants? Why?I've visited this place twice while I'm currently working in the area, and I think both visits were good. The pastries that I got were pretty yummy. 1st time I got the Almond Croissant & The Rustic in which I liked the Rustic more. Then 2nd time I got a Mocha, The Rustic, and Apple Frittata (?) in which I liked the Apple one more because it reminds me kinda like an apple pie. Overall this place is pretty rusticly cute, and it's cool they have a patio/backyard area for people to enjoy their pastry & coffee.",3.0 star rating
"I have not reviewed this place... How is this possible? First of all, they have the best ham and cheese croissants that I've ever tried, and Lord knows I've tried a lot (including wonderful ones in Paris and Buenos Aires). Do yourself a favor and have some, warmed up. Their carrot cake is divine, as well as their cream puffs, and everything else on display looks wonderful. Their coffee is always delicious and unassuming, this isn't Starbucks after all. Oh! Their almond croissanttttt. Get some of that and thank me later.I've always wanted to sit in their back patio and read a book, but it would appear that I'm not the only person who's had that idea. Every time I have gone it's booked to capacity. Highly recommend this bakery. It makes me and the husband happy and we always stop by when in Castro, once a month. Love!",5.0 star rating
"Many weeks later, I'm still dreaming of the savory scone I spontaneously got at Thorough Bread. You see, I usually find scones dry and tasteless, but there was something about this one that called my name. It made me want to give more scones a chance. (Or maybe I should continue to eat Thorough Bread scones only.)The space inside is pleasant. It's nice to be able to sit close to where the magic happens, and the display of breads and pastries is very inviting.There's an outside patio in the back that has almost as much seating as inside. It feels like a nice oasis in the middle of SF.",4.0 star rating

The texture was perfect, the base of the cookie had a nice flavor, and the chocolate chips were gooey and perfect. Totally recommend this place.",5.0 star rating

I don't know what is going on with all these hipster coffee shops that want to work with office hours instead of hospitality hours. Good way to do business guys. The coffee is over priced and just regular taste. The bathroom is a tech nightmare.

"Stanza is such a cute little coffee shop! The music isn't too loud, the bathroom is extremely clean (very futuristic, as many other reviewers have mentioned), and is a great place to come get some work down. The tables are big and there's plenty of seats. I ordered an iced latte, and it was perfectly creamy - maybe one of the best lattes I've ever had! The only downfall is the lack of outlets at this place. One of the walls has maybe 3 outlets, while the other wall only has 1 outlet. Make sure to bring a long extension if you come here!",5.0 star rating
"When I think of Stanza, I tend to consider it my secondary option for coffee if I'm in that part of the Mission. There are a lot of excellent cafes and coffee vendors in the area, and comparing Stanza to the wealth of other options makes me think it's just all right. For example, if you are looking for a workspace, the limited seating options and dim lighting makes this place not so inviting to write or read for a long time (I guess an exception would be if you are a cave dweller or a vampire who has foolishly ventured out in the daytime and need a safe space to hide out from the sun). However, the coffee is great, and I usually get my drink to go given the space limitations. My most recent drink was a cortado, and I thought it was well-made; Americanos here have also not disappointed. However, Four Barrel would probably be my preferred coffee option if I'm in the area.",3.0 star rating

"This place was A-OK, we were looking for coffee and of course, why not go to an amazing stand alone vs a Sbux if you can? The ordering was easy enough, we walked in and got a cold brew. They immediately brewed up and we got it quickly. I wish I had gotten their amazing looking cookies, specifically the half pb and half chocolate but next time. I took one star off because while the coffee was good it was slightly too acidic for my taste. We sat on their patio which was nice and had a beautiful wall mural but was ridden with a ton of flies. Overall, A-OK.",3.0 star rating
"I love the chill vibes that this coffee shop emits. There is relaxing music played in the background (albeit a bit loud and you can clearly hear it even with earphones on unless you have the noise cancelling headphones). The lighting is slightly dim and conveys an intimate setting.  There are outlets on the wall and many people come here to work on their laptops. The interior design of this place is also phenomenal. Very detailed and meticulous, ornate designs placed on the walls. Love it!I ordered the thai iced tea, which was alright. It wasn't very sweet or milky, two things I would have preferred. My boyfriend ordered the cold brew and said it wasn't acidic at all. He thought the drink was particularly good here. (Sidenote: the bathroom here is really modern, cool, and clean)",4.0 star rating
"Excellent coffee beverages and service!  Luis was extremely friendly, attentive and eager to provide high quality customer service.  It is nice to see someone who seems happy to be at work!  Lina made our lattes and we watched as she carefully and diligently craft not only delicious but artistic beverages!  She appeared to put great care into ensuring that we were happy with our order and we appreciated the service with a smile.  The facilities were very clean and the atmosphere was welcoming and relaxing. My party of six took a table in the sunny, clean patio and were able to order food from Pork Store Cafe next door; the food was wonderful too.  Everything we ordered tasted very fresh and flavorful, and I saw many menu items that I would like to come back and try at another time!  Prices are very reasonable for the quality and amount of food you get (and I have a large appetite).  The owner came to greet us and check on us several times, which was nice.  All in all, this was a great first time experience here and everyone in my party is planning on another visit soon! Thank you for a lovely Saturday morning brunch with great food, beverages, customer service and atmosphere!",5.0 star rating
"A great coffee shop to catch up on work or friends. Their prices were a bit high. On a Saturday afternoon we were looking forward on sitting out on the patio after ordering our drinks, but it was completely packed. Found a table inside to settle into.

It would be a great place to catch up with a friend or do a little bit of work - the environment is perfect and relaxed. Highly recommended!",5.0 star rating

Once inside, the entire bathroom is hands free, including a sensor to open the door on your way out. Very clean.",5.0 star rating
"Expensive but quality ingredients, you can definitely taste the tea in their iced team, nothing artificial here! The interior of the cafe is pretty dark, so is the front patio, so if you're wanting to work/study somewhere comfortably for a long period of time, can't say this is ideal. They do have long tables though in case you needed to spread out and it never got super busy, so you didn't feel guilty for staying a little while. The back patio was absolutely gorgeous though and felt like it was a completely different space - it gets the best sunlight, is warm and cozy, and is beautifully designed. That was probably the only space that stayed consistently busy and full. Super nice service though.",3.0 star rating
"What a nice find in the city! Perfect spot to get some work done outside of the house. They have a good amount of seating with many people sharing tables. Also, super fast wifi that connected in a cinch. I tried some of the Thai Tea and the Waffle, which were both very yummy.",4.0 star rating

"Who needs a rebel within when you can be a bear without? There are far too many ways to enjoy a soft boiled egg than hidden inside a muffin. But a nice travel cake or cocoa nib financier in sizes petite enough for a baby bear? That's a good deal at $4 each. Add on a green oolong tea and there is even room for a $9 green pill pastry from the glass case with lime leaf custard, mango cream, and vanilla for later. Is it America's Best $15 Road Trip Adventure Meal? A burger and beer at Black Sands Brewery in the Lower Haight might be better. If it's after 11am. But for earlier hours, tea, travel cake, and a pill for the road just might make a nice runner up. Why let wolves and rebels have all the fun? Put the bear in the Bear Republic by opting out of the soft boiled muffin mayhem. Tea and tiny cakes are classics for a reason. And green pills are meant to be taken orally once every 24 hours.

"Craftsman and Wolves is one of the best places to get a pastry in the Mission!I come here about once a month, usually after a Pilates class nearby, and it's the perfect pick-me-up. All of the pastries that they offer here and creative and delicious, and you really can't go wrong. I've had their sea salt chocolate chip cookie, croissant, travel cakes, and other pastries, and would honestly recommend all of them! One pastry ranges from $3-$5 while the cakes can get expensive at $8 a slice. They also have loaves of Japanese milk bread here for purchase. There's seating inside for maybe 20-30 and also a bathroom that doesn't require a code or purchase, which is neat. However, this is also why I've noticed a huge line for the bathroom any time I've come in.",5.0 star rating
"Came here for an afternoon delight... Not that kind of delight. Tried one of their pastries and a refreshing peach ice tea, both of which were awesome. Returned again on another day and tried their passion fruit, vanilla, praline dessert and it was so dang good. Not overly sweet or tart and the praline crust was oh so dang good. You can't go wrong at craftsman and wolves. This place is my favorite pastry shop in the city hands down.",5.0 star rating
They have half-off some pastries 4-5pm every day! My friend & I came on a Sunday during around 4pm and tried both Travel Cakes: Gluten-free Chocolate nib and the banana with a drizzle of coconut for $4 total (pretty good). Both were pretty good but I wouldn't pay full price for them - they were tiny!!!. I think I liked the chocolate one slightly more though. My friend kept pointing out that the banana cake didn't have those black squiggly worm lines things in the bread... o___o take that as you will.They have a thoughtful selection of unique pastries so I'd like to try the others some time.I,4.0 star rating
"Craftsman and Wolves is a great spot to drop by for breakfast. I enjoy doing work in the mornings here. The hipster bakery's signature item is called ""The Rebel Within"" -- a savory muffin made from asiago, sausage, green onion, and a soft boiled egg. Couple that with a cup of delicious coffee and free Wi-Fi, and your productivity will definitely skyrocket. I have yet to try any of the sweets on their counter, but everything looks fantastic!ProTip: 10% off if you check in on Yelp",4.0 star rating
"Egg in muffin?? Revolutionary. Cut the Rebel in half and revel in the ooey gooey egg perfection. It came piping hot and fresh and ok I was truly excited for this moment more than the average person would be but it was nothing short of great. The muffin was delicious, cheesy and savory, but had the perfect texture to contain the egg and soak the yolk up as well. My only downside was that it was too filling and I had to stop myself. Latte was delicious and the perfect company to breakfast. Their pastry case was full of yummy interesting goods that I will have to try one day if I could ever turn down the Rebel. But that's for another day. Ambiance is nice, but it kinda smells like hipster wood like some lumberjack cologne, but I guess that's part of the vibe of ~craftsman and wolves~.",5.0 star rating
"Such a good place to get an array of pastries. I went here on a Saturday morning, and it was very busy. I know why though, it's because their pastries are so delicious.The ambience is super cute. A great place to have a first aid, to catch up with friends, to have a small casual brunch, or to just sit down have a great cuppa coffee and have some alone time. The decor is super cute and super modern. Which means clean aesthetics.I opted for the latte with almond milk, and let's just say the coffee here is super strong. Which means that it's a really good bang for your buck when you're looking for a good cuppa coffee that's worth the money.",4.0 star rating
"This was stop #2 on a self-directed coffee/walking tour of SF and I had a delicious cappuccino here. The space was SO cute - I was taking photos of the decor and space and planning how I could incorporate it into my house as soon as I returned to SEA. The pastries were all super beautiful so I had to get one as well. I should have got something different but I was pulled in by the pretty round cake like things (I don't even know what they're called) that was decorated beautifully. It was good, but not great, and a little hard to eat. The base (crust?) tasted a bit stale and I wasn't even mad when it fell off the bottom of the creamy part. Next time I'll try something else as everything looks super tasty!",4.0 star rating

"Wilderness chic meets pastry geek in this boutique bakery. Craftsman and Wolves is probably my favorite bakery in SF - if only it weren't so darned $$$! Good thing there's a 10% Yelp check-in promo for first-timers. ;) The atmosphere here is city bourgois trying to be a little more down to earth, literally, with gnarled tree branches holding up light cords and wolves staring out from posters for D&D meet-ups (yes, that's a thing here). The main attractions seem to be their Stone ($9) and Satellite pastries ($ugh don't even look), as curious as the name suggests, an aesthetically pleasing dessert of firm outer shell, soft and deliciously flavored filling, nestled on a bed of nuts and granola. The flavors change every so often, but I haven't been disappointed yet!If you have the willpower to look away, be sure to check out their other pastries, all delightful and unique. Their seasonal Alfajores Kougin Amann filled with Dulce de Leche ($5) is crunchy, flaky, and just the right amount of sweet. For those with time and money to whittle away plus a stomach to fill, their all-day breakfast menu seems equally appetizing. Regret not getting something while in store? For better or for worse, you can order pretty much everything on the menu via Caviar. But there's definitely an upcharge. Craftsman and Wolves seems equally loved by Insta-foodies and nerds, and what both these groups share in common, besides living off of craft beer and coffee, is their attraction to places with Wi-Fi. And while it's not always the most work-friendly environment, with limited outlets and periodic bursts of people coming through, the drinks are very affordable, whether it's a shot of espresso or bottle o' beer to lubricate the mind.",4.0 star rating

"Is paying $8 for a muffin encasing a poached egg a bit much? Hell yeah it is. But is it worth it? Fuck yeah it is.I've tried a bunch of stuff on the CAW menu but I always come back to The Rebel Within. Nothing is better than cutting it in half and watching that golden yolk seep out of that moist, rich sausage/scallion muffin. I legit cried when I saw that the location in Pac Heights closed down.

If you're a pastry lover then this is your place to go to. It's very hipster and kind of doesn't fit the area. The space is small but its clean and everything is neatly placed. I got the morning bun and rebel. One was sweet and the other savory. I was expecting a bit more from the more from the morning bun. It was flakey and good but nothing spectacular.The rebel was good and a different kind of muffin. Its savory with a runny egg inside. Definitely a popular item. Service was what you'd expect from a hipster bakery/cafe. I wouldn't make a special trip yet but I have to try the desserts to see if that changes.,4.0 star rating
"The first time I came here I came twice in a row because I had to have it again. ""The Rebel Within"" is incredibly expensive for a pastry, but wow... it's (unfortunately) totally worth it. It comes out warm, it's surprisingly savory and the egg is always cooked perfectly (my preference for eggs is always slightly runny, so I'm always very pleased with the texture of the egg inside). The pickled carrots (that's what I'm assuming they are) actually balance out the pastry incredibly well because it is a tad on the salty side, and it's got sausage in it so it's a bit heavy. I wasn't a huge fan of the coffee here, I thought the mocha was too sweet (or maybe I'm just used to the dandelion mocha at Ritual) but I highly recommend coming here and at least trying their famous muffin with an egg in it if you've never been before. Maybe it's not that hard (or maybe it is) but I'm so impressed with the perfect composure of the egg and perplexed by how they did it that I sit there trying to figure it out (instead of looking it up, which would probably be easy) every single time.",4.0 star rating

Bought the satellite cake for my dad's birthday and they got the lettering done in a day! It was amazing; vietnamese cinnamon, caramel, milk chocolate, and even gold shavings!

"After walking past this popular spot on Valencia Street several times in recent years, I decided to check it out and see what all the fuss was about. To my surprise, while the sleek design and expertly decorated pastries caught my eye, I did not leave feeling very impressed with the quality of the baked goods I tried. Part of my dissatisfaction is that I think other bakeries in the Bay have spoiled me. Stop any local resident with a sweet tooth who lacks an aversion to carbs, and they can probably name at least 3 bakeries that consistently put out excellent croissants or other typical patisserie fare. I think my mistake with Craftsman and Wolves is that I did not try their striking tarts and went for simple items like their donut holes and morning bun (it's also possible that these items lose their freshness later in the day). Both visits left me feeling just all right, and I felt that service was scattered when the line was busy. The Americano I tried was good, though this would not be my go-to place for coffee if I was in the area (especially since Four Barrel is not that far away).",3.0 star rating

"Wow, I just had one of the best coffee shop experiences today at Chestnut Street Coffee Roastery. I love a strong cup of caramel macchiato (mmm Peet's), and I know the traditional macchiato comes in a small cup, is frothy and unsweetened. So when I saw the drink listed on the menu as ""Macchiato"" and not ""Caramel Macchiato,"" I just had to ask ""Is that the traditional or the Starbucks kind?"" The staff helping me at the register smiled and told me that it is the traditional kind ""but if you want the Starbucks kind, we can make you the Starbucks kind."" He literally just made my day. Loved their flexibility! The drink was strong and delicious. The barista was also very nice. I also had their potato, eggs, pork sausage, etc. burrito, which was a good size and so tasty/comforting. If you enjoy a little kick like I do, they have a bottle of Tapatío on the condiments counter.Total: ~$11 I can see how parking may be an issue during the week, I was able to snag a metered spot a block away since it was a Sunday morning.

Chestnut Street Coffee Roastery has been in business and operated by the same owner for I believe 25 years. The owner is the guy behind the counter making your drink and does the coffee roasting.

My mom ordered their house drip and was very very pleased with its profile, and the addition of one of their little pastry treats along with our warm drink on a gusty SF afternoon was a perfect way to relax.",4.0 star rating
"Converted from an Irish breakfast/brunch joint, it cleaned up nicely .   The owner is very friendly and cares a great deal about service and quality.  Churros are great, not overlay sugared and just the right firmness.  With delicious dipping sauces to boot.  For savory, my favorites are the mushroom and chicken empanadas.    With private establishments going in and out of business on a weekly basis in this neighborhood, I hope this ones sticks around.  Damn you SF and your skyrocketing rent hikes.",5.0 star rating
"Stopped by and ordered a salad, a baked sweet beef empanada and a baked spicy chicken empanada.At first, I was getting unreasonably annoyed at the wait time (I was being unreasonable; not them) b/c I've been too spoiled by the general food industry's willingness to cater to overly impatient consumers. It took around 20-25 minutes for my 2 empanadas to come out (salad was pre-packaged), but then I remembered that they actually fold the empanada (with filling made each morning) and bake it fresh for each order.They were wonderfully toasty on the outside and warm with delicious flavor on the inside. Well, the chicken one was alrighttttt imo, but I already expected it b/c I generally am lukewarm towards chicken dishes, so that's kinda on me. 2.5/5 spice level (as they described it) was pretty accurate imo. The sweet beef was DELICIOUS and had juices leaking out after each bite.Will definitely be back when I'm in the area!",4.0 star rating
"I really hate to leave a bad comment for any new business, especially a new flavor that is desperately needed in our parkside neighborhood. When I first heard of Chalos opening, I got super excited. Churros and coffee, how can you go wrong? (and add some empanadas). Well, I guess I am used to the Mexican style churros I grew up eating in LA. The ones that are about a foot long, soft and cost less than 2 bucks. I understand we are in one of the most expensive cities in the world, so I am forgiving on the high price.  What I am not so lenient on is the customer service. I got the feeling from one of the baristas, a very snobbish, hipster vibe. (so not the vibe in the sunset). I ordered a few orders of churros and they forgot to give me the dulce de leche for one of them. No biggie. As I walked up to the counter and let them know, right away the guy behind the counter asked me for my name and checked my receipt to make sure that I actually purchased the dulce de leche sauce. Like really? am I trying to scam you out of ONE DOLLAR? That left a bad taste in my mouth.They need to take note of the laid back vibe in our community and I believe this establishment will be more enjoyable.",3.0 star rating
"When I first heard that an empenada and coffee spot would be opening in the sunset, I was very excited. It seemed like it might fit the laid back and community oriented vibe of this neighborhood, creating a vibrant space for all to enjoy as a meeting place, and infusing new culture into the Taraval corridor.Unfortunately I have yet to have a pleasant experience after giving it a few tries. I figured there would be a few kinks to work out, as is usually the case with a new business. But after my fourth time, I will not be returning. Service is absolutely TERRIBLE. Lines are long, accomadations are cramped and uncomfrotable, and customer service is lacking to say the very least. The owner doesnt seem to know what he is doing AT ALL, both in terms of making coffee or how to treat his customers or staff. As i was attempting to make small talk with one of the baristas, the owner chastised not only him but me as well. Growing pains I can understand. But the lack of discipline is embarassing, and treating staff and customers poorly for trying to be friendly is unacceptable, and does not fit nor is welcomed in this close knit community. I will not be coming back and will tell others to avoid the place.",1.0 star rating
"Wow.Just wow.Get yourself the churro with dulce de leche. Wont go wrong. dense. chewy. not like your carnival, costco or disneyland churro.Empanada wise, I had the sweet meat, provolone, spinach and cheese, and chalos. All delicious in their own right. I am used to small versions of empanadas so to see these large puffy ones was a delight to my eyes.The interior of the space is airy and hipster like. One quickly forgets what was once the copper kettle. I can see myself hanging out here when i need a different venue to get work done.Now the workers: the cashier was extra nice to me. the owner came up to me and asked how were things, and i said great and delicious. he walks away. as i was leaving, i look for the owner who was talking with other new patrons at the large communal table, and when i got to the door, i turned around and i said ""thanks"" out loud at his direction, and he just looked at me and went back to talking. therefore one star off.",4.0 star rating
"Ordered the drip coffee ($3) and churros ($3.95) with dulce de leche dipping sauce ($1.00). You get 3 churros in each order. Churros were really fresh, hot, crispy on the outside. The dipping sauce was okay, I could have done without. The coffee is good but really wish they had non-sugar sweetener. Only offered brown sugar and simple syrup. Nice ambiance, playing oldies, bright & airy. Good for groups, hanging out. Need to come back to try their empanadas which are not available until 10am.",5.0 star rating
"I have passed this place on the train for months and have been patiently waiting for them to open. My first time in today did not disappoint!! I absolutely LOVE the handpainted sign on the front of the building and the decor of the inside of the restaurant. I ordered the sweet churros and three empenadas (Jamon y queso, Pollo picante, and tres quesos). The three cheese empenada was absolutely A M A Z I N G because it included blue cheese inside of it which I wasn't expecting. For anyone who doesn't know me I am obsessed with all cheese especially the stinky ones! Everything felt very reasonably priced and everything we had was so dang tasty! Their menu also included breakfast sandwiches + coffee, beer, wine, and some non alcoholic drinks. I am so freaking excited for this restaurant to be a part of the community!!!!",5.0 star rating
"So happy to see a place like this in this neighborhood! You can get espresso coffees, beer, wine, churros, and empanadas. It's a bright space that seems like a happy place to hang out in.We tried the churros with dulce de leche, empanada picante, and Sightglass brewed coffee. Everything was fresh and tasty! They had their grand opening on March 23 and are still working out kinks in stock (several items were out of stock at 10am). However, I'm sure they will dial-in soon.The owner is wonderful and attentive.",4.0 star rating
"Fresh, delicious Argentine empanadas in the Outer Sunset?! Who would have guessed?!Unfortunately, I gave up meat for Lent so I only tried the spinach and cream empanadas, but they were heaven. As my boyfriend said, their dough is perfection. They also have both dessert and savory churros, sandwiches, a full coffee bar, and Bare Bottle beer. The barista made me a delicious hot chocolate that definitely tasted special.The decor is well-done and homey; farm-style with tables and bright blue walls. It fits perfectly in the Outer Sunset and is definitely family-friendly. The owners are a husband-wife couple; one grew up in the Sunset and the other in Argentina. I definitely recommend a stop here, especially since it's right off the L-Line!",5.0 star rating

"Cute empanada shop! Came here for a quick snack on a Saturday afternoon. My boyfriend and I shared 3 empanadas, ham and cheese, carne, and the spinach and cheese.  They were all super crispy and piping hot. Ham and cheese was super cheesy, all kinds of cheese pulls after each bite which I liked, but there was very little ham inside and I could barely taste it. Carne was tasty, full of beef, and very flavorful from the spices, peppers, and onion. This one was one of my favorites and I look forward to trying the Carne Picante my next trip!Spinach and cheese, was the opposite of the ham and cheese, it was LOADEDDD with spinach with less cheese. Still yummy.Overall everything was pretty good, I felt like it was a tad pricey for the size of each empanada, but if I was in the area looking for a snack I would come back again.",4.0 star rating

"I was super excited about this place. I walked in at 9:47 with the intention of ordering 12 or so empanadas and some churros. I was told they can't take empanada orders till 10am. So I can't order. And was further told they can't just take the order and - even if they don't start making till 10am because the kitchen gets overwhelmed. There was no sorry for the inconvenience or anything,  all she said was ""you'll just have to wait a couple of minutes"" and turned around to continue doing what she was doing. This could have been (barely) excusable if they posted clear signs that you can't order certain items on the menu before a certain time, but there wasn't. The cashier in fact had to reconfirm this 'policy' before saying anything.  They surely went interested in selling me anything this morning, so good luck with business. From the pics on yelp, this seems like this is a place people would like to instagram, provided they can actually order anything in the morning.",1.0 star rating
"Finally there is a place in the bay area that sells authentic churros just like how it suppose to taste like the ones in Madrid, reminescense of  Chocolatería San Ginés. If you've already tried the standard churros in SF, this porras are a thicker, more doughy version and well worth a try. This delectable treat may not seem like it would be that addictive, but it really is - once you start dipping, you may eat several churros sticks without even realizing it.As well, this place also sells authentic Argentinian empanadas. The empanadas here reminds of the ones I ate at El Sanjuanino in Bueno Aires. You get the option of either fried or baked, I love both. There were all sorts of empanadas on the menu, such as carne, carne picante, pollo and various vegetarians ones such as provolone, espinaca, choclo, and champignones.I have traveled to numerous places around the world and ate at many outstanding restaurants and I can say this place is legit. So if you want the best authentic Churros and Empanadas, you can either go to Chocolatería San Ginés in Madrid and El Sanjuanino in Bueno Aires or save a plane ticket and go to the sunset to eat at Chalos.",5.0 star rating
"On Chalo's first day:I drove my S.O.'s parents to the airport that morning.And then my aunt and I caught up on some things we had to discuss.Then.. ended up here with her and two of my cousins. It is gentrified, but the empanadas are actually really good. We got empanadas. I got the #3: Carne Picante. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.^The filling was great. The shell was super crispy and good. I tried getting a chai latte: didn't have it. Tried getting the Spanish Hot Chocolate: didn't have it. I got the hot chocolate: they had it and it was alright.. not worth it. I mean for the price it's whatever.. But, Nestle at home for the win.My aunt got churros: I liked their chocolate sauce for it (I think it's a mix of caramel and chocolate.. or it's definitely not just straight up chocolate).",5.0 star rating

"This place is incredible! It's a dessert-only restaurant occupying the original Ike's Place location that has an incredible variety of really cool desserts.Make a reservation when available, otherwise be ready to stand in line for 30-40 minutes. These guys are making much better use of the space than Ike's. Tables in every crevice of the place and all of them are packed.We started with the Young Coconut Pandan Crepe cake. This was a series of coconut flavored crepes piled on top of each other which you can then drizzle with a sweet coconut sauce. It had a really delicate flavor and just melted in your mouth. In a place like this, this was probably the most conventional dessert you could order.Next up was the Thai Tea Lava Toast. This was sort-of like a bread bowl dessert soup. A Brioche bowl filled with this yummy Thai Tea sauce and lots of brioche chunks and then topped with Thai Tea flavored ice cream, whipped cream, and nuts. This was the best dessert of the night. Absolute must have. Kinda like a pre-soaked dessert fondue. So good!!The final dish was the Igloos Kakigōri. This was a giant pile of shaved ice with a marshmallow-ey exterior and served with a kiwi sauce and some sort of condensed milk that you are supposed to occasionally re-drench the igloo with. To start it off, they set it on fire with some kind of alcohol which makes it a really fun dessert to order. As you keep digging inside the snow, you discover it is actually filled with some sort of lychee balls that sort-of explode in your mouth. This is a lot of fun to eat.Need to come back here and try everything else on their menu.",5.0 star rating

"- Coconut pandan crepe cake: without the sauce it comes with, you don't really taste much & just be chewing on the coconut. With the sauce, this is just a coconut crepe cake. Not much pandas flavor- Thai tea float: a little thick consistently, not too sweet, really good.- Mango bingsoo:Love the seed and caramelized coconut on top, gives a nice crunch. The shave ice underneath has a subtle sweet coconut taste which is good because most places is just straight ice or milk. Very refreshing.   - Great place to take photos because the natural lighting & decorations. Even the desserts are insta-worthy",5.0 star rating
"A rare breed indeed.  A full service restaurant (not merely a bakery or sweet shop) that focuses on desserts.  And a nice departure from the European-centric patisseries around town as the menu here is very Asian influenced.  Everything I had was delicious with a few items ranking in the most memorable desserts ever.Igloos Kakigori: This was so much entertainment to watch.  The outer meringue is browned a bit already, but they finish it off by pouring a flaming liquid on top.  Tastes a bit like s'mores when it's all done.  Really loved the fresh kiwi syrup poured over the shaved ice and eaten alongside the meringue, it was like like a frozen kiwi version of a key lime pie.  The condensed milk poured on top worked nicely too.  At the bottom was the nice surprise of little balls filled with what seemed to be lychee.  This dessert looked massive, but it wasn't overfilling thanks to all the ice.Matcha Crepe Cake: I'm not stranger the multi-layer crepe cake.  I've had it at many venues with many different fillings.  The matcha here was intense.  Like not just some sweet cream with a tiny bit of matcha.  It was almost like matcha paste, there was so much powder going on.  On one hand it was a nice contrast to the other desserts which are really sweet.  But some folks at our table thought it was too bitter.Thai Tea Lava Toast: This surprised me.  It looked like another incarnation of Japanese-style Honey Bread.  And in a way it was, since the box was nicely toasted and full of buttery goodness. The bread cubes inside rode that fine line of being somewhat crispy, but also fluffy inside.  But the surprise came with the massive amount of Thai Tea flavored ""lava"".  After getting our photos, we cracked it open and that delicious sauce covered most of the massive plate.  The bread bits helped soak up a bunch and it was also nice dipping in some fruit, almost like fondue.  Definitely took this style of dessert to the next level!",5.0 star rating
"Great spot for a dessert date. Their desserts are definitely Instagram worthy. This place is small. You can make reservations on yelp in advance, if you like.I came here with my boyfriend on a Sunday afternoon. Thankfully, this place wasn't packed, we got sat down immediately. Downside, the tables or floor had a strong bleach smell which made me lose my appetite, a little. It was tough deciding what to get. So many things we could order but we decided to order their Thai Tea Toast and Matcha Lava cake. The lava cake came first. It was DELICIOUS! You have to order this treat when come here. Highly recommend. The cake and matcha flavor was perfectly paired, the green tea ice cream on the side was cherry on top. Presentation, of course, BEAUTIFUL.The Thai Tea Toast was good, but I thought it was overwhelming. It was topped with whipped cream and a scoop of thai tea ice cream. The bottom was toast cubes with tons of Thai flavor cream. The cream on the bottom was warm, so it melted the ice cream really fast. I had to scoop some of the lava cream out, it was too much.Overall, loved the cute concept. Pricing wise, it's on the higher end. We spent about $30 on just two desserts, no regrets. It was delicious, and no doubt I'll be coming back for more.",4.0 star rating
"What can I say about U: Desert Story but U need to go check them out for their interestingly savory deserts. I wish I could post the video that I took of me cutting open the match chocolate lava cake and how the matcha lava just poured out. It was such a beautiful site. While there I witnessed several other deserts that were ordered by other customers and each one has its own uniqueness and flare, and for some of the deserts it was literally flare with flames. I will definitely visit again and try out some more deserts. I recommend U checking them out if you're in the area looking for a unique desert spot in San Francisco.#travelnurseswithoutboarders",5.0 star rating
"My friends have been talking about U:Dessert Story and how unique and pretty their desserts are for some time now. So, I decided this past weekend to go check it out for myself. I made reservations via the Yelp app and it was quick and easy. We came here on a Saturday late afternoon and there was just a slight wait. The place was fully packed and i wasn't surprised at the least.I shared the Young Coconut Pandan Crepe Cake and their Mango Sticky Rice Bingsoo. First of all, I want to say the Mango Sticky Rice Bingsoo was so so good. The Bingsoo is finely shaved ice and you can add as much condensed milk to sweeten it to your liking. I highly recommend this to share and I would come back just for this item. However, the Pandan Crepe Cake was very blah and I actually did not like this item at all. I definitely would not order this again or recommend you do either.Our waiter was quick and all of the staff were moving quickly while we were there. The interior is simple but cool to look at. There is a selfie wall with their branding on the wall where you would wait for a seat, which is along the right wall when you walk in. Their desserts are all over instagram as they photograph very well. I'm sure I'll be back soon to try more of their sweet menu.",4.0 star rating
"Loved the matcha chocolate lava cake-- rich, sweet, dense and creamy. May have not been worth ~$13 (more expensive than my lunch that day) but I have no regrets!The cheese tea is pretty good and there is a lot of cheese if that's your vibe.Didn't really enjoy the thai tea crepe cake as much. Texture slightly rubbery but then again I've never had a crepe cake before so maybe that is how it is supposed to be? The flavor and sweetness mainly came from the custardy bit which allowed me to control the sweetness. Wish they had more of that though!As for wait time, it was pretty reasonable. There was no line when I went and I also didn't make a reservation. We got seated at the ""bar"" immediately.",4.0 star rating
"4.5 stars. Finally an Asian inspired unique dessert place in the neighborhood with loungy relaxing vibes. This one is a Japanese Thai dessert place sitting right in the middle of Castro.  We passed by and decided to give it a go before dinner because it smelled amazing when we walked in to check it out. We got the matcha crepe cake which was delicious. Not too sweet - just how I liked it.  A bit of bitterness from the goodness of matcha. Fantastic combination of matcha, red bean, and soft layered cake. The only suggestion that I had was to make the mille feuille pastry component more flaky and structured so you could actually taste the 20 layers when you are biting into it. We also saw the next table getting the volcanic Thai  shaved ice and it looked good. The next table devoured it pretty quickly which is always a great sign.",4.0 star rating
Love this place! My friend and I went here for dessert after grabbing a bite at Super Duper. Luckily we were able to grab a reservation so we didnt have to wait that long. But they still made us wait for about 15 minutes. This place gets super packed so I highly recommend getting reservations. I got the matcha lava cake and the iced matcha latte and my friend got the Thai Tea crepe cake. Everything was so yummy and had the cutest presentation. My fave has got to be the Thai tea crepe! It was so light and spongey almost. The thai tea flavor wasnt too overpowering either and it wasnt too sweet. Cant wait to come back and try more things!,5.0 star rating

"Dessert Story is soooo good. I came here actually during their soft opening months ago and didn't know it would blow up this big! Then again, it's in prime real estate and the desserts are cute af! I cannot stress enough how reservations are highly recommended. I came here a few days ago without one and it was quite terrible. There's two lines, a second line to acknowledge that they know you're waiting. Then you get to the first line and now they can see you waiting...What I hate is when there is a long line at a restaurant and groups who are done eating are just sitting there talking...we were in line for at least 1.5 hours and when we left, this group of ladies was still there...talking....? Anywho, desserts are super yummy. I've had the thai tea millecrepe and the mango sticky rice bingsoo. Both of which are amazingly delicious. Not to mention, everything here is instagrammable ;) No parking in this area, usually takes 20 min to circle around or longer.",4.0 star rating
"Delicious but totally and ridiculously overpriced!  For that, I'd have to deduct a star.  Also, some of the tables were placed way too close to one another creating some discomfort for the customers.  For that reason, I'd have to deduct half a star.The service was excellent.  The waiters were all super professional and very friendly.For the food, my bf and I ordered Mango Sticky Rice Bingsoo and Thai Tea Crepe Cake.  I'd have to deduct half a star for the crepe cake, please read the details below.The Mango Sticky Rice Bingsoo was absolutely heavenly.  The shaved ice was milky and smooth.  The sticky rice was chewy, sweet, and topped with crunchy toasted coconut (I think).The Thai Tea Crepe Cake was just meh.  One good thing was the whole dessert wasn't too sweet.  But the crepe itself was too dry.  There were some parts of the cake where the crepe wasn't covered by any cream, so I got to try and taste the crepe just by itself.  And it unfortunately wasn't good.  And it cost you $12.  I wouldn't order it ever again.  Sorry.",3.0 star rating

"Everything comes out with such a pretty presentation. definitely perfect for the gram. Everything you order comes out super fast. Ordered:*Pandan crepe cake- looked great. tasted okay.*Thai tea crepe cake- i thought it looked way better than it tasted. i am not quite sure what i was expecting flavor wise. but texture wise it definitely was soft. but wasn't my favorite crepe cake. *Mango and sticky rice bingoo - i liked it! it comes w/coconut flakes, coconut milk, condense milk, sticky rice, & the shaved ice and mango. you will pretty much put it together yourself. *Blue lychee (drink)- it has two lychee and lychee flavored popping boba. loved the color of the drink. pretty good as a drink.so they move quick here. they seat you fast, they take your order quickly, and they give you the check fairly fast. even though they say take your time, its really get the heck out someone is waiting for your table. and its true, the line is out of the door, its pretty packed. thank goodness for reservations on yelp. and even then my party of 6 had to wait about 15 mins. they had a ton of things i wanted to try but i didn't want to go too crazy. now that i tried it and got it out of my system, i wouldn't come back. there's so many other places in SF i want to try. if you haven't been to U dessert, i say give it a try. but not worth an hour wait if you ask me.

"You can make reservations on yelp! Made reservations for Sunday at 1:45pm, but didn't really need it since there was no wait. Probably better for night, as I can see this place getting really busy. So I follow them on IG and found out they just released a new flavor of bingsoo... durian! Omg was it everything and more than I hoped for! They only offered it in their small size, which was for perfect for my friend and as we got the small mango as well. Durian bingsoo ( actually soft durian pieces not the frozen kind and durian sticky rice on the side, served hot!) Mango bingsoo ( mango was Tart, but perfect combo since the durian was sweet, also comes with sticky rice) Can't wait to come back and try more!",5.0 star rating
"Snow cream is my kryptonite and Dessert Story delivers and excels. First thing first- the menu just has too many delicious options. We spent 5 minutes debating what we wanted because everything looked great. Ultimately, we were able to decide on the coconut crepe cake and the mango sticky rice bingsoo- both were delicious. I really have difficulty deciding which was my favorite.Only issues I have with Dessert Story is that the space is small and the wait can be brutal- we lucked out and only had to wait 10 minutes on a Wednesday night.Then again, Na Ya, the other dessert house with similar quality items also suffers from a brutal wait so there's really no winning. Luckily, you can make reservations here so that's probably the best call. The other issue I have is the drinks are so pricey!!! I wish they were cheaper, but whatever.Still my favorite dessert spot in the Castro.",5.0 star rating
"Husband: ""But you just had dessert.....You want to go to another place for even more dessert?""Me: 8} Even if you JUST HAD dessert, this place is absolutely worth a second pit stop. So far, I adore the tempting Korean-Japanese-Thai style dessert and beverage selections from here. Come in a group so you can try a bunch of different items! During my visit, I ordered the Pandan Crepe Cake with house made young coconut sauce on the side. By the way, this jizz sauce makes the cake; use all of it. I love how this cake and the accompanying sauce weren't cloyingly sweet. I also ordered an iced Matcha Latte, which was perfect! The organic matcha comes from Japan's Encha Uji Farm, so its gotta be legit. TL;DR: High-quality desserts that I strongly recommend. + Order whole crepe cakes at least 1 day in advance + Reservations recommended on weekends",5.0 star rating
"Bomb.com!This place is awesome. The selection of yummy desserts is great. The service was also amazing. We had a large group come in and we ordered the pandan fondue type thing with soft sweet bread to dip in and the Korean Mango Bingsoo. Both were equally delicious! The pandan had a balanced flavor, not to sweet and not too soupy: the bread was abundant and very soft. It was delicious! The Mango Bingsoo was incredible! There were large pieces of tart mango and a nice amount of condensed milk. They also included more condensed milk on the side which was super nice. The combination of the two desserts was epic and I would come here again and again for them! The girls working the day we came we're sweet and super helpful. They seated us right away and answered our questions. I definitely recommend trying this place for yourself as it's good for small and large parties.

"One of my favorite places to get work done, have good food and enjoy a drink on a weekday by FiDi. This place gets waves of customers during the say; it's a popular healthy (aussie-style) lunch spot, so from 1 to 2 pm on a weekday you can see lines of working professional forming to get some food and drinks. It can get a bit loud, too, so it's a great spot for focusing and doing work but nor great for taking conference calls or any work-related calls. They also have wifi and outlets, so you can camp out here for a few hours if you are in your zone. Pro tip: get a matcha latte with oat milk and the salmon toast. Delicious.",5.0 star rating

"Alright, I finally ended up on Yelp to do a review after my experience today.  I typically visit this location every Saturday after my appointments downtown.  Usually, they are good with service, attention to detail, etc.  Today, was just completely off.   I ordered avocado toast with 2 poached eggs, to eat in.  I bussed the table my friend and I sat at (if you go in, please bus your own table.  There's a spot to do so and it's not that hard).  We sat and talked and then my order comes out:  in a to go container, with my second poached egg in a cup of some sort.  Not entirely sure why the second egg wasn't on the actual toast, or why I got a to go container (specified we were eating there, coffee came in a glass).   So, already wasting non-reusable items when it could've been on a plate, plus it's easier to eat that way. Now, here's the part that made me write this.  I cut into the eggs and into the toast,  I have two hard boiled eggs.  Nope, not poached.  Instead of complaining I ate it, whatever- an egg is an egg.It's the overall experience.  Lack of attention to detail and not making sure the cafe is clean and picked up for other guests to enjoy.  I'll give it another try, as I know everyone has an off day.  If this is the new norm though, I'll take my business elsewhere.",3.0 star rating
"I docked a point out for cleanliness. While waiting in line to order, my coworkers and I were in the front and saw the sample food area with all the pastries filled with MANY MANY fruit flies. There was a sign that says it was used only for display, but it seemed like the food was there for days and felt pretty gross. Hopefully they switch up the food more often because it made me hesitant about how sanitary this place really is.First impression is that this place is boujee, but I like how modern and bright the atmosphere is. It feels very open and friendly.I got the Salmon Toast ($9) and the Matcha Latte ($5.5). I enjoyed the toast a lot. It came in this fancy looking blue box and made the experience feel special. I like the smoked salmon and the cream cheese was super delicious. They gave a lot of cream cheese too which was nice.The latte wasn't really my thing because it wasn't sweet enough. But my coworker liked the matcha sweetness and says that's how taste is like in Japan. Moreover, the toast was OK pricing, but the latte was pretty expensive for that small cup. I'd recommend passing on the drink.",3.0 star rating
"Solid avocado toast and affogato, but truth be told I've had better.In terms of toast I still prefer Mazarine - to DIE for.And affogatos - I didn't think I'd ever be crazy about any affogato because it's literally ice cream with espresso but I absolutely loved the one at Kona Coffee Purveyors (Hawaii).Cute cafe, and a nice option in the FiDi area for coffee!",4.0 star rating
"Aussie homesickness cured? Tick. Having seen the other (lesser?) branch I was intrigued to see if the original venue could do better. Coffee was flawless. No problem. Vegemite toast? The server asked if I wanted butter - heresy to any Australian. Vegemite *must* be consumed on buttery toast. After that hiccup... remarkably good. Perfectly toasted sourdough, thick without being tough or chewy. They know their stuff here - despite the butter aberration.",5.0 star rating
"Decided to treat my Aussie boyfriend to an Aussie coffee and snack. He ordered an iced latte (American iced- not AU iced) and avo toast. I ordered an Australian iced chocolate and banana toast. His coffee and toast were excellent, while my drink was good but toast was subpar. I was disappointed with the ambiance; there was just too much happening design wise, so it wasn't relaxing. The other thing that was disappointing was the messy tables with crumbs all over.",3.0 star rating
"If I had to review this place based on the people I'd give it 5 stars. The people were very accommodating and patient while I asked questions on just about every foreign menu item. They also were quick to clean unused or finished plates. There was a long line at first, but once the line started moving, everything went really quickly. The service was great!Unfortunately, I cannot say the same things about all the food. It was extremely overpriced and some of the pricing modules didn't even make sense. I got 1/2 of an avocado toast and a small yogurt with granola for $16 dollars, when a full avocado toast is $8. If a full avocado toast is $8, then 1/2 of an avocado toast should be $4, right? Then the rest of the meal.. a small yogurt and granola costs $12? It just didn't make complete sense, but I was hungry so didn't really care. Th avocado toast was ok. I actually didn't even finished it because it wasn't anything exceptional. The yogurt and granola was really, really good though! Maybe not $12 good, but good enough to finish the whole thing and feel satisfied (although I'll need another snack in an hr or two). I also got an iced coffee. It was good. I'd come back here, but not for the toasts. There are definitely other things on the menu I'd like to explore (like the aussy latte!",3.0 star rating
"I was about to write a 1 Star review after the fiasco of this place last time when I was in Washington DC, where I didn't get a simple toast until 25 minutes later after I finished my coffee and the latte art got ruined by overpowering amounts of chocolate powder. I decided to give this place another try with the free coffee ticket they gave me for the inconvenience. I decided to check out their Aussie iced latte since after some research, this is an Australian inspired coffee shop. I got it with oat milk, and overall, I really liked it. Same goes for the salmon toast, where all the ingredients are fresh and they put it into a very nice takeout box, similar to when you pull something out of a drawer. It's pretty cute I guess.This time I am far from disappointed. I really enjoyed the food and drink as well as the customer service. I would go back again sometime, when I decide to splurge a little, because this is a very pricey place that would have set me back $19+ if it weren't for the promo and free coffee. Thanks for giving yourself a second chance; you earned back a customer :)",5.0 star rating
"Great spot to catch up with friends over coffee and brunch in San Francisco Financial district. Love their ambience. The interior is so tiny, bright, modern, and Instagram worthy. Also, the coffee and toasts are amazing!!Ordered for 3 ppl:Drinks：Latte: (4.5/5):  good quality coffee beans.Golden Latte (?/5): Not a big fan of cinnamon, and no dare to try a sip. ://Food:Avocado Toast (5/5): The best in the town!!! Love their avocado Toast recipe, fresh smash avocado seasoned w/ lemon juice, salt&pepper , chili flakes &olive oil!! The roast of toast just prefect. Tips: I would like to add some extra on the top next time, such as prosciutto or poached egg. Salmon Toast (4/5): according to my friends' comments. It tastes good but too creamy. Breakfast Bowl (4/5): kale, avocado, cherry tomato, red quinoa & poached egg. Hmmmm.. I can feel the healthiness from the breakfast bowl. Maybe few drop of lemon juice would make the salad bowl taste even better. Croissant (5/5): yummy! Crispy and buttery. Very match with the latte.",5.0 star rating
"I went here twice over the weekend. 1. The coffee is great. If you're a blue bottle fan (I am), this is equally good. 2. I also tried the matcha latte on the second day that I went here, it was good. 3. My favourite here was the avocado toast. Nothing complex, simple bread with generous spread of fresh avocados served with salt and paprika drizzle on top. My only minor complaint is that they charge you $1 extra for making your drink extra hot. I find that a bit strange. Else the place is a definitely worth a stop to grab a small bite or get a coffee.",4.0 star rating
"I've tried this place a few times for breakfast and I consider it one of my go-to breakfast places when I want to treat myself. Cute little venue, great quality (and fairly healthy) food, nice and attentive staff, slightly pricey menu. I've tried the signature avo toast (with and without poached egg), Australian iced coffee, salmon toast, raspberry almond croissant, chocolate chip cookie, and the lemon blueberry muffin. The toasts are the best thing you could order. Steep price at $9, but it's honestly the best toasts hands down. The bread they use is fantastic in texture with a great balance of chewy, fluffiness and a nutty, toasty exterior. The slice is actually pretty large in size, cut thick, and placed in a cute little box. Both the avo toast and the salmon toast are tasty, but between the two, I prefer the avo toast. Both are pretty generous in toppings and are great quality, but I enjoy the flavors more in the avo toast personally (creamy, citrusy, spicy). The egg is great, a worth-while addition. As for the pastries, I enjoyed them all. The raspberry almond croissant was the most beautiful and my favorite of the three although it was a little too sweet. The lemon blueberry muffin is my next favorite for the simplicity in flavors and sugary, crusty top. The cookie was meant to be eaten with coffee, not on its own which made it less appealing for me since I don't always get coffee. I ordered the Australian iced coffee just because I was curious to know what it was and didn't bother to ask. It's vanilla ice cream in a cup of iced coffee! Actually really great, but not something I would order in the morning often. Overall, a great little cafe worth trying. I'll be back, especially for the avo toast.",4.0 star rating
"I've been to one of these in NY so I was excited to try the one here. I went for brunch/lunch with my friend on a Saturday at 12pm. It was starting to empty out, so we were able to get seats. Tables are pretty close together, so seating is a bit tight. I ordered the Market bowl (~$14), which was the same as the Breakfast Bowl (~$14, which my friend got) except had beets, corn, and cucumber. It's a little pricy and something I could make at home, but I do like the combination and it was plated very nicely. My only thing is that while pretty, the avocado did not seem ripe enough yet, and did not taste ripe either. A bit expensive for what it is, but I would come here again for a healthy brunch.",4.0 star rating
"Came here per the suggestion of a friend and ordered an Americano for about $5 before tip, which is expensive. It was a decent Americano though. My friend had the avocado toast and an iced coffee for almost as expensive. I guess you're paying for the location. The avocado toast was yummy and served on good bread, which is a plus, but is it worth the price? Meh. The atmosphere is nice, though, and has such great colors for being right next to an alley of homeless people. I don't know if I'll ever choose to come back, but it could be a nice place to have coffee with friends that isn't Starbucks.",3.0 star rating
"The first Bluestone Lane I ever tried was in the Financial District in New York and now I'm so happy to see Bluestone Lanes popping up all over the place - even here, in SF! I dropped by on a Friday morning for some avo toast and a golden milk latte. I hadn't had one of these since New York and I was really craving a delicious turmeric drink! Overall, I was pleased by the service (which is amazing!) and the ambiance of the store. It looks lively but also not too much so, as people are able to get their work done in here. The price point is again, quite steep but it's to be expected here in San Francisco. I'd love to return and try some of their coffee here next time!",4.0 star rating
"I love impressing my friends with Yelp discoveries. I'm now the default person for picking places for food and drink, including a 7:00 AM breakfast that my friends and I met up for. Bluestone seemed adorable, and who in San Francisco doesn't love overpriced toast?Pretty sure Bluestone is Australian, judging from the wait staff accents and the vegemite on the menu. Everyone is super sweet, and I love the cute and classy atmosphere. My friend saved seats for the rest of us to arrive. I'd recommend groups of 2 to 4 people max since it's a tight fit. It was surprisingly busy for a weekday morning.We all ordered hot coffee, which came in a glass carafe aside a colorful ceramic mug. For breakfast I got the avocado toast, which was delicious and filling. Whenever we needed something, it seemed like I had to make an effort to flag someone down, but the actual process of ordering and paying was seamless.While I wouldn't rush to come here again, I truly enjoyed my experience and would recommend it to anyone looking for a new spot to check out in the Financial District. It's a few blocks away from Embarcadero Center, and it's open super early! Definitely lots of notable wins.",4.0 star rating
"Nice place for a coffee! I went in with the purpose of getting a latte but decided to go for the mocha instead. The mocha was good, enough chocolate and coffee taste. Glad that it wasn't too sweet ! The one caveat is that the place isn't large and doesn't have much seating. Every time I've come the place is quite full and here's always a line. Usually it doesn't take too long but other times it does. Either way, I've always had a good experience coming in and I'd recommend the mocha and the latte. I love that they serve milo, didn't know it was popular in Australia as it is in South America. Will be back!",4.0 star rating
"Fantastic coffee! I met up a buddy of my for coffee and he suggested this place. The cold brew is strong and smooth, as they all should be. Iced and black is how I prefer my coffee. It's slightly pricy for coffee, but I love how places like this thrive in the big city. It was a Tuesday morning, and packed with people taking a break from their busy workday. The place was packed, and the only option was to take our coffee to go. I can't complain though, as it was such a nice day to be walking around the city.I paid with a credit card, and intended to tip with cash but realized that they don't have a tip jar.....Umm y'all should get one.",4.0 star rating

"I came in by invite from Sarah, the wonderful manager who is responding to my feedback from a previous experience at Bluestone Lane. She more than compensated for the mishap the first time, and she was incredibly polite in explaining to me the situation while also taking ownership and addressing my concerns. Regarding the food and drinks, I probably had one of the best slices of avocado toast in my life. The thick yet soft and chewy multigrain toasted bread Supported a bed of smashed avocado along with a perfectly poached egg. The entire creation was drizzled with olive oil and topped with chili flakes. I recommend you eat the toast as soon as possible as the bread will still be warm as well as the egg on top. At this location specifically, you can either dine in with table service, or you can order from the counter. The Bright interior Decour filled with wooden tables plants and glass bottles just feels comforting and clean, and creates a pleasant daytime dining experience. The tables are a little squeezed together, but it does not detract from the meal, as it feels more intimate and cozy than crowdedThey have Wifi as well, and I look forward to coming back.",5.0 star rating

"The first time I stopped at their bakery location, when it first opened, it must have been an off day because I couldn't find any vegan options. This was surprising because their regular locations always had muffins, cookies, etc.However, having gone more recently, I was delighted to find a few different cookie options and muffin. My partner got the chocolate chip cookie and I got the blueberry banana muffin. And that muffin was seriously one of the best vegan ones I've had in a while. All too often vegan muffins can be on the dry side. But the fruit in this muffin was plentiful and gave it the perfect consistency.Now that I know to look here for vegan pastries, I'll also need to try some of their breads. The loaves, etc. behind the counter look excellent!",4.0 star rating

One of my favorite bakeries in SF. If you don't come early enough they run out of everything and by early it's slim pickings at 11am.I got the black sesame kiwi coffee cake and it was so heavenly. It had the perfect amount of light sweetness and moisture lasting until the following day.  I hate when coffee cakes are dry and you really need to pair it with coffee. The coffee cakes here seem to change with the season but they were both good both times I had it. The Vietnamese coffee twist bun was sweet and really tasted like a vietnamese coffee. The only issue I had with this was there were pieces of coffee beans in this pastry and I wasn't expecting it so it really caught me off guard. I could really do without that because you have soft delicious bread with beans inside of it. It's like having seeds in an orange. I can't seem to get that lattice cardamom lattice bun so don't hit the snooze button on that alarm. They have a parking lot but it's always full and even parking in the surrounding area is a little difficult. Totally worth the trek though. In case some of you were wondering Jane the bakery is different from Jane on Fillmore. Jane on Fillmore serves more food and is more of a sit down spot. The bakery has some seating but more of a grab and go type of spot.,5.0 star rating
"There are about 3-4 Jane The Bakery locations in SF. It's an interesting bakery business and I think it's worth it. I was going to spend some time on this Saturday at Bob Mizer, but that was canceled. So I decided to have a lunchtime adventure at Jane The Bakery on Geary Blvd. I drove a car because they have a small parking lot, but I got lost finding this on Geary. Anyhow, when I arrived, I noticed a long, unbearable line, but I decided to stick with the line. I didn't know what I wanted and it was hard to decide. I decided on a cheesy flatbread and a fresh baguette($4). I decided on an espresso shot($3). I had the flatbread at the shop and also drank my espresso, which was a bit sour to taste. It was served in a nice black ceramic espresso shot cup. I really don't like when they serve espresso in cardboard cups. Espresso should always be served in a ceramic shot cup, and maybe with a saucer. PERFECTO! I have the baguette at home and offered it to my father. Then I drove home.",4.0 star rating
"Meh, was not impressed so probably wouldn't return since there are so many other bakeries in the area. We ordered an avocado mash toast & mushroom toast. Neither really stood out to me. The avocado toast seemed like something you can make at home yourself and I wasn't a fan of the pickled jalapenos - made it kinda cheap like hotdog condiments. The mushroom toast wasn't bad, but it was soooo tiny. I was still starving afterwards. Total was $17. I also ordered a matcha latte, which they completely forgot about. When I checked up on it, they apologized and asked for my card again because they forgot to charge me for it and forgot to make it. It tasted very grainy and powdery! Maybe they were rushing when they made it for me? Another $5. After $21 spent here, we were still hungry & dissatisfied so we went to B Patisserie afterwards :).",3.0 star rating
Delightful! I really love this place. The cheddar chive biscuit is delicious. Crusty exterior and light and fluffy center. The chocolate croissant is very good as well. The twice baked almond croissant is also very tasty and crispy. Get there early because usually there's a line and most defiantly they sell out of popular items. I also tried a mocha super tasty but it definitely woke me up (I am not a big coffee drinker).,5.0 star rating
"Huge bread lover here, with an extra love for croissants. And wow the pastries were very impressive. They nailed the classic croissant very well and had a lot of original interesting creations. Chocolate croissant --was our favorite! Chewy, flaky, with a fragile crust. The chocolate was good quality too. It was also huge but we engulfed it. Lattice bun --This was quite new and interesting! It's like a croissant brioche bun-- crioche bun? Yeah not as catchy as a cruffin but love the novelty of it. It was really puffed up and inflated, I mean the cross-section was quite impressive. The cardamom custard cream was bomb. It's like a vanilla custard with a mild cinnamon-y spice. Latte with oat milk was delicious too. Cute cup! :) The con was that-- there's barely seating and there's that one long tiny table facing the window,  but your back will be very close to the line of people. Yet the pastries were so good we had an intimate bread time in our own little yeast bubble.",4.0 star rating
"Begun first as a Coffee shop on Fillmore, Amanda Michael's years of working in the kitchen for others spurring a desire to create something of her own, it is through steady growth that Jane has subsequently expanded to Larkin and Geary Boulevard, the latter titled ""Jane The Bakery"" opened in late 2016 and by far the largest outpost. Built on ideas of hospitality, quality and balance, the menu slowly evolving to now include Pastries, Breakfast and Lunch served from 7:00am daily, it is immediately on entry that guests will notice an array of items unmatched by any other artisan bakeshop in The Bay Area, overhead menus adding to what can be found on racks or in cases with fresh items continuously being baked in back. Mostly locally-sourced and organic when possible, head baker Jorgen Carlsen and Pastry Chef Alexander Terrazas assisting Chef Michael at ""The Bakery"" while other locations each have their own team in place to cut down on transfers, it is well-advised that first-time visitors take time to peruse before placing an order, though a well-trained staff is happy to make recommendations for the indecisive. Truly a scratch kitchen, Chef Carlen's collection of Breads built from old starters and house-blended Flour forming the base for Toast and Sandwiches, it was while awaiting the former slathered in ground Almonds and Raspberry Puree that eight additional items were requested, a total just over $40 including Milk and Coffee not bad considering both the area and quality.Targeting both favorites and variety, the Gluten-free Toast noteworthy for a dense crumb created by no-less than nine Nuts and Grains, it was moving next to four Cookies that a range of textures and flavors were discovered, the ""Cookie For Breakfast"" unfortunately very dry save for bits of Fruit while Cap 'n Crunch, Chocolate Chip Toffee and one dubbed ""Crazy"" all sported crispy rims and soft centers plus the amount of sweetness expected from their ingredients.Onward to Viennoiserie, the Almond Croissant caked with Frangipane thankfully not compromised by too much of the cloying Paste inside, those seeking something laminated would be better off targeting Jane's Kouign Amann that ranks middle of the pack for Northern California, but for those seeking something truly memorable the decision comes down to a buttery Scone made with roasted Chestnuts versus Jane's ""Lattice Bun"" that eats like Yorkshire Pudding filled with Custard heavily perfumed by Cardamom.",3.0 star rating

"One day I was driving by this place on the way to Japantown and saw a long line in front. I had no idea what this place was but saw the name Jane. I went by pretty fast so I am not sure if the line was to go into here or something else nearby LOL Anyway I was intrigued enough by the line to look Jane up on Yelp and found it had really good reviews. The next time I was in the area I dropped by and got a nice parking spot in their lot and waited in a short line inside. I ordered a few different types of croissants, a sourdough loaf and a few other items. The croissants were a definite highlight especially the chocolate one! Buttery and flaky! They are good but I prefer the ones at Ariscault just a bit more. If you like breads, they are really good here too and they are happy to give you samples to try.

"Ordered a sandwich here for the first time and ended up waiting 10-15 mins. While everyone after me got their orders. Front person checked on my order and it was finally ready 5 mins later. However, I ordered it to eat in the bakery and was told they would call my name when it was ready. All I heard was ""sandwich!"" And the guy in the back was looking at me cuz I was the only one left waiting. He had put my order in a huge take out box instead of on a plate. Then I noticed that there were no spinach on the sandwich like it was written on the menu. Had to go tell the the guy in the back that they didn't put any spinach on it. Not a great experience. Definitely not worth $10 as it was also pretty small. I did like the bread and bought a sourdough baguette so I can make my own sandwiches! Nice employees in the front though.",3.0 star rating
"Pretty solid coffee shop near the China Town area. I like this place because we were staying a mile away, and wanted a spot to hunker down for a bit in San Fran. Not too many spaces have seating for a mind numbing laptop experience, but this place looked good according to Yelp and we took the chance. All in all, pretty glad we found it; the ambience was a bit loud, and lively with all the people (a good thing for me). The staff were nice as well; I ordered an espresso and their breakfast sandwich. The espresso was clean and not bitter, and flavorful. The sand which has the best runny yolk that spilled all over my computer and pants (totally validating how spot on their egg sandwiches are and how all egg sandwiches should aspire to be).Go to this place with confidence, and a hungry stomach!",5.0 star rating
"I have been a long-time fan of the Réveille Coffee Co. truck that sets up shop a couple blocks away on Sansome, but this was my first time taking my talents to the brick and mortar. While I can surely understand why some have described the space as feeling cramped, I had no issue finding a spot at one of the counters on a rainy weekday morning.My go-to here is typically the matcha latte, which has such an incredible flavor. This time I went with just a regular ol' latte, though, and found it to be nearly just as delicious as the matcha lattes I am so accustomed to. The physical store also has oat milk, which fans of my reviews by now know I am a gigantic fan of. If you haven't had an oat milk latte, you haven't lived yet.Seating can be a bit cramped, as the building is one tiny little triangle on a crowded corner of Columbus. But the internet is great and there are plenty of outlets if you're staying for awhile. They have a kitchen and food, but I was only interested in beverage, so I don't know what they offer.

That's usually no big deal since a good and strong iced coffee should do the trick.  I had their iced coffee and wasn't too impressed.  I tasted more water, than coffee.  I also didn't get that boost of energy that I was looking forward to.  I was regretting my order just after a few sips and wished I went with their iced Americano.  Overall, my experience was just okay.  The service was at least up to par.",3.0 star rating

I love their espresso and pastries! This place has a cool layout and is a great place to stop by if you're around North Beach.,5.0 star rating
An adorable cafe with a unique layout. Has enough space to study or work while sipping on their yummy mocha! Lots of natural light and even outdoor tables and benches are available if you want to enjoy the sun when the weather gets warmer.,4.0 star rating
"Cool little cafe with a very artsy feel! It's a corner cafe and they used the space well.The mocha and latte we got were both yummy! They have food as well, as there's a kitchen in the back. Great place to stop by to study or for a quick coffee after a meal.",4.0 star rating
"Great corner store coffee shop with plants galore! It's everything you'd imagine a hipster coffee shop to be, avocado toast and all. I came here on a Saturday and while most tables were full, it wasn't packed at full capacity. This place can be a little tricky to navigate once inside because since it's a corner shop at an angle, you find yourself dodging patrons and tables.I ordered the avo toast about $4 plus $2 extra for the poached egg addition and a regular chai ($4). With tip my breakfast came out to about $14. SF is pricey even for a slice of bread with earth on it :)The avo toast was a Pinterest dream with slices of avocado, salt, pepper, and an egg. The chai was light and airy although I preferred my chai a little stronger to be honest. I'll have to return again to try the rest of the expresso offerings to be a solid review but for now my love of plants and people watching way this is a solid coffee shop. I would come hither again!",4.0 star rating
"I definitely agree with the Yelper, Teddy, from below as my experience was oddly similar to his. It is hard to describe the vibes from the baristas, but there was no welcome or sincere concern of quality customer service. I ordered a 12 oz vanilla latte that cost me over $6!! To add vanilIa, you pay $1.25. Pardon me, but was it sent from the gods?! I had to ask her to repeat herself, because I was so shocked. But Ipaid for the drink anyway. I understand how it is to deal with 'that customer'. The vanilla latte was nothing I haven't had before.",2.0 star rating
"Avocado toast and coffee were great. Simple and delicious. Service was not fantastic: the guy knew there was a line but was on his phone anyhow and the girl making coffee had to take over. Also... $1.25 to add vanilla (that I didn't even taste). They charge 3% for employee healthcare too, which is cool if the employees are welcoming and actually good. I asked where to put my dishes and was rudely pointed to where. Honestly, won't be back. There are much better places around SF than here.",3.0 star rating
"Absolutely love the vibe and location here. I was staying just a couple blocks away for the weekend and a friend walked us here for our (very necessary) morning coffee. Over the course of the weekend I had a regular coffee, an americano, and a matcha latte here, each of which I really enjoyed. The shop itself is pretty small but really pretty. Everything from the fresh flowers to the branded cups to the light fixtures made me happy here.  The only issue I had here is that I liked it so much, I came back the next morning on my way to run an errand. I showed up right at 8 am, which is when they open on Sundays, and the two younger baristas inside seemed annoyed that they had to unlock the door for me. They were also blasting John Mayer and none of the chairs were set up yet, so maybe they got in late or something. Anywho, not a huge deal and I'd definitely be back next time I'm in the neighborhood.",4.0 star rating
Had to wait a few hours to check in to my hotel after flying in so came here to sit for a little and have a coffee. The coffee itself was good & it was really pleasant to sit and people watch. I liked that I could get my iced coffee for here in a glass so I sat for a little while which was definitely a plus. I usually don't mind paying around $6 for coffees but my latte was $7 and I've definitely had better. If you're coming here for the atmosphere and vibe I'd recommend it but if I lived here I wouldn't come here specifically for the coffee. Come here earlier- the line was out the door when we left around lunchtime.,4.0 star rating
"Great wifi, great drinks, and awesome service. My biggest gripe is they play their music way too loud that it defeats the purpose of me coming here to do any work.

"I found Reveille to be a bit pricey, even for San Francisco, but you can't argue with the quality - the coffee and tea (and food!) are on point ;). This Reveille is located on a busy intersection in North Beach, so it's such a transformation to walk inside into the warm, cozy (and sometimes quiet, but sometimes loud-ish and busy) environment... Or you can feel free to take your treats outside to hang out in their outdoor seating section, just off the main street and perfect for people watching on sunny days. The staff are friendly and helpful and can give suggestions if you're stuck. Great experience(s) here and already looking forward to my next visit :)",5.0 star rating
"This place was just okay.  Honestly, I think what deterred me from liking this place more was the initial greeting I got from the girl taking orders.  She didn't smile, didn't say hello, didn't ask ""how may I help you?"" and was just staring at me waiting for my response.  I was just looking at her and felt like I should initiate then, which was really awkward. Well I placed my order and waited for my drink.  They were not even busy at the time, so I was curious as to why she was so unresponsive. Well the coffee was good, but I could have gotten the same at any other coffee place.  There wasn't anything special that sets this cup of coffee apart from the other coffee shops nearby.  So my suggestion is that if you want to retain customers, please deliver better customer service and create a welcoming environment to all customers that come in, each and every one at all times.",2.0 star rating

"Ordered a regular cup of java. No specials.  My daughter brought me here because it's her regular coffee hangout.It is located at the corner of Columbus and Kearny.  Prime location since it's surrounded by North Beach, Chinatown, Telegraph Hill, and The Financial District.There is ample indoor and outdoor seating.  Very ....... chic.Coffee was good.  The coffee is strong enough to come through the added cream & honey, but not so strong like an expresso.I give an A-OK 3-Star because I've had different, not better, just different coffee.  Pricing is comparable at $3.25, but I'll take my Starbucks every time.Will I come back. Yes, but I will not go out of my way to return.",3.0 star rating
"Réveille Coffee Co. What an awesome location on a corner and near Little Italy of San Francisco. First off, I highly recommend walking the streets of Little Italy and Chinatown. There are so many restaurants, shops, markets (with loads of fresh fruits and veggies). We took a free (name your own price) walking tour through the area and it was worth it (read my other review about it). Anyways, as I was saying. This coffee shop is located on the corner of a street and you can't miss it. The sun shines in the shop making it warm and bright. The menu is simple and I asked if the chai syrup was vegan and it was so I ordered a dirty chai with non cow milk in it. Making it vegan of course! The baristas were very nice and made the drinks face. My significant other ordered a macchiato and it had beautiful latte art. There's a restroom in the back and complimentary water station too! Back to the dirty chai, it was good, a little too foamy for my liking and I would have preferred a little more of a cinnamon taste to it. But I would come back again. As always, Go vegan (or at least try)",4.0 star rating
"Matcha latte: I liked it how they didn't skimp on the matcha and the latte wasn't overloaded with sugar. However, there was quite a bit of matcha residue at the bottom of the cup. I found the drink to be quite comforting until I had to spit out a green tea stem from my mouth.",3.0 star rating

"Don't waste your time walking up the hill. Despite several positive reviews about vegan options at this place, we walked here and were met with a curt response of ""no."" And ""nothing"" when I asked if they could throw something vegan together. Maybe that's just the normal SF attitude but it was a complete turn off. I didn't even want to spend my money on coffee there. Almond and soy are their only upcharged dairy-free options. What a shame! Looked cute on the inside",1.0 star rating
"A small cute cozy cafe located at a convenient location in Nob Hill. I was so excited to try their cragels but they were out of it! :( Some other time I guess!Ordered a Chai latte and egg salad sandwich to go. Both were pretty good. Crunchy and delicious bread. I ate the hot egg salad sandwich for first time and it was very interesting (Order yours cold if you want, staff is pretty friendly and accommodating). Only reason for taking off 2 stars: After reaching home, I realized that my sandwich was missing its accompaniments ie lettuce, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers :(",3.0 star rating
"I looove Beanstalk! I've been here a few times now and am about to become a regular once I move to Nob Hill next week! Such a bright and sunny cafe with CRAGELS! I instantly become happier every time I walk into Beanstalk.

Add an iced latte to the mix and you've got yourself a scrumptious breakfast situation. Friendly staff, good vibes, and delicious food. Definitely on the pricey side. My sandwich + my drink = $17. But for sure worth every penny.",4.0 star rating
"This cute cafe is conveniently located a few blocks of Union Square. I was staying nearby and there were only a few options available for a quick bite on an early Sunday morning. Beanstalk didn't disappoint. I ordered a simple cragel (croissant/bagel) with cream cheese. The cragel was toasted and the quality cream cheese melted nicely. Service was ok, interior was cute, I'm a fan. I saw other patrons with different items and all looked appetizing.#6/2019",4.0 star rating

"Interior - pretty cute.Coffee - good. Customer service and friendliness - 0/5. I asked for room in my coffee, so the cashier left me a little space. There was only whole milk and half and half available to use, so I asked the barista if I could use the soy milk to top off my coffee. He said no, not if I didn't pay the 35 cents for soy. I showed him how little I would be using (less than an inch), and he said no, sorry. Are you kidding me? I understand charging extra for non-dairy milks - for lattes, aux laits, etc. You're getting 8-16 oz. of it. But to charge the same amount for a small splash makes no sense. And then to actually be a stickler about it is even more of a turn-off. I'm newly in the neighborhood often, and needless to say, this place will not be my go-to. I hope saving the 8 cents by withholding the soy milk was worth it!",3.0 star rating
"So now I am really confused.  I was back in town for an annual conference and staying a block away.  I don't mind the hike up the hill.  I made a mistake though.  From Yelp, it appeared the place didn't open until 8 but I think it really opened at 7 so I wish I had come earlier than I did.  Second mistake, I think this business- well it has definitely expanded taking over a second shopfront when it used to be just half the size but I think perhaps the success of the business either led to it being sold or under different management.  I did not see the Asian husband/wife team from before and instead of owners, it seemed to be employed staff.  Nothing wrong with that, just a majorly different and unexpected vibe.So the reason I came back was that although I am a huge fan of the breakfast sando, I really wanted to try the toast cup which I never had before.  I didn't even look for it on the menu or do a quick visual scan so it was quite a surprise when I returned to my room, and spilled my cappucino to find that it was tiny.  The toast part of it was different as well.  In past visits, I remember seeing them roll out a slice of actual sandwich bread for the toast and I'm not sure but thought it was two eggs with the bacon.  This toast was still good but not the sandwich bread and it was only one egg.  I finished it in two bites and was left wanting more.  This whole visit was a bit of a bust.  If you've never been before, I would still strongly recommend it to try but if you've been before, you too may be in for a surprise.",4.0 star rating

"The Beanstalk was near our hotel and I popped down the hill to grab some breakfast to take back to the hotel. The pre-baked egg cups (pictured) looked great on Yelp but it took waay to long for them to reheat and by the time I walked 3 blocks they were not warm anymore. Plus the egg was solid and the bread was like a crouton... Not what I was expecting.The next day we gave them a second try and it was equally underwhelming. The service was epically slow and they left the bacon off of my Cragel. I asked for it on the side but finished my Cragel before they even gave me an update, so we left.",2.0 star rating

"Updated review after the sexist and victim shaming comments from the company, welcome to 45's new America.In short: $15 for a latte and sandwich--never again. The latte was wrong and the cashier insisted I ordered a regular latte? I ordered a regular vanilla latte. I gave up, took it, tasted how bitter it was and drank water after requesting a water cup to the 3rd time. Oh and I asked for a water cup while waiting for my sandwich, they kept motioning and insisting it was there on an empty tray. I asked if I should cup my hands?The sandwich, literally as pictured: bread, cheese, lettuce, egg and bacon. No flavor whatsoever.

"I tried the second option on their Savory menu. It is Delicious. So much hearty flavor packed into a healthy possibly vegan meal. I'm so happy I found this place, albeit moving forward, I'll have to choose either a meal or a matcha. Being that everything is made in house, the matcha is a bit pricey. But I'm sure totally worth it. I tried the walnut milk in mine, first time trying walnut milk, not sure its my fav. but they have many other options, and I'm not afraid to keep trying. I'd recommend this place. Didn't take long, although they were packed when I arrived. It's a cozy place, with an otherworldly feel, sort of like if an apothecary housed a cafe.

"***3.5 Stars*** Dearly ""Beloved"", We are gathered here today to celebrate my *newest* discovery of the Beloved Café! Yep! This place is FIYAH! It's so fiyah that I still had to rate them 4 stars even though I didn't particularly love my drink. BUT... the atmosphere here alone is enough to make me come back. Seriously! What a relaxing and totally unpretentious café! The Mission sure has some amazing little gems, I tell ya! And, the Beloved is definitely one of them. Usually when I'm on 24th and Mission, it's because I'm craving Mexican food. But on this very day, I had a craving for a hot drink. A hot drink? Yaaas Boo! I was cold and needed something to warm me up. I Yelped up a few cafes and many of them were already closed (it was around 8pm). Beloved popped up and it looked pretty solid. So, off I went to explore. Got there and my little heart kinda melted. It's just.... sooo stinkin' CUTE! The vibes in that place were unreal. The baristas were madd chill. It's small but extremely cozy! There are a few couches to lounge on and a bar top where you can watch the baristas work their magic. I was intrigued! I sat at the bar and Damian gave me a menu to look at. But um... I kind of couldn't stop looking at him. Damian is eye candy, y'all! They've got some good looking baristas up in that joint! All the more reason to come back, right? But, I digress... So when I finally did look at the menu, the first thing that I noticed was that they use organic plant-based ingredients in all of their products (aka they're vegan friendly). I'm a tea lover and they have a whole host of different teas on their menu! Score! They also make fresh juices, smoothies, salads and bowls. After reading the description of their golden milk, I decided to give it a try. It was fun to watch it being prepared. But after drinking it, I quickly came to the conclusion that it was just... okay. I did taste some of the spices but the drink as a whole was a little flat. Maybe it was because it was made with almond milk? To be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of almond milk. However, the wonderful ambiance and great service is enough to make me come back. Their golden milk wasn't exactly my cup of tea (you see what I did there?), but that doesn't mean that it can't be somebody else's. I'm planning on coming back to try their smoothies and fruit bowls the next time that I'm in the area. Hopefully, I'll find something that I really like next time around.",4.0 star rating
"Here I am, sitting at the communal table on a sunny afternoon, admiring the beautiful light reclaimed wood counter and thinking about what I want to order. This tiny space is like a portal to a fairy's kitchen in the woods. It's across the street from the 24th BART station and you could easily mistake it for being just like another cafe in the grungy Mission until you walk in. There are tall ivy plants dripping from the ceilings and a cute little gong, yes, a gong, that welcomes you. I've never rang it but maybe next time I will. This was a weekday and I came here by myself and a book because I wanted to look cool while eating solo. Who am I kidding, I need more than a book to look cool. I'm on a 10 days cleanse and this is one of the few places that can accommodate my rather wholesome albeit restricting diet. So I figure body detox + digital detox, makes it acceptable to show up for food in sweatpants, no makeup on, and my hair up in a lazy bun. Yay! Beloved Cafe is known for their wholesome raw vegan nourishments. I feel like this is the tiny version of Cafe Gratitude without the adorable food item names... I wonder if they are connected somehow... Anyway, I made up my mind and ordered the Green Detox juice (notice a trend here?) and the Quinoa bowl with roasted veggies with added avocados because I'm usually the person that ask for extra avocados anyway. You can tell a lot about a restaurant by the quality of their avocados. Here at Beloved Cafe, theirs was hella sexy, I gotta say. It was muscular, ripe, and smooches easily with the fork. I appreciate the freshness of their offerings and it is most evident in their juice. Everything seems made to order, sans desserts, so things take a little longer to arrive, but hey, it's the antithesis of fast foods.So as I'm spooning my quinoa bowl, savoring the medley flavors of roasted sweet potatoes, kale, sprouts, avocado, and grains, and simultaneously reading a chapter, I feel a tapping on my left shoulder from the person sitting next to me. Well, what a pleasant surprise, I ended up making a new friend that day, someone who had an insight about what I was reading about. My new friend and I decided to order a dessert to share, it was something new that I haven't tried before. The raw vegan cheesecake arrived to our communal table pretty in pink and playfully adorned with berries, it was a sweet ending to a naturally authentic experience. I love Beloved Cafe and I highly recommend you coming here with a friend or by yourself like I did, stay off your phone, and say hello to the person sitting next to you. You might end up sharing a dessert with them ;-)",5.0 star rating
"When my friends and I were planning on attending a performance at The Dance Brigade's Dance Mission Theater, we looked for the best reviewed restaurant within close proximity of the Theater and found that Beloved Cafe met both criteria perfectly.It was a slight bit hidden in the sea of buildings on 24th Street, however, once we walked in, I had a good feeling that this was going to be a positive experience.Beloved isn't very big as while there is bar-style seating, it was mostly taken which led us to have to sit in a slightly cramped couch corner area. However, it was very comfortable so I have no complaints about it. The staff there were extremely attentive, and my friends ordered a juice and a couple of salads, while I personally got the Buddha Berry Smoothie Bowl and the Raw Vegan Cheesecake which had a coffee-style flavor that day.My friends got their food and drinks within 15-20 minutes while unfortunately mine took about 45 minutes. However, was the wait worth it? Let me put it this way. I'm not a vegan whatsoever and this isn't my typical scene as I'm very happy with various ethnic meaty foods, burgers, sushi, etc. The Buddha Berry smoothie bowl was hearty and flavorful beyond belief - not to mention the size of the bowl I thought was more than fair at the price point. I usually inhale food and it took me a while to finish, so needless to say, I'd have this again in a heartbeat. The real star of the show? The Raw Vegan Cheesecake. I usually don't eat cheesecake because while I enjoyed it as a kid, it just wore down on me over the years. This one on the other hand - HOLY COW! The mouse-like consistency with the coffee flavor set it over the top and made it the best cheesecake I'd ever had in my life. Everyone was happy with what they had gotten and virtually finished their plates, and the staff even surprised us with a sample of a shortbread brownie-style pastry that was again unbelievable. I don't know how Beloved does it, but if this is what they call health food, I'm totally in! Thank you so much Beloved for the incredible experience and showing me just how delicious healthy vegan/vegetarian food can be. I can't say enough about this place and will definitely be back.",5.0 star rating
"This place has it all. A lovely warm and comforting atmosphere, paired with delicious food and drinks. I've been here twice now. Most recently, I had their Red Velvet Smoothie Bowl and a homemade Chai. The bowl is packed with nutritious deliciousness and makes a decent sized breakfast (or snack!). The chocolate flavors in it are rich but the beet gives it a bit of earthy flavor that's unusual but absolutely delicious. The chai was perfectly spicy. Previously, I had their golden milk which did not disappoint! The people who work here are also great.

Oh, and the kale salad. I'm literally craving all of them now just thinking of them. I took my father in law here, someone that, by every measure, would not like a place like this (clean ingredients, super small, no meat or wine, etc.) and he actually loved it. He's a chatty guy and was super impressed with the staff's friendliness. I recommend this cafe to anyone--even those who think it might be a little too different for them.

"A local friend recommended Beloved when I was in town last year, and when I came back this year, I knew it had to be my first stop when I came in this trip.It's such a beautiful and welcoming place, filled with custom wood and and welcoming staff and customers. There's a huge wall of tea and a simple menu with great, fresh, healthy options. Kate was serving me and absolutely made this my favorite spot in town. She was so welcoming and caring and attentive and knowledgeable, it was incredible. She knew so much about so many of the amazing tea options, and shared so many  smart and fun facts and stories about the different kinds they have and cool properties and benefits. She was so sweet and offered samples along with it to me and the other guests, and just made the day of everyone in the cafe for the 3 hours I ended up staying. I ended up with a Quinoa Bowl and a pot of Long Jin which was perfectly brewed every time she filled up the pot with hot water, which was often. She also recommended the carrot cake muffin which capped off my day perfectly. I'm visiting the area and she recommended some other spots and events to check out which is so much appreciated.

"I love this cafe! My favorite place in the city and I find myself here once or twice a week. I believe everything is vegetarian (possibly vegan if you omit ghee from the dishes). Staff is pleasant, funny, and efficient. My favorite things here are the carrot ginger cupcakes that come with a nice topping and the occasional berry or two) and the healthy glow smoothie with walnut milk (who knew limes would work so well in smoothies??). You can get a nice pot of tea to share for under $10. I've heard the lentil soup (dal) is delicious with avocado and sprouts-- will need to try this. The reishi/mushroom latte is complex and taste; it kind of reminds me of a wholesome Chinese herbal soup that my mom concocts every now and then. The space is rather small but intimate, and anyone who comes here will appreciate the intricate furnishings and details. I'd suggest for groups of 3 or smaller. Also, if you're ordering its best to grab a menu from the front and make your way to the iPad toward the back so there's no muddled confusion of whether you're waiting for your food or seats.",5.0 star rating
"Writing a review for my favorite cafe in the bay area. I have never been disappointed with anything. Have tried here so farIt is a cute place, doesn't have a lot of space, but the cafe has a very welcoming staffFood1. Smoothie bowls - Are amazing, I have tried the red velvet bowl and it was yum2. Golden Milk - Growing up, I had something similar at home every morning in India, and this drink comes very close to home made ""Haldi Doodh"" ;)3. The raw cheesecake - My Girlfriends favorite dessert, this doesn't taste to sweet, and it seems very healthy. 4.Heavenly hot Cacao - We tried a larger portion of this, again delicious5.Quinoa Bowl - The bowl comes with a lot of qty, and it doesn't feel too heavy after trying this6. Island Tropic Smoothie - Delicious drink7. The best part about this cafe is the people here keep feeding you these yum tea tastings at no cost, we have been to this place thrice and have experienced it every timeGreat people, cute place, amazing variety of really healthy and high quality food",5.0 star rating
"Wow, I love this place already. The interior is beautiful with reclaimed wood and cups on the walls. Thee lights are really pretty in there. There's limited seating inside, but the smoothies are so delicious. I got an order of the island tropics smoothie to go and a 6 oz cup of chai. Total ran out be around $17 with tax, and I thought it was a lot when I was paying, but IT IS WORTH. EVERY. PENNY. The reason I say this is the following. 1) the service and the staff are great. They are super kind and knowledgeable, offering free samples of golden milk and tea to my and my 4 friends who came. I ordered a smoothie and they made extra so they let me keep the extra, which I drank on the spot with enough to share. The staff are just thoughtful in preparing your drinks. 2) the drinks were damn delicious. The green smoothie was just so flavorful and fresh and it just gave me some joy! I gave the smoothie to my dad who said it transported him to his childhood when he would drink fresh juices in india. The chai was super flavorful as well and my mom said she loved the taste of dried ginger and nutmeg along with the cashew coconut milk. I'll be back to try the food next time!",5.0 star rating

"Smooth, cappuccino. One of my favorite places to get a cappuccino. Compared to sightglass, which I also enjoy, it's much smoother. I could go for either but if you want to get specific, this is what makes blue bottles cappuccino stand out.This spot in particular had a nice interior.",4.0 star rating
"South Park is a hidden gem in SOMA. I live so close yet never visit as often as I'd like. Knowing that Blue Bottle Coffee is here might encourage me, though I have plenty of coffeeshops in Mission Bay where I live. I like that this Blue Bottle location is quite spacious. Once you order the front counter, you can choose one of many seats throughout the coffeeshop.Hopefully this doesn't get them in trouble, but I've brought my ESA husky into Blue Bottle and sat with him at the round table on the right-hand side of the place. Pretty sure they're dog-friendly because there's a water bowl right outside. Anyways, great spot to host groups or just catch up with a friend, which is what I did.Even if you don't hang out inside Blue Bottle, there's plenty of seating around South Park. Definitely sit outside if the weather is nice or go for a stroll around SOMA. Love the Blue Bottle brand and visiting all their locations. This is probably one of my favorites because it has lots of seating and isn't usually very crowded.",4.0 star rating
"Came in on a summer day for an iced coffee. Does anyone drink their coffee hot anymore? Anyways...I heard great things about Blue Bottle, so my expectations were fairly high for this new and trending coffee shop. The lady who helped me was very welcoming and explained the different blends they sold. It's always great knowing that your barista knows their stuff!I ordered the least expensive blend and got it with almond milk. The only issue with Blue Bottle that I have is that I feel like the price doesn't match the quantity nor the quality of what you get. After a few sips, I figured that it was smooth and mellow, but nothing seemed special about it.Perhaps I don't drink enough coffee to have developed a palate for it, but I surely didn't quite get the hype around Blue Bottle.",3.0 star rating
"I don't have a problem owning up to it - on several occasions in the past, I've outright said I didn't think Blue Bottle was worth the hype.  Maybe it's because my taste in coffee isn't discerning enough (Pike Place is my go-to), but I just never understood why Blue Bottle was so revered.  That is, until now.  After all of these years, I finally figured out what the problem has been - I just haven't been ordering the right thing!  I KNEW it couldn't have been me...ha!Out of all of the different ones I've been to (here, Mint Plaza, and the Ferry Building), this particular Blue Bottle is by far my favorite.  Besides how it's (relatively) close to my office, it's also got a great feel to it.  The minimalist look, the spacious feel (compared to its sister spots), the fact I've always been able to snag a seat the times I've stuck around to enjoy my drink...not much to complain about!  Most importantly, they keep the line/crowds moving surprisingly fast!While I'd always stuck with their hot drinks in the past, I finally decided to try something different and ordered the NEW ORLEANS ICED COFFEE with Cane Sugar, Milk, and Roasted Chicory ($4.25).  Now, I don't want to oversell this, but talk about a game changer!  Not only did it have just the right amount of milk and sweetness to it, but it packed the perfect caffeinated punch - not overly strong, but it had a delicious, robust flavor to it.  Delicious!Now, as tasty as my drink was, I'd be remiss not to acknowledge the fact that Blue Bottle is obviously on the pricey side.  Delicious to be sure, and certainly of better quality than the likes of Starbucks, but not all that cheap either.  Not that it would stop me from coming back again, not when I've finally discovered the drink to get to fully appreciate all that Blue Bottle has to offer!FOUR AND A HALF STARS rounded down for now.",4.0 star rating
"This Blue Bottle Shop has more flow customer coming and look more upscale than the Berkeley location.I adore their interior design of this corner coffee shop. It amazes and reminds me that, things don't always have to have a bunch of items in a room in order to catch ones eye. Best way to describe it is a simple and mellow vibe close to the SF ball park a couple blocks down.The iced coffee to me was a little bit bitter and water down. I'm pretty sure there was a couple of grounds inside the pitcher that were not caught by the filter. I like coffee strong and that was NOT strong at all. I notice they do ""pour overs"" big fan of that, and will be back soon to see how well executed they can make one.Just note this place does have support or have WIFI like most shops would. No pets are allowed in the shop, so be ready to tie your four legged friend outside, to the nearest pole within eye distance.",3.0 star rating

It's a great place to just have a 1 on 1 with your manager or if you're looking to catch up on some reading. My favorite drinks are definitely the New Orleans Iced Coffee and Mocha. Please note that they don't offer Soy Milk anymore, since it's not as environmentally friendly. They offer Oat Milk instead, which is just as tasty!",4.0 star rating
"I'm almost tempted to give this Blue Bottle a bad rating just so it doesn't get too busy lol Actually though...This is one of my favourite Blue Bottle locations, especially on weekend mornings when it's not too busy. The staff is generally friendly and helpful if you have trouble deciding what you want. If it's a nice day out, it's awesome to take coffee (and maybe a pastry) to-go and hang out on South Park nearby. If you do decide to stay though, there's plenty of tables and seating, making it a good place to work. (Not for too long though; it is a pet peeve when people stay at a coffee shop - any coffee shop - longer than they should and take up tables and chairs.) This location also has big windows with a lot of natural light, which I LOVE!",5.0 star rating
"Blue Bottle Coffee has quickly turned into a consistently good gourmet coffee chain in San Francisco. Their South Park location keeps up the tradition with a warm and open store on 2nd Street near Bryant.The layout is very nice with large picture windows and a white and light wood interior. They have the full menu with several coffee styles including espresso, pour over, and vacuum drip in a rather elaborate and beautiful device. Snacks and pastries are also available.The coffee just happens to be great here too. They have a good house blend with single origin espresso available. The espresso was pulled well with a wonderful flavor, especially when poured over a large scoop of gourmet vanilla ice cream!Service was great, although it does take a while to make a custom drink done right. The interior is almost as gorgeous as the customers enjoying their drinks inside and those unfortunate ones just walking by outside. This location is close to AT&T Park so expect crowds during Giants games. I'm used to great coffee in Sacramento, and San Francisco is really great too. Blue Bottle Coffee in South Park may not have Tweek running around, but you can get a great coffee drink anyway.",5.0 star rating

"I forgot how much I love Blue Bottle Coffee. Although there are a few location in Los Angeles, they're not easy for me to get to. I recently dropped by this location while in SF and just sat at one of their tables enjoying the Cold Brew and the sun beaming through the windows on my back. I wanted to try something different for once, but I defaulted back to a cold brew like I've always done anywhere else. I absolutely love the cold brew. BBC :-) is definitely on my list of top coffee shops. The staff are friendly, and the woman helping me ran through a few items on the menu before I made a decision. This location is very spacious, with tables to accommodate small and large groups. The perfect place to get some studying or work done. I love the open space, with glass all around to bring in a lot of light. There are a number of baked goods that will get your mouth watering. I was tempted to try one, but remembered that brunch was shortly after this stop.It's conveniently located near the park. I observed quite a few people who decided to bring their drinks and enjoy it there instead. There are benches for you to sit in and enjoy your brew. On a warm day in October, this is probably the perfect choice. Plenty of parking in the area too!",5.0 star rating
"Blue Bottle is my favorite coffee shop for times when I'm feeling a little fancier. It's right across from where I work, and the coffee cocktails are fantastic. Particularly, the coffee cocktail with orange and jasmine tea is my favorite thing to order! They have good snacks like cheese rolls and rhubarb pound cake. The atmosphere is beautiful and even if they're crazy busy the orders are always out fast. The only reason I won't give 5 stars is because it's suuuuuuper expensive. The coffee cocktails are not that much bigger than a shot and cost around $6! Also, this place can get CRAZY around that mid-afternoon slump when everyone needs caffeine.",4.0 star rating
"Very relaxing, lots of space, counters, table along the window, big community round table..Tables along the windows is great natural lighting for people to study and do their work. .Counter space meaning there's a bar where you can watch them make drinks. It's quite nice and relaxing. .Big community round table - great for large groups or one who wants to spread their work all over. .Drink - so I tried their elder berry sparkling water with cold brew. It wasn't my favorite, due to the flavor and not enough sweetness. It was just different, either love or dont like it. They were nice to let me switch back to my regular. .My regular to go to is the new Orleans. But the girl told me they have oat milk and I'm like yasss! It's one of my new favorites so this is how your order it. One new Orleans with oat milk.  .Of thing I noticed about their coffee is that its strong, and they serve you these big ice cubes which slowly melts and doesn't water down your coffee. .Overall this is one of my new blue bottle coffee spot to actually chill when I'm in the city. Comfy with space, and air flowing in and out which is quite refreshing. Thanks for reading and have a yelptastic day!",5.0 star rating
I came here because I was told this was one of the best coffee shops in the city. The environment of the store was nice (looked hipster and chill). The service wasn't as friendly as I would of expected but not bad. The coffee to me was just alright. I was expecting my mocha to have more flavor. Maybe I will try hot instead of ice next time. Still a great coffee place but would recommend philz before here.,4.0 star rating
"Fun fact: I used to work at a Blue Bottle when I was 20 years old. I'm ashamed to say that I totally embodied the hipster barista attitude mostly because I was 20 years old but also because that's who I worked with! Coffee hipsters with ironic mustaches who rode fixies. Oh, 2007. It is now 2019 and Blue Bottle is all grown up with its investor money, beautiful standardized minimalist interior design, and fancy floral arrangements. I grew up too and now instead of having a coffee hipster job I have an engineering semi-hipster job. Anyways, this is the location closest to my work and I go here twice a week. What I really appreciate about this location especially is that if ANYTHING goes wrong (they're out of the milk you wanted, they took too long, they gave you the wrong thing) they will do their best to fix the problem and then in addition will give you a card to redeem for a free coffee! I think this has happened 3 times so far and when it has happened  the mistakes were all not a big deal to me. But it was still cool that they do this to make sure you're happy. Hipster attitude has been completely eradicated! Go to Ritual for that lol. (I still love Ritual, JUST SAYING) I usually go for a single origin Africa drip coffee (hipster habits die hard) or a latte with oat milk.",5.0 star rating
"The revitalized South Park space has brought a much needed facelift to the neighborhood, and unlike the eye-rolling result seen on some aging Hollywood actresses, the effect has been neither jarring nor scarring. Yes, I'm talking to you, Meg Ryan. Fortunately I am too old - not for a facelift, mind you - but to play on the cool new jungle gym in South Park unlike a couple of entitled hipsters Jamie W. and I saw who thought nothing of sitting on the tire swing while actual children were waiting for them to leave.No, my entertainment comes from the caffeinated libations being served at the fresh-looking new Blue Bottle on the 2nd Street side of the park. What can I say about Blue Bottle that I haven't already said in the five other reviews I've written about at their other locations? Not much except they are certainly consistent. It's a lovely individual pour, and I selected the $3.75 Three Africas blend because I just assumed three was better than one (photo: bit.ly/2uPFpVD), even though the Rwanda blend was a dollar more. Go figure.There were the requisite baked goods including ridiculously large pretzel buns (photo: bit.ly/2w0joCp) and alluring sticky coffee pudding muffins (photo: bit.ly/2vnJSAp). Jamie and I stayed strong and kept our temptations at bay. Anyhow, as I was waiting, I was really enjoying the clean lines of the space. Very contemporary and most suitable for a South of market location. There was even a large round table commandeered by a silent group of presumed tech geeks, almost like they were hired as performance art (photo: bit.ly/2gIoTCW). I was just happy to take my coffee to one of the little metal stands in the park.

Cute little cafe with amazing drinks. I'm not a coffee expert or anything, but ever since Tierra Mia, I've learned to appreciate coffee. I've tried almost all the frappes by this point and I gotta say Horchata Frappe and the Mexican chocolate frappe are the ones!!! Hot or cold both never disappoint. Sweet. Creamy. Delicious. Really friendly and helpful baristas who will take the time to explain every drink and make it the way you want. Also reasonable prices for some coffee. Free and reliable WiFi as well as a couple outlets on the walls. Worth a try if you're in the area and need a cup of coffee!",5.0 star rating
"I had a good time at Tierra Mia, stopping by for a quick snack and coffee because I had been forced to get up early and rudely denied any coffee prior.The decor here is pretty cool, with some aeronautical antiques and comfortable chairs. It's a very casual place that I can definitely see people lounging around in.The service was very prompt as well, with it only taking a few minutes for my mocha and almond croissant to be delivered.The mocha was good if you like sweet coffee drinks, but to be honest I prefer less sugar and a more intense chocolate flavor. An extra shot of espresso and the removal of half the sugar would have probably been more to my liking. It was good, just too much like dessert for me.The almond croissant was also good, but reheating it by microwaving it doesn't leave me with a very good impression. I'd prefer it was reheated with dry heat, like a toaster oven, rather than internally steamed, which is what microwaving does. It wasn't ruined, just kind of suboptimal to me.Overall, if i were in the neighborhood, I would come here versus Starbucks or Pete's. But I'd go to Blue Bottle or Philz if that was available.",3.0 star rating

I would definitely come back in the future to get the Horchata Latte.Tierra Mia Coffee has a nice spacious cafe and the setup reminds me of a few places I've visited in South Florida in the college are by University of Miami. My only disappointment was that they didn't have many Cuban pastries - if they had some guava pastries or some Puerto Rican pastries then this place would be probably the best place I've been to.Still - major points for having a real Latin coffee and not some made up hipster stuff like most of SF.",5.0 star rating

Since I didn't want alt of caffeine, I ordered a decaf horchata latte with almond ""milk"" and couldn't have been happier! A small was $5.25, so a little steep, but I would order it again on an occasional basis.

Yes, the drinks are awesome here but who can drink them if they close at 5 and or open at 7:30am which is very late for a coffee shop?! The schedule here makes no sense.

"I've walked by this spot every time I walk on this part of Mission Street, but my inner clock was not dialed to coffee time until recently when I actually entered the cafe on a whim. I've actually been to the other Tierra Mia on Broadway in Oakland to meet a former colleague, but I threw balls to the wall and ordered one of their specialties, the sweeter than sweet Horchata Frappe (review: bit.ly/2xrOCDY). I noticed they serve that sugary confection here, but I tried to hold the reins tighter by ordering an 8-oz Cappuccino Italiano since it was a coolish afternoon even though I know it's a major faux pas to have cappuccino after 12 Noon (photo: bit.ly/2OEQT5O). I didn't get grief for my order, but I certainly got plenty of sugar as it was a most dessert-like drink for the middle of the afternoon.

"The atmosphere of this shop was great. Maintains a homey feeling while being modern at the same time. Personally, this was a great place to study for me. The shop plays soft music and the sound of the coffee machines isn't too loud. However, I'd suggest getting there early if you don't want to worry about getting a table. The shop started to fill up around 11 AM. The walls have plugs, but not at all tables are near plugs. The coffee was great here though! I thoroughly enjoyed my super foamy latte.

"Dropped off my boyfriend's mom at the hospital across the street and was looking for a coffee shop to pass some time. Stumbled upon this place. It was cute and homey feeling. Upon entering, there wasn't really anyone to greet me. Took them a while to notice I was there. She was nice when she came up to the register though. The whole ordering process had a feeling of confusion floating between me and the cashier. Not a big deal though. I ordered the Horchata Frappe with a shot of espresso added. MmMMmm good. The order came out about three minutes after I ordered it. It was caked in a nice wallop of whipped cream on top. The first sip was bomb oh my goodness so good. It really was an amazing first sip! As time progressed however, I found myself getting overwhelmed by it. It took quite some effort to drink. Maybe ordering a medium for myself wasn't the best idea. I'd be more than elated to come back and order it again in a size small! I was also recommended to try the Coco Loco.

"Founded by Julie Vandersmeech and Arnaud Goethals in 2015, the Howard Street location soon spawning an outpost at the Ferry Building and recently Noe Valley, it was shortly after 9:00am on a Tuesday that Vive La Tarte was found bustling, the sizable workspace filled by folks on their laptops or meeting over Coffee while a team of at least eight worked diligently throughout the immense kitchen.Belgian-inspired but infused with fun, artisan touches such as milling Flour on-site balanced by items such as the Instagram-friendly ""Tacro,"" it is at a distance that guests can see staff focused on tasks including rolling, folding and piping, the fact that each location offers something different each month virtually guaranteeing a following that will soon spread to Los Angeles.Clever enough to lure in both ""influencers"" and traditionalists, no small task in a city with outlandish real-estate and lots of competition, it is moving left to right that guests will find items both sweet and savory, a total of one dozen choices far from the shotgun approach seen elsewhere while additional items are made-to-order.Opting for a mix of traditional and modern, the five items selected tallying just under $30 after tax and tip, it was on bad footing that the experience commenced, the Almond Croissant frankly inedible thanks to what seemed like Frangipane with even more Sugar than usual while the follow-up thankfully fared far better thanks to thick Banana Pudding that somehow left most of the Viennoiserie still crunchy and awash with Ginger.Told not to miss the Monkey Bread by a trusted source, Vive La Tarte's choice to use individually laminated cubes bound by Butter yielding a texturally splendid specimen beneath granulated Sugar and bright with Turmeric, it was next Bombolini piped with Butter Cookies and Cream performed beautifully before finishing with an intense slice of Belgian Chocolate Cake flecked by Sea Salt.",3.0 star rating
"What a nice find in the city! I actually tried coming here once a year ago and couldn't find seats so left. This time, we luckily grabbed some stools on their communal table where my friend and I were able to get some work done on our laptop (although fair warning, there's no free wifi here!) The space is huge, spacious, well-lit, and just makes for a great working and meeting place. They even offer a little patio area to bring your furry friends!While you're at a coffee shop, one would usually grab a coffee or latte. I'm not much of a drink person, so I was ecstatic when I saw the baked goods behind the glass. Let me tell you, the baked goods is where it's at! I ordered the San Francisco Cheesecake ($6.50) and boy was it amazing! It was made with such a fluffy custard that just hit the sweet spot for me. I couldn't help myself with each bite for its airy texture yet dense flavor. Oh my goodness, just get the cheesecake here and you'll understand.",4.0 star rating
"Finally made it out to Vive La Tarte after hearing so much about the croissants and seeing so many pictures! Went with a friend and we arrived around 10:50 am, to find that all the specialty croissants were sold out except for the mocha croissants! Just means I have to come again then to try everything else. Food:- SF Cheesecake--$6.50My friend and I both declared that this was our favorite item out of all the baked goods we got. The cheesecake was so smooth and creamy, and a perfect balance between fluffy and rich and decadent. It was sweet yet still had a bit of a tang. My favorite part was the crust made of crumbled Speculoos cookies that were buttery and delicious. - Mocha Croissant--$5.00This croissant was humongous in size and packed with filling. When I cut into it, the croissant dough delicately flaked apart, and the cream inside oozed out. The flavorful, velvety, rich mocha filling inside was a delightful combination with the more airy, light whipped mocha cream on top. - Spinach and Goat Cheese Quiche--$6.50This quiche was soft and fluffy and not too dense. The goat cheese was also not overpowering and complimented the spinach well. Tips:- Come early if you want the specialty croissants. Before 10:00 am would probably be ideal. - Focaccia pizzas, SF cheesecake slices, and tarts are ready around 11 am, so if you want those items, don't come too early. - No WiFi but it's a big open space and probably a great place to study if you are able to snag one of the table seats.",4.0 star rating
The coconut cream croissant... ohmygawd. I'm going to have dreams about this one. The croissant is perfectly flaky and the filling is so light and delicious. And of course I've been trying to limit my croissants but now this?! Ruining me!!,5.0 star rating
"Another place I left until my very last day in the bay (my last 12 hours VS 4.5 years of living here LOL). Food 5/5: I got the very last black sesame orange croissant from their morning batch. Great choice! At first, it looked quite intimidating because of its size and the ample cream on top. It was super fluffy and had a unique flavor (what they are famous for). It was definitely on the pricier and calorie-heavier side but could be a yummy weekend treat!Ambiance 5/5: Pretty spacious and a lot of tables. Had I known earlier, vive la tarte would have been my to-go work spot. It was almost empty around 11 am on a Monday, too. I'm not quite sure if they have WiFi but, given the area, there is probably at least an xfinity hotspot.",5.0 star rating
"Super hipster little cafe that is conviently walkable from Civic center Bart. Be prepared to wait in line to order, wait a long time for food to come to your table, and possibly crouch uncomfortably on the stadium like steps if one of their limited tables is not available.Their menu is creative and the pastry case is enticing. For me, I sampled the taramind croissant, chilli cauliflower quiche, and smashed avo toast. The pastry was light, buttery and the taramind very faint. I loved the quiche - the egg was so airy and the chilli flavor was subtle and not over powering. The smashed avo toast wasn't my favorite even though it was beautiful. The poached eggs was slightly overdone and I thought the smashed avocado needed a little more salt. What I found odd was the almost pickles tasting green tomatoes. The initial bite into that was pungent and unexpected.",4.0 star rating
"The Pitch:Despite the two dollar sign worthy reviews and the slightly inconvenient location, Vive La Tarte is still a place that I encourage anyone to give a shot. Not only are there many delicious pastries, but there are also many scrumptious delights like their avocado toast or even their bacon egg breakfast! Did I mention fresh coffee? Yes, they heard that right! They have the best of both worlds! So I hope you take your time and enjoy my review!The Story:Well, this is my second time coming to this place, and honestly, the second time was as magical as the first! When you walk through the entrance, on the right side there's an area where people place their dogs and keep watch; whereas on the left side, there's numerous amounts of tables and seatings. From benches to regular chairs and even the large wooden stairs that can act as a seating for those who prefer that style. Honestly, I really love the ambiance (which I'll get to in a bit) and I love the spacious layout of the area. As you walk farther along the line, you'll see a large and long glass case, perpendicular from the seating and across from the coffee area ( which I'll get to in a moment as well), filled with numerous amounts of pastries. From creamy yet soft lemon meringue to an assortment of crossiants (my favorite!), Vive La Tarte really knows how to speak breakfast to the average customer! On the second time coming here, I ordered a chocolate crossiant ($4) and bought an avocado toast ($14). During the time I had to wait for the toast, I decided to sit down on the large stairs and tried my chocolate crossiant. I kid you not, this crossiant was like eating a piece of cloud, covered with a crunchy yet subtle crust. (If you don't believe me, I implore you to try it!) After I got the toast, waited 2 hours, and then finally got the opportunity to eat it, it was still pretty amazing! Although the egg yolk and avocado (which there was a prolific amount, almost to the point of disgustingly generous) made the toast very soggy, I still enjoyed every creamy bite I took. So don't mess around kids, this food isn't a joke!The Ambiance:I don't want to repeat what's there but to describe it, lots of wooden seating with lots of open lighting despite being indoors. If you think you've seen it all, you should try going to this place in the morning, where there's lots of sunlight: it's absolutely magical! I definitely do appreciate the coffee bar being in front of the food area simply because once you order the food, you can grab a nice cup of Joe! (Unless your name is Joe, then just grab yourself!) However, if you're not feeling a pastry, you don't need to go bother the pastry cashier! The Food:I really can't stress this enough but you HAVE to try it to believe it! The chocolate crossiant really is like eating a cloud dipped in batter then baked. And the chocolate is pretty rich, though I can't pinpoint what it is exactly, but I can say that it's on the lighter side of dark chocolate! The avocado toast is creamy and subtle, and it's not too overpowering! The avocado and eggs go really well together (I feel like that combo has been there since the creation of time!) The Review:Pros:- Great customer service (Always someone to clean up after you've done your part of the work)- Great pastries and drinks- Spacious place with lots of seating!- Definitely one of the best bakeries there are! (Yes, Holmes included!)Cons:- I'll think of one later when I can, but while you're bathing in your own saliva reading this review, let me just warn you that you have to clean after yourself like any normal human being in this fine establishment! (Haha, enjoy! c:0)Conclusion:I highly urge you to come to this heaven-sent bakery, where smiles are too prolific and the look of satisfaction is on every customer's face! (That is of course, unless you don't like pastries nor coffee. Then at that point, I recommend trying their toast and a sparkling water!) Please, please, please, if you've reached this point, it is not me begging you to go but rather your body craving this delicious bakery! As the French used to say... Vive La Tarte!

"A visit here for breakfast was the perfect way to start the day before catching an early show at the Orpheum Theater and then walking the  hoods.The food was excellent and the portions were very filling.  We had... - smashed avocado toast with pickled tomatillo, cherry tomatoes, feta, and sumac and - falafel & avocado salad with yogurt, red beet hummus, avocado, and pickled purple cabbage.Both dishes were almost too beautiful to eat.  The drip coffee was very good and came with unlimited refills.My only note of caution is that seating is limited and food comes slow.  So, as long as you have time, this can be a good bet.",4.0 star rating

"Came for the orange blossom za'atar croissant and was so glad I did. I would come again just for this flaky, herbal croissant with sweet honey paste filling on the inside. We also ordered a matcha latte, lemon tart, and cheesecake. The matcha latte is very standard and would reorder again. I enjoyed trying the lemon tart and cheesecake, but would probably try something different the next time I come by. (I prefer a more toasted, less shortbread-y crust.)",5.0 star rating
"This place is just so wonderful. It always smells like fresh bread or pastries and you can see everyone cooking behind the counter. It's a nice big opened space, so it's lovely to sit down and read and enjoy lunch. The croissants are so delicious, although a little heavy if that's not what you're looking for (if so, you MUST get the almond croissant, it's to die for). My go to item here is actually the falafel salad, which is really impressive. It has so much good flavor with the fresh falafel, yogurt sauce, beet, cucumber and light dressing on the lettuce. It's a little pricey, but can easily be split into 2 meals if needed! Recommend going in just to look at the beautiful food even if you're not eating and want a coffee or tea to go.",5.0 star rating
"Found this place on yelp when I was looking for breakfast spots in San Fran.  Vive did not disappoint. Has the feel of a modern, cafe. I really like the open layout which gives you views of the kitchen. I ordered the smashed avo toast which was great. They also have what look to be amazing pastries although I didn't try any. My only complaint is that they didn't have wifi which seems like a must for a coffee shop.",4.0 star rating
"Viva La Tarte has been on my list of places to try in the city for a while and I decided to go here before shopping on a Sunday afternoon. The place was pretty packed and the layout of the place is pretty interesting. You can either sit on the bleachers or the tables, there's a separate coffee bar, and it's an open kitchen. Seeing as there was no table seating, my friend and I opted for 2 pastries and some coffee. We ordered the earl grey crossaint and a slice of the SF Cheesecake, a latte, and a matcha latte.We ended up finding seats on the bleachers, and I found it quite difficult to eat. It's not that pleasant, but it's doable - I would imagine it would be a little difficult if I had ordered a Benedict. Anyways, both pastries were really good! The crossaint was perfectly flaky and the Cheesecake was extremely moist and the crust was bomb af - highly recommend both of these items! The drinks were good too! The matcha latte was really strong and you could really taste it. The latte was good, nothing special. Overall, I did really enjoy this place. I'm hoping next time I come there's table seating so I could try their other items, but their pastries are really good! I'd definitely try their other crossaints and desserts next time!",4.0 star rating

"Brought my parents to Vive La Tarte after touting this as one of the better croissants I've had in the city. I was a little disappointed at the lack of variety in croissants this time but I guess the layout changes for weekend service. The majority of the cases featured the flatbread pizzas or quiche. Still, we bought 3 of the 4 varieties of croissants available (black sesame, orange blossom, and plain butter) and a slice of the famed San Francisco cheesecake to share.We were piqued by the black sesame croissant but ultimately, it was our least favorite of the three. The cream/custard, aside from being a robust, dark gray, really did not have an iota of black sesame flavor which was disappointing. The orange blossom was pretty good though but ultimately, the traditional butter croissant was my favorite of the three this time. And between the butter croissant and the meyer lemon version I tried last time, I think I would pick the meyer lemon because in the realm of the best plain butter croissant in the city, I think Arsicault Bakery is still king.Where the croissants weren't all that this time, I did think the cheesecake was a winner. The crust was buttery, crisp, and had a slight cinnamon flavor. It honestly tasted like a biscoff cookie crust which was amazing! The cheesecake portion was fluffy and creamy, and not nearly as dense as a NY Cheesecake (which I honestly don't care too much for). The top could definitely use a little more refinement though - I thought our slice was a little too browned for a cheesecake.All in all, our spread cost us $20 with tip.",4.0 star rating
"Came here for the first time on a Sunday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised with the layout of the space. There is an open kitchen with pastries and food items at one side and a coffee bar at the other. There is table seating in the middle and also bench/bleacher type seating where you can sit on a mat. Definitely a unique space. You can order items that are already made or order items that need to be made like Benedict's and Salads. Me and my friend ordered a slice of Cheesecake and an Earl Grey Croissant, with a Matcha Latte and a regular Latte. Both the cheesecake and croissant were really good. The cheesecake was rich and creamy with a nice crust, and the croissant had a nice earl grey cream inside. Would definitely get these again and maybe try a different flavor croissant. The lattes were good as well. It was pretty busy so we sat on the bench. Not my favorite way to eat but it was certainly different. I'd come back to try their other items, hopefully there will be tables open.",4.0 star rating
"I went to the Vive kiosk at the Ferry Building (also opens at 8 AM), but their pastry selection was quite small (only croissants - plain, almond and the key lime).  I had my heart set on the donuts I saw on their Instagram (earl grey filled!) and decided to hop on BART.  Vive's main spot is BART accessible, you just get off at Civic Center, make a left down 8th Street away from Market Street and another left on Howard for a block or two.  The interior is quite large and there's a ton of seating making this a great spot to meet up with folks.  The selection here included pain au chocolat, strawberry shortcake croissants, a number of different types of quiche, and more.  I opted for the strawberry shortcake and key lime croissants, and one of the matcha filled donuts.  I was a bit bummed that they didn't have earl grey, but I understand that the flavors must rotate.  I'm following their Instagram and hope to stay alert to what flavors may be available on any given day.The donut was absolutely delicious.  I love the sugar covered exterior, the doughy interior and the touch of matcha like custard within.  My only request would be for a bit more custard.  As for the croissants, I'm not a big fan of meringue in general so I wasn't in love with the key lime topping (as beautiful as it is!); however, I preferred the custard filling to the kind of strawberry jelly interior the shortcake croissant had.  That said, my ideal croissant would have the whipped cream topping of the shortcake with the custard interior of the key lime.  Personal preferences aside, both croissants were not too buttery and absolutely delightful (crisp, flaky exteriors and slightly doughy interiors).  If I didn't have something to rush off to this morning I definitely would have stayed to hang out.  This is a great bakery/cafe and I will definitely be back!Specialty Croissants - $5/eachDonuts - $3.75/ea",4.0 star rating

"Great foood and pastries here! I especially love the salmon rice green tea soup bowl and the Katsu sandwich. The salmon bowl was full of unique flavors, just the right amount of salty and sweet, and it was very comforting. The Katsu sandwich was also bomb; the bread was surprisingly soft and melted in my mouth. However the drinks were just okay to me.Tried both hojicha latte and matcha latte but wasn't special.Wish they served normal lattes here/coffee options! Highly recommend for their food!",4.0 star rating
"I've been coming here on and off for a very long time.I love the decor, the treats (Green Tea Matcha is my favorite) and the drinks (Green Tea Latte is my favorite, notice a trend?)I think the only thing, I dislike is their sit-in policy. I understand how it works especially given the limited space (and having worked in the industry) however my girlfriend and I didn't appreciate the comments we got when we wanted to briefly nibble on some stuff before heading out.Overall, I hope you expand to the east bay because crossing the bridge/riding bart isn't always convenient.",4.0 star rating
"I really wanted to like this place but it just fell short for me in every way. I enjoy and frequently purchase matcha drinks around the two cities I live in; I have found that I dislike any added sweeteners because high-grade matcha already has sort of a tinge of sweetness to it. I read a lot about this location and during my last trip home I figured it was time to give it a shot. When I arrived around 3:30pm it was crowded. I found two tables open and they were filthy, I asked to have one wiped down and they took that as ""remove last patrons dishes only"". Being as I wanted to just enjoy my matcha I let it go. I ordered the regular iced matcha latte with almond milk only, and found the drink lacking any depth. It tasted mostly of almond milk with a tiny bit of matcha. I figured stirring might help, but it only brought forth major chunks of matcha. I decided to just drink it quickly (I do not like waste) and be done with this experience. I may have just had a bad experience, and did not try any foods, so it could be worth the food. The prices were typical of SF, only I felt the matcha was not worth it at all.",2.0 star rating
"I was looking forward to this place because my American experience with matcha flavored drinks and desserts has been a good one. When I got the matcha latte, I was surprised that it was not sweetened like I am typically used to. Instead, the matcha flavor was very pure and seemed to be high quality. Honestly, I can't really tell the difference between good and bad matcha because I don't have it often enough. But the fact that it didn't need to be sweetened made me feel like it was good quality. The ratio of milk to matcha powder was good too because it was not too bitter.I went all out and between two people got two entrees, two drinks, and dessert. It was a filling and satisfying meal. My favorites were the katsu sandwich, hojicha latte, and matcha cake. If I were to come back, it would be mainly for late afternoon tea because the most unique part of this place is the dessert.Another thing I really appreciate is the attention to detail for everything! Examples: 1. The katsu sandwich is so square, and the one and a half sandwich portion is very smart. 2. The interior! Nicely designed, sleek, and calming wooden furniture. 3. Bowls carefully framed the food so that you felt like you were eating something special. 4. Waiting list for a table so that there is order. Even though it feels calming and casual like a cafe, the experience is more like a sit-down restaurant.",4.0 star rating
"I'm always in search of a place with good tasting matcha. Matcha in the state is always super sugary, or tastes like mint or melon, or the taste is masked by other ingredients. I heard of this place and planned to go there the next time I was in the area for work. Parking is a bit of a hassle because it is in the Mission, but I lucked out with a metered spot right in front (the credit card slot for the meter was jammed but I was able to pay on an app that didn't require me to make an account). I walked in, menus were right at the entrance - I came in just for a drink and maybe a sweet treat but just from glancing at the food options, it seemed pricey (even for Japanese food). I ordered a hot matcha latte and a Stonemill chiffon cake (staff recommended the cake, I'm glad I took her recommendation). The price was reasonable for these two items, I took a seat and had to wait a while to get my drink. The cake came right away, a ginger Matcha latte came my way first about five minutes after I had gotten a seat and then it took another ten minutes for my latte to come. Wait to get a latte was unneccessary (even if it is good, quality matcha - every matcha latte in Japan is with real matcha and it doesn't take this long). Thankfully, both the latte and chiffon cake were delicious, super rich in matcha. The latte was closer to the lukewarm side so that was a bit disappointing. One thing to note is there is no wifi, so make sure you are coming to enjoy good company, read, and/or work offline!",4.0 star rating
"Overall - wide variety of matcha items and the matcha flavor really came through and felt concentrated in the items we ordered. We tried matcha affogato for the first time along with matcha latte, and a matcha cookie. I would give 5 stars based on providing the authentic matcha flavor alone, but the overall flavor/taste wasn't what I hoped for a dessert place.Pros - really intense matcha flavors in the affogato, which was really in-your-face aggressive. I wasn't sure what contributed to the overall bitterness (the fact that it's an affogato to begin with or the amount of matcha put into it, etc) but it had a really great floral bitterness that balanced out the creamy ice cream, as any affogato should. The matcha latte was left very authentic, as I didn't taste any sweetness in the initial taste. I liked the fact that you had the flexibility to decide the sweetness level on your own.Cons - while I enjoyed the matcha intensity, I wouldn't necessarily come back for desserts that are strongly bitter in taste (completely my own personal preference). Also, the cookie was just okay - it wasn't as intense or memorable.",4.0 star rating
"So so so good. I'm a philistine and always wish the hot drinks would be hotter, but I know that's not how you're supposed to enjoy matcha, so I deal.I've had the regular cheesecake, the ginger matcha latte, the regular matcha latte, and the sausage gruyère pop tart. I would get any of these again, but the pop tart is definitely a buttery treat and not a filling ""meal.""Can't wait to come back for more.

"Been missing japan lately so came here to appease my cravings. It's a cute shop in the mission district and the interior has that Japanese minimalistic aesthetic to it. I wanted to order their Katsu sandwiches, but I came here for a little dessert after lunch and was too full to try it. Gotta save it for my next visit ! I ended up ordering two matcha lattes - one cold one hot, and a matcha cheesecake. The matcha lattes were good. The hot one had some cute latte art on it! However, I felt that the cheesecake was lacking. I only tasted the sugar and no matcha. Wouldn't get again",4.0 star rating
"This is such a cute space, especially nestled in the Mission neighborhood. As you walk in, you get in line as you pass through all the pastries lined up behind the glass; which look amazing I might add. After ordering, you are then seated. The entire decor is minimalist, clean, and modern that really does transport you to Japan.Soon enough, a server came around to bring us our drinks and food. I had the Matcha Latte ($5) served iced while some of my other friends tried the Hojicha Cold Brew ($4) and Genmaicha Brewed Tea ($4). As much as I love matcha, the drinks were rather a-okay. Since we had just ate, the four of us shared an order of the Katsu Sando ($16), which came cut into 3 little sandwiches. The pork cutlet was tender and crunchy paired with some shredded cabbage and tonkatsu sauce. While the sandwich could've just a bit more flavor, it was still delicious and juicy.I like that Stonemill Matcha gives you a little taste of Japan with some unique specialty items from food to pastries. It's the perfect place to grab a quick bite, first date, or catch up with a friend. I'd come back here for the environment for sure, even though I found the food and drinks to be mediocre for the price.",4.0 star rating
"I would advise any matcha lover to stop in at Stonemill Matcha. This was my first time visiting on vacation, so I had to get a taste and see what this place was all about. I had been walking everywhere around the mission district one day and really needed a refreshing pick-me-up in the afternoon. I arrived around noon on a Friday to a line forming out the door (in Japan​ this would signify that a place is really good). Luckily, the line moves pretty quick since two workers are taking orders. They have menus near the entrance while you wait your turn in line, so you have some time to prepare before you approach the counter. Their selection of drinks, desserts and food items all look appealing. Being a first-timer here my first inkling is to try everything (sadly, I couldn't). I'm more of a grab-and-go type of person when I'm on vacation, so I decided on a quick drink and dessert this time. The Mizudashi 水出し was an excellent drink choice for me. The word 'Mizudashi' means cold brew in Japanese and once I read that I was sold. The taste of their matcha is high grade and not super bitter/grainy at all. It seemed like they mill the matcha very fine in this drink which is why it was so smooth yet still potent enough to seem like you are drinking a green tea cold brew. I wasn't too hungry at the time but I felt like I had to try at least one bakery item to go with my drink. I was eying their matcha cream puff pastry's (reminded me of Liliha Bakery Coco Puffs in Hawaii) and cheesecake as well but decided on something simple and easy. I got their Shokupan Toast- a housemade milk bread that comes with a side of matcha butter and anko jam. Although this item is very simple (there's nothing fancy about bread and jam), I felt that eating this bread with the anko jam they include with it is what sets it off. I would buy their anko jam separately if they sold it. The matcha butter was ok, but nothing special. I really loved the ambiance and attention to detail of this place (made me miss Japan). I had a good first impression! I'm sad that this business only resides in San Francisco because if they ever wanted to expand, I think their next location should open up in Hawaii. I know a lot of matcha lovers here that would eagerly await a matcha shop like this and embrace them with open arms.",4.0 star rating
"""I've never seen you so happy eating food."" - my friend. Been trying to pay them a visit for months now and so happy that I finally did!Came here on a Friday afternoon and this establishment was packed! Luckily, there was still seating available for us to sit and enjoy our food.The interior is modern, cohesive, and clean. The service/staff were efficient, kind, friendly and helpful.What I ordered:Creampuff - Matcha & Black Sesame ($5/each): Sweet enough to appreciate the essence and flavor. Not sweet like the typical American creampuffs. Definitely, not as powerful or sweet like a choux. Very good and can definitely taste the matcha and black sesame. Katsu Sando ($16): Okay, the star of the meal! It looks simple but is made very well. The sauce and cabbage compliments the perfectly crispy & flavorful pork cutlet. It was sooooo goooood! I will definitely be returning for more. Matcha Latte ($5): my friend who loves matcha ordered this and claims it's a 8/10.

"What a unique experience! You line up, order, are given a number, and wait to have someone seat you. We waited about 15 minutes to order on a Saturday afternoon and the clean and modern place was buzzing. Highlights for us included the matcha cream puff, matcha cookie, and matcha cream pie. I think the pie was my favorite because of how smooth and creamy it was. We could've done without the black sesame croissant. It just didn't have that strong of a black sesame flavor, which I was hoping for. I really liked my sparkling matcha drink. It basically tastes like an iced carbonated matcha tea. My friend got the sparkling matcha with yuzu, which we both preferred. Little did I know ahead of time that they have savory menu items! Would love to go back and try one of their lunch items and also their cream puff with matcha ice cream ($1.50 more than the matcha cream puff). I'd love to try their hot matcha drinks too. Service was friendly and you can order more once you're seated. There are some tables for outdoor seating.",4.0 star rating
"Beautiful space with above average food. I haven't tried many of the drinks but most of the food I've gotten here has been good but expensive for what it is. It's a very popular spot, so if you come at a peak time be prepared to compete for tables.You order at the counter first before receiving a number and sitting down. Your order will then be delivered to you. This system does result in a lot of people hovering for tables, which is a little unpleasant, so I would try to come at an off hour if this is an issue.Recommended:-Matcha chocolate mochi ($4) - delicious! My main complaint is the price to size ratio - it's a quite small piece of chocolate wrapped in mochi. (4.5/5)-Ginger matcha latte ($5.50) - it's good, feels very wholesome. (4/5)-Katsu sando ($14) - tender and juicy pork katsu between soft and fluffy bread. The breading wasn't crisp though, so the texture overall was more soft/wet. Also, the basket looks really cute but makes the sandwich a bit hard to eat. (3.75/5)-Yuzu meringue tart ($5.50) - mostly good but the curd was too sweet for me, and the matcha in the crust didn't add anything imo. (3.75/5)OK:-Black sesame cream puff ($5) - choux is excellent, but the cream has barely any black sesame flavor so I would get the matcha cream puff next time. It's not very sweet, (3/5)-Kyoto matcha cheesecake ($6) - tastes exactly how you expect. Good but it's something I could make at home. (3/5)-Matcha roll cake with cinnamon adzuki cream ($5.50) - kind of average. The dominant flavor is cinnamon, and then red bean; the matcha taste isn't very strong. Seems festive (so probably something I would have liked to eat more in December). (2.75/5)",4.0 star rating
"I saw Stonemill Matcha on my friend's Instagram story and was really excited about a place helmed by an Asian chef making delicious things out of matcha. I wish I could've tried everything, and regret that I didn't get to try the matcha cream pie, but I did opt for getting the matcha cream puff and the black sesame almond banana croissant. The matcha cream puff was good, but not amazing, but the black sesame almond banana croissant was incredible. Whomever came up with this knocked it out of the park - the banana and black sesame flavors really work in a way that isn't quite expected. My friend who loves to cook and experiment in the kitchen loved the croissant so much she's going to try to recreate it in her own kitchen. I'm definitely glad I stopped by here. This is a really cute bougie little cafe/bakery, with people and their laptops doing work, but also a great place to catch up with a friend. It's sleek and modern, and I love the wood tables. It was busy when I got in, but there was a table or two which was perfect. I'd definitely recommend checking this place out.",5.0 star rating
"Came here on a Sunday morning at around 9:30am and it wasn't busy at all, which was a pleasant surprise. The place was surprisingly large on the inside, from the outside it looks like a small place. But there was plenty of seating inside.The staff were very friendly and described the various menu items in detail when we told them it was our first time there! I ordered the black sesame banana croissant and the matcha cream pie, with a matcha latte. The black sesame croissant was great! It was sweet, but not too sweet and had subtle black sesame with a fairly obvious banana taste. I wish there was more black sesame because it was great! On the inside there was the banana and black sesame sauce and on the outside was a harder dry black sesame paste.The matcha cream pie was delicious too, the crust was a bit too dry and brittle for my taste. But everything else about the pie was super tasty - it had great balance, really fluffy, light cream and that delightful matcha taste.The matcha latte was not bad, I wish it was sweeter though!I'd definitely come back! A great asian fusion place!",4.0 star rating
"Came here on a Monday morning and it wasn't too busy! I absolutely loved the ambiance in the cafe as the interior design and even the silverware/plates matched and complemented each other. We got our food pretty quick. We ordered:+ Matcha Latte (4/5)Probably one of the better matcha lattes I've had. Decently strong matcha flavor and I felt energized after. Just the right amount of creaminess. + Matcha Cheesecake (3.5/5)Pretty standard cheesecake flavor. I wish the matcha flavor would've been more potent but still enjoyable nonetheless. Paired well with the latte!Prices were definitely the higher side for what we got (~13 including tax). I wanted to order more dishes to try but didn't want to spend too much. Come here on a weekday morning if you can to avoid the crowd. Either way, this place is worth checking out for all matcha fans!",4.0 star rating
"I've walked by this new spot so many times and have been so curious to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised to find out they have legit lunch entrees too!THE WAIT: None for two of us on a Friday at about 12:40pm.THE SERVICE: Professional, friendly, efficient.THE COST: $25.30 total (including tips) for a lunch entree and a dessert.THE FOOD: * Chicken Okayu ($13) - 5 starsMy friend recommended this and I went with this. Sounds simple and uninteresting (and as much as I love rice porridge, I associate it with simple Saturday morning meals with the family and not something I'd normally pay for in a restaurant), but the flavors and especially the textures were spectacular. Plus, this was filling but tasted very healthy. * Matcha Cream Pie ($6.50) - 4 starsGreat balance of an indulging, yet not too sweet/heavy dessert. Crust was a bit dry, to be picky!",5.0 star rating
"I love matcha and cute desserts and that means I love Stonemill Matcha. I got the matcha latte, cheesecake, and matcha cream puff filled with cream (you can also get it with soft serve). Everything was tasty with a light matcha flavor. The cheesecake was especially light and fluffy. The wait was long but the line moved pretty quickly. After you order, the staff will seat you which reduces overall chaos. This cafe is a little pricey, but I would come again if I wanted to treat myself!",4.0 star rating
"Beautiful, clean, airy, light-filled space. We came here around 4.30pm with a friend and there were a few tables open. It is nice and quiet so you can have conversations. Their matcha was hands down the best matcha I've ever had. I drank every single last drop of it, no bitterness and clumps at the bottom like many other places tend to. I had their ginger-matcha latte with oat milk. It would be nice if they didn't charge a WHOLE DOLLAR EXTRA for almond/oat milk. My matcha + croissant order came to around $14-15 (that's a lot).Serve ware is gorgeous ceramics too. The matcha croissant was delicious, good to share because it's very filling. We also had the matcha cream pie that was just enough sweet and fluffy. Cashier could've smiled a bit, but at least the food runner was very friendly gentleman.",5.0 star rating

"This was a short coffee stop while waiting to be seated for breakfast at a place nearby. We walked into this small coffee shop, and ordered some cappuccinos. Our cappuccinos were served on to-go cups, but that was not an issue.The place was ok, although it could use better decor. The coffee came out just fine, and gave me the jolt of caffeine I was looking for. They have outside seating as well, so we sat outside to take in some air. This coffee shop sits in an alright neighborhood, with plenty of food options around. Parking can be a pain around here, so keep a good eye out for a spot.",4.0 star rating
"What I like about this place? It's chill! On a Sunday afternoon every other place is packed, so I came here to get some work done and have a reason to get out of the house. This place is perfect for that. Definitely less hip and trendy than some of the cafes around, but cozy nonetheless. And affordable. I easily found seating and ordered an Almond Milk Latte at the counter. Wow, that one really blew my mind. Loved every sip of it and would come back just for that. I'm not sure what almond milk they used, but it was a game changer. You know, some almond milk tastes like you have just swallowed a piece of sand paper. Not super sweet, nor too dry. Will definitely be back to check out the rest of their menu. Thanks Cafe Murano for giving me a break from the lines around Pac Heights!",4.0 star rating
"#111/2016The coffee was just right, strong but not too strong. I asked for a medium cup, paid, they poured and handed me a small cup.Still non-caffeinated, my fingers fumbled around my bag feeling for some quarters (only 4 hours' sleep) to find the difference and the owner waved me off with a friendly smile.I was about 2 minutes away from cranky, I malfunction when tired. I bet it was my screw up and they were nice. Thank you.PS Their granola yogurt & fruit cups looked good and they had tasty-looking baked goods.",3.0 star rating
"Comfortable cafe with wifi and some good food items. They have the best oatmeal bowl in the area--old fashioned rolled oats in milk topped with plenty for fruit!

"Quaint little coffee shop themed out with French posters. Free Wi-Fi so it's a great place to sit and chill or study. Outlets are also available. Parking is a hassle though. Coffee quality is actually not bad, but more on the sweeter side so I always ask to lessen the sugar content. They close early at 5! But other than that it's one of my favorite grab and go coffee stops when I'm in the area.",4.0 star rating
"A cozy cafe with attentive owners. In the morning, it may feel like a busy grab-and-go place with espresso drinks and a range of breakfast options (my favorites: lox bagel and oatmeal - both come with fresh fruit). Later in the day, it may feel like a chill living room where freelancers are welcomed to hang around (there is wifi, plenty of outlets, and good tables). The vibe is low key and pleasant - there is usually nice music inside, and there are a couple of tables surrounded by flower pots outside. I see only 3 drawbacks:1) They close at 5pm. That's too early. Maybe bring back the beer/wine and keep open until 8?2) The juicer is super noisy. While I love the fresh OJ, maybe the juicer can be used somewhere in a back room.3) The tables get very messy during the day - the staff should wipe them regularly as they are picking up empty cups and plates.Still, a great place!",5.0 star rating

I love ditch crunch but theirs was more like a dinner roll texture. Overall though the sand which was very good.Now I really liked the coffee. I got a latte and the espresso in the drink had a solid flavor and I would defiantly order it again from here, if in the area.The staff is very friendly and they are fast at making the coffee drinks.

So...Today was my fourth visit, and they surpassed expectations again.  I've tried six different menu items, and they're all prepared to perfection, creative, and amazingly delicious.  Try the Mash Up and add a sausage. It. Is. Ridiculous. The shrimp and grits will rival any in the city as well.  The Southern Belle is astounding - a genius take on a waffle by using red velvet and cream cheese frosting. Prepare to drop the mic. The owners are usually working the truck and are friendly and passionate. Their story is awesome, so if they're not busy, get to meet them; it makes an amazing meal even better with some personalization. Happy eating!",5.0 star rating

"Light at the end of a long and dark tunnel. [Insert joke I normally insert here.] I just got off a phone call that gave me hope, but we'll see how it goes....I stopped by Spro Coffee Lab on a sunny Sunday afternoon. The sun shining, a light breeze blew through, there were fluffy dogs waiting to be petted, children eating ice cream. It was all so perfect. [If that sentence doesn't set up the rest of this review to be dismal, I don't know what does.]On to the actual review! I got the umami bomb (avocado, black truffle citrus ponzu, furikake, black sesame, togarashi chili & ikura salmon roe on sourdough rye), the special breakfast toast (2 hour sous vide egg with truffle mashed potatoe on sourdough rye), and the coco de mer (tcho dark chocolate, coconut, SPRO, condensed & fresh milk). At first, I marveled at how affordable the prices were (~$8 for the bread and ~$5 for drinks) vs. the other food trucks, but then I saw that the portions were definitely smaller than average. Presentation was definitely their forte, but including the relevant utensils (straw, fork, etc.) with the meal was not.The umami bomb was very Insta-worthy but the taste was just ok. The ikura was pretty firm and a good flavor. The avocado was decently ripe. The truffle flavor didn't really come through. 4/5 on presentation, 3.25/5 on taste, 3.25/5 on valueThe truffle mash on the breakfast toast was actually really truffly and I enjoyed that. The yolk on the egg was not too runny (more gelatinous), whereas I would have preferred a true soft boiled egg. Same points as aboveThe coco de mer coffee was actually one of the better coffees I've had in a while. The coconut taste didn't come through at all (a plus for the coconut-disliking bf), but was perfectly smooth. The dark chocolate was balanced by the milk (I would have preferred a dark chocolate drink, but this was good too). 3.5/5 All of their drinks looked so creative and refreshing-- the food snob in me will likely be back for these!",3.0 star rating
"This is a review specifically for their red velvet waffle with cream cheese frosting. I was interested in their food offerings, but they were already out of a few items I wanted to try at the ice cream festival.

Hope to try some of their other foods sometime.",4.0 star rating
"People joke that Millennials specifically ones in SF and NYC will never be able to afford a house.Why? Because...avocado toast. I never buy avocado toast so I can't relate. I refuse to pay $10-$16 for something anyone can make with ingredients made from the farmer's market for a fraction of the cost. That $10-$16 is going towards a liquid diet of craft cocktails. My morals may go out the door afterwards but hey...(Just don't tell my dad!)But yea, unless I find a filthy rich (AND insanely desperate) guy to marry me, I could never afford a house in SF. Anyhow, I've been following the SPRO coffee truck (inside Spark Social) since they opened for their Umami Bomb and was super excited to finally try it when we had a teambuilding event across the street. These days, food trucks are a dime a dozen but all the unique and photogenic creations I saw for SPRO really caught my eye. Plus, their solid 5 star rating gave me high hopes. It was going to be my first time ordering avocado toast...Not just any basic b*tch avocado toast but the Umami Bomb, avocado toast WITH black truffle citrus ponzu, furikake, black sesame, togarashi, chili, ikura salmon roe, sourdough rye. The combo sounds like its name - a flavor bomb! And, it's only $7.50 which is a steal in the city of bourgeois toasts: bit.ly/2xHQusY.  Sadly, the avocados were not even close to being ripe so they were hard and bitter. There was too much ponzu so the toast also ended up tasting sour. Bitter + sour is not a good combo. I had my co-workers try it and they agreed. On the plus side, I like that it's served on sourdough rye as a healthier carb option.SPRO specializes in coffee drinks but I don't drink coffee so I ordered their Fifty Shades ($5) which is their take on milk tea with earl grey tea. The friendly cashier told me that you can't adjust the sweetness and that their milk tea is lightly sweetened. Perfect! I usually order my milk teas at 25-50% sweetness because I like good tea flavor. Another sadly...the Fifty Shades was cloyingly sweet so it tasted like sugar milk, not milk tea. I ended up giving it to my co-worker who usually orders her milk tea at 150% sweetness. The staff was really nice so 3 stars for that and the creativity of their items. I probably went on an off day so I'm hoping my return visit will be stellar like others...",3.0 star rating

I'm a big time coffee lover and I usually go with the basic coffee drinks, but Spro had such a unique variety of different drinks on their menu that I had to go with something different so I went with their V for Velvet drink. I really enjoyed my drink. It wasn't too sweet or too bitter. My boyfriend ordered the orange blossom which I got to try out and kinda regretted not getting lol. The orange blossom was one of the most unique espresso based drinks I've ever had because of it's fruity flavor! I'm usually never in the SF area, but if I ever see Spro around I'd definitely give another one of their drinks a try again.",5.0 star rating
This is definitely a hidden gem in SF. This is a good truck style coffee shop located in the foodtruck area. Not only is the coffee good but they have an amazing selection of Japanese inspired drinks AND food. My favorite thing to get here is the Umami Bomb. Literally so good I tell my friends it's Umami Bomb.com. It's basically a Japanese twist on avocado toast.  It's hard to admit it sometimes but avocado toast is delicious and you can totally be basic and eat it all up. The owners sometimes bring their golden retriever as their welcoming committee. Super sweet people and amazing coffee and food. Highly recommended.,5.0 star rating
"I can see why Spro was so highly recommended by all my friends!My friend and I came at 12:45 on a Sunday. Sadly the Umami Bomb avocado toast was sold out, I was looking forward to that! I got the Southern BEL, red velvet waffles with cream cheese frosting (play on words with belle and Belgian waffles, ha) and Fifty Shades Earl Grey with oat milk. My friend got the Steak & Eggs plate which was 2 sous vide eggs on sourdough toast with ribeye steak, and also the ""V"" for Velvet coffee. The drinks came out first and were delicious, but extremely sweet. My waffles were the perfect combination of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and the cream cheese frosting was good (although I wish it were more drizzle-able). My friend's sous vide eggs were SO beautiful and tbh I wish I could've eaten her plate. The ribeye was nicely flavored too although it might have been better medium rare.Overall, I need to come back for the avocado toast and mochi waffles, and I can see myself visiting Spro every weekend...",4.0 star rating

It is very small though :( one is diet size, two is more of a meal.I also love their matcha / geisha kiss drink, and I always substitute with oat milk! One of my few places in SF that has oat milk.

I tried the Shiro Matcha (iced) and the white chocolate flavor almost danced with the matcha! It was an interesting combination but as a matcha lover I had to try it, and have no regrets.

"My hubby and I are coffee freaks, and one of our favorite things to do while traveling is to visit local coffee spots. We found Spro on Yelp after a morning yoga class and were exited to see that it was located in the most adorable food truck park. It's located in the corner of the lot and is a gorgeous red trailer. There was a short line of customers but the girl at the window took orders quickly so there wasn't much of a wait. We both ordered single origin pour overs for $4.50 each since that's the best way to enjoy really great coffee! My hot drink, was smooth with the most beautiful floral undertones and made the perfect start to a lovely day in San Francisco.

"Quick Summary- Interesting names that makes me want to try them- Friendly barista- Wait time can fluctuate depending on the amount of staff- Coffee isn't sour or bitter I decided to grab a cup of coffee before leaving Spark Social, so I went to the one food truck that serves coffee. A work colleague ordered coffee from this place earlier, and for some reason, it took her more than fifteen minutes to return to our table. However, when I went, my order arrived within five or so minutes. I think it was because there were two baristas working (she said there was only one handling all orders).I am very grateful to have tried the coffee here because it has been a while since I drank coffee this good. I have ordered the cafe latte, so I didn't try the coffee on its own (as a house blend), The coffee has a very fruity and nutty taste, and the milk made the drink very creamy. There was no sour taste and there was a mellow bitterness. It was almost like drinking a very fine hot chocolate. The barista at this food truck were very friendly. When I wasn't familiar with the menu (dippy?) they explained it in detail. I also liked the quirky names for food. Next time I want to spend time eating their snacks and drinking another cup of their coffee. (Maybe a dippy).",5.0 star rating

"Quirky, chill cafe in a busy part of Market. I feel for this biz, because while it's in a bustling area, there's competing forces that make running a business here difficult, like its central location and frequenting of homeless people to use the bathroom. (Big props to the folks working here, though, who are kind enough to let many use the bathroom.)The barista was happy to see us, asked if we were from the area, and let us know about the gallery in the back. The art was by a gay artist with large, bold, cartoon-ish paintings; and I liked the brightness and humor in them.Tim M got the cajeta latte, which uses a slow-cooked caramel (like dulce de leche), and it was unique and very smooth. It had just the right amount of sweetness.

"A pentacle is a magical amulet worn around the neck from which some special energy is triggered that makes you act like comedian Rip Taylor. OK, I made the last part up, and despite the availability of a gender neutral restroom (photo: bit.ly/2rQwMef), that energy doesn't enhance the potential for bad jewelry either like a five-point star amulet at this casually hip corner spot that once housed a barber college. Note the traditional barber pole near the window (photo: bit.ly/2FrMdeF). However, local art does exist in a gallery in the back (photo: bit.ly/2GuPP0M), and that gives the place an esoteric facelift along with the provocative mural of the two semi-clad men in a longing embrace as they wear off-the-shoulder, color-coordinated robes in a field of poppies (photo: bit.ly/2BDCgse). What does it all mean?I haven't a clue, but you can ponder life's conundrums like I did with a satisfying $5.75 tumbler of Four Barrel Cajeta Latte with an additional dollar surcharge for the use of oat milk (photo: bit.ly/2DJ2ifD). It's still called Four Barrel, right? Anyway, $6.75 did seem a bit high for this battlefield of a 'hood. Seating comes at a premium here as well since there was just a couple of counter seats and a smallish communal table (photo: bit.ly/2DMsaet). I got the feeling the proprietors prefer it that way since the Starbucks crowd is not likely to be casually strolling by on Sixth Street to drop in at this edgy-artsy place. If they did, they could see some fine identity-inspired art on the outside walls on Jessie Street across Sixth (photo: bit.ly/2BD4nYF). Does it feel like gentrification here?

"Great spot off of the busy Market shopping craziness! I was welcomed by a very kind and nice barista who introduced the place and recommended the small gallery at the back where a local artist shows their work every couple of months. Cool space!The coffee (espresso) was very smooth and tasty. The place looks clean, with a couple of big tables to relax and enjoy your coffee! I will be back!",5.0 star rating
"The owner said they're going to swap the Nicaraguan component of their espresso blend for an Ethiopian bean in a couple weeks. (Said should result in more clear fruit notes, with less of a brown sugar, plum undertone).I thoroughly enjoyed the shot I had today and I'm looking forward to tasting the beans again in a couple weeks :)Reading the other reviews makes me want to try the oat milk also :)",5.0 star rating

"I like to support local businesses when I think they're quite good and I was impressed by Pentacle. The atmosphere is a gay haven from the likes of 6th Street with good espresso, an art gallery, & lots of lovely plants which I really appreciated. There is a simpleness to the menu, a contemporary flair, & of course I think this is an important place for the gay community to come congregate amongst the cool vibe. This is a great addition to our community with the SF Aids Foundation round the corner & the Needle Exchange across the road.",5.0 star rating

"Walked past this place a few weeks ago and it had been on my list. Finally got the chance to check this spot out and I was very happy with it. First the owner, Bobby, took the time to talk with me and just see how my day was going. Told a little about the place and some events coming up. I picked up the Cajeta Latte which was very good. While this might not be the best place for a sit down laptop session, it is a great spot to pick up some coffee, sit down for a chat, and enjoy the art in the back. Very clean space. I like that Bobby made it a point to not try and intrude in the area. As a new coffee shop, it can become easy to stand out in this neighborhood but this does the opposite. You can barely tell it is there. He really understands that this neighborhood has people there that look after each other and this little coffee spot is another hidden gem in the area.",5.0 star rating

"I've been meaning to go to Pentacle since they opened, and yesterday I finally stopped by. I'm glad that I did.  I was warmly welcomed by the owner and I ordered a macchiato. We chatted about the new place and he made me one of the best macchiatos I've tasted, nicely balanced, creamy, and delicious. I was on my way to lunch or I would've tried one of the yummy-looking pastries. As I enjoyed my coffee, I appreciated the beautiful mural at the front and  the lovely artwork in the gallery space in the back. The cafe was relatively busy but not too loud. People were chatting and interacting with the space and listening to the records the owner was playing. While a couple people were checking phones, it wasn't overrun with laptops and loud phone conversations. I wish I had more time to linger and read my book.I'll definitely be back to this great new addition to the neighborhood.",5.0 star rating

"Born and raised in the mission and utterly disappointed in the rude behavior of staff/manager of this place. I've gone here frequently in the past during quiet times with my dog. Not had an issue. This time Comment was made by this staff person that  "" too many dogs coming here"" . There were no dogs outside and only 2 people sitting outside at noon on a weekday.  I and my friend had 2 dogs and it was obvious that because they are german shepherds we were asked to leave. It was obvious that if the dogs had been the little squeaky types no comment would have been said.  Overall just rude behavior by someone who obviously doesn't like dogs  because her actions were not necessary as our dogs were behaving and on leash.",1.0 star rating

"Revolution Cafe opens onto a prime, well-trafficked Mission sidewalk and attracts good-sized crowds thanks to an open-air layout and daily schedule of live music that includes classical and jazz. Indeed, the Classical Revolution series of pop-up performances at cafes and intimate spaces grew out of this venue and has expanded to cover cities across the country and the world. As for the venue, it's a laid-back, casual affair during the day, with folks reading or working on laptops while enjoying some coffee or beer. It becomes more of a lounge when music acts take over. Service is rather perfunctory - indeed, they seem to be resting on their laurels a bit. It's more about the live music and lively atmosphere than the drinks or service. Nevertheless, the live acts, particularly the classical ones, can be quite decent and compelling. With things fast gentrifying here in the West Bay, it's great to see places like this with true local flavor continuing to go strong.",4.0 star rating

Don't advertise that you have soy milk on your menu then bitch and moan and say ""they ran out in the stores I heard it on the news"" because it'll make me think your incompetent and not good at sarcasm.

"If you're killing time in the Mission district or just looking for an unassuming cafe that has coffee, tea, pastries, and more importantly wifi/power outlets, then The Revolution Cafe is for you! Granted, there are only a few outlets, but the wifi is reliable and the vibe is laid back (unlike the bustle of a non-wifi establishment like Ritual Coffee Roasters).One thing I liked about this place is the live music which almost seems like it occurs everyday, most of the day. Sometimes the music is being played by a skillful/peaceful/quiet duo while other times it's a full blown loud band that can cramp your style if you're just trying to get some simple cafe ambience while working on something.I also liked how the place was cozy but with large open swinging front doors and big windows, lots of light comes in so you don't feel cooped up and more connected with the Mission district!",4.0 star rating

When I finally got the bagel (almost 10 minutes later) it was the wrong kind... pretty disappointed as I usually love coming.",3.0 star rating
"Had a terrible service experience here. I came around 10pm on a Tues wanting to have a tea and do some work. The server overcharged me a $1 for my tea. Not a big deal, I was going to put it in her tip jar anyway. I asked her for the wifi and she said there wasn't any. The guy at the table next to me was on a computer, so I asked him for the password and he gave it to me right away. It didn't work, so I went back to the counter to explain the situation. She was chatting with some friends at the side of the counter, and was not to be bothered for a while. She eventually looked my way but then curtly told me that she didn't know about the wifi, sorry! Then she went outside to smoke a cigarette outside with her friends while I watched another customer walk up to the counter and look around for service.

"I haven't written any Yelp reviews in awhile but this spot was too good not to write a review for! Cafe de Casa is home to the best Brazilian eats, not only in San Francisco, but in all of the Bay Area. We tried a whole lot of food because me and my boyfriend are major foodies, haha. Their coxinhas (croquettes with chicken & cheese) are so delicious, they're the best coxinhas we've ever had! The pao de queijo were surprisingly large and delicious. Note, ALL their pastries are large, so make sure you bring your stomach when you're eating here, actually bring all 3 of them!Their açaí bowls were so good! We loved how they had a ton of açaí in it! (You can usually tell when it's darker purple.) We loved all of the fresh fruit they put in it. For us we had strawberries, blueberries, bananas, and goji berries, it was definitely a healthy start to our day!We also had their yummy dried beef tapioca crepe. We love all things tapioca so this hit the spot! The dried beef was also super delicious, it had so much flavor and was well seasoned. It was the best we've had to date! The dish also included a small sauce dish full of olive oil, which the beef didn't need (since it was so well flavored)Their pineapple juice with mint was amazing, even my boyfriend agreed and he's not even the biggest fan of pineapple. So congrats, Cafe de Casa, you've gotten my boyfriend to like pineapple! Their pastries in general looked so amazing, we had to grab some to go, even though we'd already eaten a ton of food. Their service was friendly and typical of family owned establishments. We'd definitely be back again for a casual breakfast, brunch, or lunch. Can't wait to try that amazing pour over coffee next time!",5.0 star rating

"Cafe de Casa is a wonderful little find near Fisherman's Wharf. With snacks infused with Brazilian roots, this is a really unique experience.FOOD: The food was really unique. I've never had Brazilian food before. My friend and I split a couple things. The torta de frango had chicken, mozzarella cheese, corn, and olives. It was kind of like a chicken pot pie, but a lot tastier. The prosciutto crepe was very fresh. The crepe shell was unique because it was tapioca-based. Much better than o expected. The coxinha was a wonderfully cheesy/chicken-filled fried dough ball. I cannot rave about it enough! SERVICE: Fast. If you order a pastry, they heat it up very quickly for you. Crepes are made within a couple minute. The employees are courteous and they bring your food to you.AMBIANCE: The place is a little small so seating can be hard. However, the place is so quaint, clean, and quiet. Soft music plays in the background and makes it easy to converse with your friends.OVERALL: The food at Cafe de Casa is a unique experience. Brazilian food is hard to come by and it's a nice place to stop by for a snack.",5.0 star rating
"There were a Brazilian food options I wanted to choose, but I ended up just getting an Empada De Frango ($4) and a smoked salmon crepe ($13).The Empada De Frango tasted great. The outside was very doughy and crunchy. The inside kind of reminded me of canned tuna even though it had chicken in it. The crepe was ok and tasted a little plain. The olive oil did not add additional flavor. The outside was crunchy and the texture was kind of rough. At times, it was hard to cut through it. I was given a considerate amount of salmon and avocado. If I were to come back, I'll only get the pastries. Since they are already prepared, it is much faster to pick them up.",4.0 star rating
I can't get enough of Cafe de Casa. It's become my go-to breakfast spot for the weekends. The staff here are always so nice and lively (great representation of Brazil) and the food and drinks always so fresh and full of life.Recently I discovered a new favorite here aside from the pao de queijo and pastries. The prosciutto crepe is so bomb! They layer prosciutto with  fresh mozzarella and tomatoes. You pour the olive oil over the tapioca shell and dip into the spicy hot sauce (caution!) and you have one fantastic and exotic brunch.The passion fruit juice is amazing! The pineapple mint juice is amazing! The coffee is amazing!Keep doin' what you're doin'.,5.0 star rating
I came here because of the 4.5 star reviews on Yelp but unfortunately I wasn't very keen on neither their cafe com leite nor pao de queijo. I paid $7.05 for coffee & bread but I was underwhelmed by the quality considering they are pricier than NYC's O Cafe and not as great. The size of pao de queijo is bigger but not as flavorful as that of O Cafe in my opinion. It's a cute neighborhood coffee shop and the staff are nice but it failed to win my heart..... sorry!,3.0 star rating
"We ordered 2 pastries (which are displayed right behind the counter) and 2 coffees to go. There were about 4-5 people in front of us. I'm not exaggerating - we got our order 50 minutes later! I had to go feed the meter in the meantime. My suggestion to the manager: When people order food to be prepared vs. food that's already ready to go (eg.pastries), separate these two orders. Don't make someone just getting a cup of coffee wait for someone else's elaborate granola plate. I saw 3 granola orders prepared right in front of me - the server was creating a work of art with sliced bananas and blueberries at turtle speed. In the meantime, we're waiting our turn so we can grab our coffee and go. 50 minutes??? Come on, now. That's too slow.",2.0 star rating
"Coxinha- reminded me of underbaked fried bread with chicken and cheese. Inside was like raw dough.  Hard to go wrong with fried bread and cheese but was hoping for something with chunkier pieces of meat due to priceCheese bread- they're the size of a biscuit, unlike the popcorn sized ones commonly found in Rio de Janeiro.  However the taste, texture and gumminess  are about the same.  Just spensiff!Acai bowl- good.  They used a different type of sweetener than Basik Cafe or Earth Bar so it tastes different.  The $ per volume is also smaller than Basik and Earth Bar.",2.0 star rating
"Omg I ADORE this place. Near Fisherman's wharf, this is a lovely place for tourists to stop by when around the area. The cafe itself is quaint with limited seating indoors and outdoors, but just enough to house the flow of people coming in and out. The acai bowls at this place are giving my favorite acai place, Basik, a run for its money. The standard acai bowl comes with finely sliced bananas (don't like it when they're cut thick), strawberries, blueberries, a LOT of granola, and the best part, GOJI BERRIES! Presentation is beautiful too, topped with a mint leaf. The acai itself is creamy and smooth, and not too icy or watered down. It's worth every penny.As for the other yummy items on their menu, I've tried a couple of their Brazilian savory pastries. The dough is so soft and fresh, and the fillings are amazing. The one I got recently had a combination of corn, shredded chicken, olives, and heart of palms inside. Delish! Coming back to rotate through allll their options. It's also a great place to people watch if you sit along the window sill.",5.0 star rating

"Just a heads up: I'm being pretty harsh on this review because I grew up in Brazil and my parents owned a cafe there. I stopped by cafe de casa for breakfast in the middle of the week and it was pretty busy, a good sign that this restaurant will be good. I haven't had the Brazilian pastries, such as coxinhas and pasteis, in a very long time and was really looking forwards to trying it here!I ordered a pão de queijo, a coxinha, and an açaí smoothie. The two pastries were nice and warm. The coxinha was very well filled with chicken and creamy cheese (I'm not sure if it was cream cheese or the Brazilian creamy cheese caputipi). This was very filling and delicious. Although I had for breakfast, it would've been enough for lunch!The pão de queijo had a nice crust with the luscious interior with the perfect texture. I'm salivatingas I write this. I would give this place 11/10!Now you must be asking why the 4 stars (more like 4.5)? Well the açaí smoothie, although it was very smooth and well blended, I find that it wasn't cold enough for my liking (def personal preference), and it also wished it had a more rich açaí flavor. Overall, I had a great experience and would love to come back in the future!",4.0 star rating

"Amazing spot with delicious food that filled me up with saudade of Brazilian breakfasts in Brazil. Pao de queijo are exactly as they should be: big, fluffy, cheesy, hot, crispy on the outside and pillowy on the inside, YUM! The tapioca crepes are so good, filled with classic fillings and toppings, they are such a fun alternative to the usual crepes. Cafe de Casa also has three small tables outside but the slopped street adds an element of danger to having hot coffee on the small tables. Better take the food to go and enjoy the bay views a few blocks down.",5.0 star rating
