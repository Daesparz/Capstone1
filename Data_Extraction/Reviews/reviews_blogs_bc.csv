Names,Wifi,Review,Blog
Beacon Coffee & Pantry,Yes,"If you live in North Beach, Beacon is your best bet. It has adequate seating, good wifi (you’ll just need to buy something every once in a while), and a fair number of plugs. The food is good, too - provided you want something light like a bagel or some yogurt with granola. You can choose to sit at the bar facing the large window, or snag a table away from the distractions of the outdoors, if you can’t bear to watch the adventures of people who don’t currently have to work.",B
Contraband Coffeebar,Yes,"The baristas at Contraband take their coffee seriously - we’ve heard some intense coffee bean discussion going on in here, which is something to keep in mind if you like procrastination. There aren’t a ton of outlets, so get there early if you want to be sure you can get one. They have small food items like scones, and there are a few tables outside on the sidewalk for when the weather’s nice.",B
The Station SF,Yes,"An almost perfect FiDi coffee shop for getting business-related things (or even just some online shopping) done. They have strong coffee, comfortable chairs, and rock-solid wifi. If you don’t have time to wait in an eight-second line, there’s even a refrigerated case and self-checkout system near the entrance with small things to eat and drink. If you can spare the wait time, though, there’s a full breakfast and lunch menu. The only real drawback to The Station is the lack of outlets inside - most likely to dissuade people like you from camping out for too long.",B
Mazarine Coffee,No,"There’s no shame in loving a beautiful avocado toast. OK, there’s some shame. But Mazarine has some of the prettiest ones around, as well as nice-looking lattes, and both things actually taste good, too. Also actually-important is the fact that this FiDi spot has an almost ridiculous number of outlets. Just bring your internet with you, or do something you don’t need any internet for, if you can think of anything.",B
Verve Coffee Roasters,Yes,"Verve has almost everything you need for a full day of work. You’ll find a bunch of comfy couches, group tables with lots of laptop space to exploit the wifi, and some of the best coffee around. Just know that there is only one plug here, so make sure you’re charged up beforehand. They have the requisite avocado toast, plus sandwiches - and, most importantly, biscuits. Bad for laptop keyboard cleanliness, but that’s why they invented those sanitary wipe things.",B
Ritual Coffee Roasters,No,"For the purists out there, this is a coffee shop focused on the coffee. With no wifi and a menu consisting only of pastries, Ritual is where you go when you really need to focus and can’t be distracted by the latest Everlane email in your inbox. The nitro coffee is fantastic, and if you need sustenance, the croissants are quite good.",B
Philz Coffee,Yes,"Philz is now a VC-backed operation, and we would not be surprised if the reason for that was their Mint Mojito Iced Coffee, a.k.a. dessert masquerading as an acceptable adult drink. Grab one and get to work at the Philz Castro location: low-key, spacious, and with great people-watching on Castro Street when you need a break.",B
Mercury Cafe,Yes,"Mercury Cafe is bright, airy, and unpretentious - exactly what you want in a neighborhood coffee shop. Come first thing in the morning to try their freshly-baked scones (they will sell out), or stop by in the afternoon and order a slice of their homemade pies (go for the apple). Mercury is one of the more relaxing places to work, and the numerous outlets are key. Nothing like the impending stress of 8% battery to cramp your productivity.",B
Jane on Fillmore,Yes,"With its retro tabletops and killer music selection, Jane on Fillmore is the It Girl of coffee shops: cool without trying too hard. If you can get a table, try their Stumptown coffee and egg white sandwiches. They also have some pretty incredible pastries in rotation (and gluten-free things if that’s your game), not to mention huge and delicious salads. Add a good number of outlets and free wifi, and it's obvious why this is one of our go-tos. The Larkin location has the same menu, but there’s no wifi there.",B
Saint Frank,Yes,"Clean and modern, this well-designed Russian Hill coffee shop is chill enough to make you feel like you’re in a sci-fi utopia. And the almond macadamia latte is made with house-made almond milk, because of course it is.",B
Nook,Yes,"Nook is on the smaller side – if you’re traveling with an entourage of accessories, table space may be an issue. But otherwise, this Nob Hill cafe is a great place to grab lunch and get some work done. Skip the salads and go for the hummus plate with pita, cucumbers, and tomatoes, or the smoked salmon bagel.",B
Réveille Coffee Co.,Yes,"This North Beach spot is a good place to hang all day, and as long as you can find space (it gets crowded), that’s what you should do: stay through lunch and feed yourself with salads and quinoa bowls. There are basically no downsides, except there being not a ton of outlets. The Castro location is great, too, if you’re on that side of town.",B
Duboce Park Cafe,Yes,"As if you really needed another reason to visit, Duboce Park Cafe is named after the adorable dog park across the street. Ignore the breakfast menu and get the big house salad: mixed greens, sliced apple, fennel, pecans, and cheese. Then proceed to look at dogs rather than your empty Word document. Be careful, though - if the dogs distract you and your laptop dies, there are no plugs here to save you.",B
Atlas Cafe,Yes,"Nothing fancy, but a decent place to read, write, and obsessively overthink some emails to your coworkers. There’s a sizeable indoor space, a back patio for when it’s nice out, a full menu, and drinks ranging from coffee (of course) to beer and wine. Tartine Manufactory is close by, too, in case you’d like to take a stroll for some of their pastries and/or delicious ice cream.",B
The Grove,No,"The Grove Hayes is more cafeteria than coffee shop, but it’s a solid place to grab lunch and do some reading or writing without getting distracted by Twitter (which you'll need to check on your phone). Go for the Berkeley Bowl salad, with mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, chickpeas, and avocado. Also, they serve beer and wine and are not in any way related to the outdoor mall by the same name in LA.",B
The Interval at Long Now,,"The only serious cocktail bar on this list, The Interval at Long Now also doubles as a cafe, museum and the home of The Long Now Foundation. To say its one-of-a-kind is an understatement. Home to “Conversations at The Interval,” which are intimate salon style events, centered around long-term thinking, featuring renowned authors, scientists and artists paired with a cocktail program, coffee, tea and bites.",C
20th Century Cafe,,"“Deliciously glamorous,” 20th Century Cafe was born of the owner’s idea for a little “grand” cafe. And grand it is, drawing flavor profiles from the owner’s travels through Vienna, Budapest and Prague coupled with a love of California produce. It’s a cafe to while away an afternoon, sipping and nibbling on a variety of goods baked with 20 years worth of love and experience.",C
Sightglass Coffee,,"Kicking off this list is none other than Sightglass Coffee, whose 7th Street flagship space is a production roastery, dynamic open coffee bar, community gathering space and company headquarters. You’ll also find a completely customizable affogatto bar here (read: espresso + ice cream), which is basically like the best ice cream parlor in the world + coffee.",C
Verve,,"Verve isn’t simply a coffee house it’s an inspired institution, born in Santa Cruz with outposts in San Francisco, Santa Cruz, Los Angeles and Japan. The SF cafe is located right on Market St. and is punctuated by light wood, swashes of dark navy, sweet succulents and the aroma of coffee done right, from farm to street level.",C
The Mill SF,,"At The Mill SF, they “baked some bread and milled some coffee for you,” except they spend all their waking hours (and non) working on these two beautifully simple, yet complex things. The coffee is hand-roasted in their vintage roaster after spending months of the year with coffee growers in East Africa and millers in Latin America. The bread is Josey Baker Bread, born of a Mission apartment in 2010, now they bake about 350 loaves a day, 7 days a week. And if you’re craving a little something else, stop by from 6-9p every day for a slice of pizza, homemade of course.",C
Cafe Réveille,,"Cafe Réveille is a study in serious coffee paired with a playful and inviting design, which is punctuated by modern pops of pink. Choose from two locations in SF, Mission Bay and the Lower Haight, and let this sweet shop cure all your caffeine cravings while also being a banging brunch spot with a full, delicious menu.",C
Trouble Coffee,,"With an ethos of truth and trouble, Trouble Coffee has three, unique locations in the Bay Area – Ocean Beach, Bayview and West Oakland. Born of a dream and built from scraps and friendship, these coffeehouses are serving soul on tap. Each cafe tells a chapter of the owner’s life and has become a network of resources for those looking for a cup of beautifully brewed coffee or instructions on how to build a literal or proverbial house.",C
Blue Bottle Coffee,,"In the midst of Giants Stadium, the Bay Bridge and the Bay itself lies a smaller gathering space with just as much ambition. Blue Bottle Coffee, renowned much the world over, is constantly innovating and creating new methods for the enjoyment of coffee. This cafe will debut their first-ever bar for mixed coffee drinks, cold bar, where single origins, Oji and cold brew will be alternately shaken or stirred in various cocktail-inspired preparations. But expect familiar Blue Bottle favorites like pour-overs, fruit buckles and a delicious menu.",C
Four Barrel Coffee,,"Four Barrel Coffee is an independent, locally owned coffee roastery with a pair of cafes under their collective belts, while also being partners in The Mill SF (also on this list). Hidden at the end of a nondescript alleyway lies the uber cool Portola location, where a latte and pistachio croissant will make any day instantly brighter.",C
Mission Heirloom,,"While it is not technically in SF (but well worth the sojourn), Mission Heirloom is a study in gastronomy for a coffee shop, serving re-imagined traditions with top-notch ingredients, all organic, gluten and grain free, in a greenhouse complete with edible garden. Sip, savor and nosh in a greenhouse, or stop by the marketplace and pick up the freshest fare and a cup to go.",C
Paramo Coffee,,"With a variety of rave reviews and ""Top Coffee Shop"" lists under their brewing belts, Paramo Coffee is still unassuming, straightforward and forthright in putting the partner goods they carry in the limelight. Their espresso and milk is “life changing” and the quiet space a perfect escape for a quiet morning or place to work without distraction.",C
Le Marais Bakery,,"What would this list be without the most perfect French cafe, bistro and bakery to be both lost and deliciously found in? Le Marais Bakery, based on the French boulangerie of the owner’s childhood is covetable tilework, delicate cafe chairs, Tiffany blue accents and the most beautiful pastries we’ve seen this side of the Seine. House made beignets, croissants, breads and pastries filled with farm fruits and Valrhona chocolate pair perfectly with superb lattes and fresh brews.",C
Hollow,,"The epitome of a word-of-mouth local hotspot, Hollow is the coffee heart and soul of the Inner Sunset neighborhood. Beautifully poured lattes and a variety of homemade baked goods punctuate a shop that personifies the inviting ethos “cold hands, warm coffee,” a port in the storm of life if you will.",C
Saint Frank,,"Named for the city of San Francisco or “more specifically the beloved Saint Francis who showed all things seemingly mundane and ordinary to be special,” Saint Frank is certainly the spot for a very special cup of coffee. With four locations throughout the city, one accessible only to Facebook employees and a roastery, the Saint Francis model is clearly working. Intentionally sourced coffee, served in a variety of ways - flights, cuppings, limited time signature drinks, all in utterly lovely and thoughtful cafes you won’t want to leave.",C
Red Door Coffee,,"The self-proclaimed “dopest coffee shop in SOMA,” Red Door Coffee may be just that. Proudly serving some of San Fran’s finest in coffee (Four Barrel), tea (David Rio), donuts (Dynamo Donuts) and bread (Josey Baker Bread), among others, in a modern, almost futuristic setting.",C
Ritual Coffee Roasters,,"When speaking about San Francisco coffee, Ritual Coffee Roasters isn’t simply inthe conversation, it started the conversation, almost 13 years ago now. Started as a love note to a beloved city, owner Eileen Rinaldi picked locations for all her cafes based on where she wants to spend her “moments before the days get crazy.” With six locations throughout the city serving “the best cup of coffee available anywhere,” including a sweet spot in a shipping container and the new “Cup and Star Bar” open at the Oxbow Public Market, it’s clear San Francisco has embraced this beautiful brand as well. ",C
Mazarine Coffee,,"Inspired by the story of the Bibliothèque Mazarine, the first public library in France, Mazarine Coffee can be thought of as an artfully assembled collection of sourced coffees, food and beverages. It’s also a lovely spot to sit and enjoy a quiet moment alone or an engaging conversation with a friend.",C
