    "Intencionality of reviews written by bloggers or customers could be purely *descriptive*, telling readers what must they expect visiting one particular coffee shop or *argumentative*, sharing their own experience to incentive people going or not at the place. Every message contains one or all of those intencionalities and for extracting the maximum of possible information, polarity and subjectivity patterns are searching on each sentence into reviews.\n",

    "Global analysis of reviews takes each one as a whole entity or **paragraph** and we look for correlations between polarity patterns and scores. Then, they are split into **sentences** for discovering the intentionality of the parts of the message. Are people putting more emphasys and strong intention in positive or negative messages (polarity vs subjectivity)? About the location of the information on every paragraph, could be tested the law of primacy in persuasion? \n",

Inspecting the frequency of reviews/coffee shops, how much different are the distributions for positive gradients (positive review after than a negative), negative gradients (negative review after than a positive), consecutive-positive and consecutive negative?\n"
